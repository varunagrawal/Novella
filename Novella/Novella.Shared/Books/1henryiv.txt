Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=To be commenced in strands afar remote.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=All of one nature, of one substance bred,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Did lately meet in the intestine shock
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And furious close of civil butchery
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=March all one way and be no more opposed
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=We are impressed and engaged to fight,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=To chase these pagans in those holy fields
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=For our advantage on the bitter cross.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=What yesternight our council did decree
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=In forwarding this dear expedience.
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=My liege, this haste was hot in question,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=And many limits of the charge set down
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=But yesternight: when all athwart there came
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=A thousand of his people butchered;
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=Such beastly shameless transformation,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=By those Welshwomen done as may not be
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=Without much shame retold or spoken of.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=It seems then that the tidings of this broil
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=For more uneven and unwelcome news
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=Came from the north and thus it did import:
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=At Holmedon met,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=As by discharge of their artillery,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=And shape of likelihood, the news was told;
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=For he that brought them, in the very heat
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=And pride of their contention did take horse,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=Uncertain of the issue any way.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Stain'd with the variation of each soil
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And is not this an honourable spoil?
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=In faith,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=In envy that my Lord Northumberland
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Should be the father to so blest a son,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=See riot and dishonour stain the brow
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=Malevolent to you in all aspects;
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=The crest of youth against your dignity.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=But I have sent for him to answer this;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And for this cause awhile we must neglect
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=But come yourself with speed to us again;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=For more is to be said and to be done
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Than out of anger can be uttered.
Dialogue:WESTMORELAND=I will, my liege.

Notice:Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=the time of the day.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=thou wilt have none,--
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=What, none?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=prologue to an egg and butter.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=us that are squires of the night's body be called
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=buff jerkin?
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=time and oft.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=and where it would not, I have used my credit.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=No; thou shalt.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=you.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=For obtaining of suits?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Moor-ditch?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=lord of the council rated me the other day in the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=streets, and no man regards it.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=should speak truly, little better than one of the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=I'll be damned for never a king's son in
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Christendom.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF='Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=do not, call me villain and baffle me.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=to purse-taking.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=man to labour in his vocation.
Notice:Enter POINS
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=a true man.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Good morrow, Ned.
Dialogue:POINS=Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?
Dialogue:POINS=what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
Dialogue:POINS=agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
Dialogue:POINS=soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
Dialogue:POINS=and a cold capon's leg?
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
Dialogue:POINS=Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
Dialogue:POINS=But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four
Dialogue:POINS=o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going
Dialogue:POINS=to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
Dialogue:POINS=riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
Dialogue:POINS=for you all; you have horses for yourselves:
Dialogue:POINS=Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
Dialogue:POINS=supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
Dialogue:POINS=as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
Dialogue:POINS=your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry
Dialogue:POINS=at home and be hanged.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=I'll hang you for going.
Dialogue:POINS=You will, chops?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Hal, wilt thou make one?
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Why, that's well said.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I care not.
Dialogue:POINS=Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:
Dialogue:POINS=I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
Dialogue:POINS=that he shall go.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=move and what he hears may be believed, that the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!
Notice:Exit Falstaff
Dialogue:POINS=Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
Dialogue:POINS=to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
Dialogue:POINS=manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill
Dialogue:POINS=shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
Dialogue:POINS=yourself and I will not be there; and when they
Dialogue:POINS=have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut
Dialogue:POINS=this head off from my shoulders.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=How shall we part with them in setting forth?
Dialogue:POINS=Why, we will set forth before or after them, and
Dialogue:POINS=appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at
Dialogue:POINS=our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure
Dialogue:POINS=upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have
Dialogue:POINS=no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=horses, by our habits and by every other
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=appointment, to be ourselves.
Dialogue:POINS=Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
Dialogue:POINS=in the wood; our vizards we will change after we
Dialogue:POINS=leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram
Dialogue:POINS=for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
Dialogue:POINS=Well, for two of them, I know them to be as
Dialogue:POINS=true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the
Dialogue:POINS=third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll
Dialogue:POINS=forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
Dialogue:POINS=incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
Dialogue:POINS=tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at
Dialogue:POINS=least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what
Dialogue:POINS=extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this
Dialogue:POINS=lies the jest.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=there I'll sup. Farewell.
Dialogue:POINS=Farewell, my lord.
Notice:Exit Poins
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I know you all, and will awhile uphold
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=The unyoked humour of your idleness:
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=To smother up his beauty from the world,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=That, when he please again to be himself,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=If all the year were playing holidays,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=To sport would be as tedious as to work;
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=So, when this loose behavior I throw off
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=And pay the debt I never promised,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=By how much better than my word I am,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Redeeming time when men think least I will.

Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Unapt to stir at these indignities,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And you have found me; for accordingly
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=You tread upon my patience: but be sure
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=I will from henceforth rather be myself,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;

Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And majesty might never yet endure

Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=As is deliver'd to your majesty:
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=Either envy, therefore, or misprison
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=But I remember, when the fight was done,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=He was perfumed like a milliner;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=He gave his nose and took't away again;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=With many holiday and lady terms
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Out of my grief and my impatience,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=He should or he should not; for he made me mad
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And that it was great pity, so it was,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=He would himself have been a soldier.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I answer'd indirectly, as I said;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And I beseech you, let not his report
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Come current for an accusation
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
Dialogue:SIR WALTER BLUNT=The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,

Dialogue:SIR WALTER BLUNT=To such a person and in such a place,

Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=But with proviso and exception,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=The lives of those that he did lead to fight
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=For I shall never hold that man my friend
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Revolted Mortimer!
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=But by the chance of war; to prove that true
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=In single opposition, hand to hand,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=He did confound the best part of an hour
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Three times they breathed and three times did
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=they drink,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Never did base and rotten policy
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Colour her working with such deadly wounds;

Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=Here comes your uncle.
Notice:Re-enter WORCESTER
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Speak of Mortimer!
Dialogue:HOTSPUR='Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Want mercy, if I do not join with him:
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=As high in the air as this unthankful king,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And when I urged the ransom once again
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=He was; I heard the proclamation:
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=And then it was when the unhappy king,
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=Upon his Irish expedition;
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=From whence he intercepted did return
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=To be deposed and shortly murdered.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Heir to the crown?
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=He did; myself did hear it.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=But shall it be that you, that set the crown
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Upon the head of this forgetful man
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And for his sake wear the detested blot
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Of murderous subornation, shall it be,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=That you a world of curses undergo,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Being the agents, or base second means,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=O, pardon me that I descend so low,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To show the line and the predicament
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Wherein you range under this subtle king;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=That men of your nobility and power
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Into the good thoughts of the world again,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Of this proud king, who studies day and night
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To answer all the debt he owes to you
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Therefore, I say--
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=                  Peace, cousin, say no more:
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=And now I will unclasp a secret book,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=And to your quick-conceiving discontents
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=As full of peril and adventurous spirit
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Send danger from the east unto the west,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=So honour cross it from the north to south,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=Imagination of some great exploit
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Without corrival, all her dignities:
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=But out upon this half-faced fellowship!
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=He apprehends a world of figures here,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=But not the form of what he should attend.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Good cousin, give me audience for a while.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I cry you mercy.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=                  Those same noble Scots
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=That are your prisoners,--
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I'll keep them all;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I'll keep them, by this hand.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=You start away
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=And lend no ear unto my purposes.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Those prisoners you shall keep.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Nay, I will; that's flat:
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=He said he would not ransom Mortimer;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=But I will find him when he lies asleep,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Nay,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To keep his anger still in motion.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Hear you, cousin; a word.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=All studies here I solemnly defy,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=But that I think his father loves him not
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And would be glad he met with some mischance,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=When you are better temper'd to attend.
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR='Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--
Dialogue:HOTSPUR='Sblood!--
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=At Berkley castle.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=You say true:
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Nay, if you have not, to it again;
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=We will stay your leisure.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I have done, i' faith.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=And make the Douglas' son your only mean
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Which I shall send you written, be assured,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Will easily be granted. You, my lord,
Notice:To Northumberland
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Shall secretly into the bosom creep
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=The archbishop.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Of York, is it not?
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=True; who bears hard
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=I speak not this in estimation,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=As what I think might be, but what I know
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Is ruminated, plotted and set down,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=And only stays but to behold the face
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And then the power of Scotland and of York,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To join with Mortimer, ha?
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=And so they shall.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=To save our heads by raising of a head;
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=The king will always think him in our debt,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=And see already how he doth begin
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=To make us strangers to his looks of love.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Than I by letters shall direct your course.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Which now we hold at much uncertainty.
Dialogue:NORTHUMBERLAND=Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!

Dialogue:GADSHILL=What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,

Dialogue:LADY PERCY=A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=And given my treasures and my rights of thee
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=And all the currents of a heady fight.
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Such as we see when men restrain their breath
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,

Dialogue:LADY PERCY=An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Away,

Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Come, wilt thou see me ride?
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And when I am on horseback, I will swear
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I must not have you henceforth question me
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I know you wise, but yet no farther wise
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,

Dialogue:FALSTAFF=nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a

Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Where is it, Jack? where is it?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=poor four of us.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=What, a hundred, man?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=miracle. I am eight times thrust through the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=through and through; my sword hacked like a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Speak, sirs; how was it?
Dialogue:GADSHILL=We four set upon some dozen--
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Sixteen at least, my lord.
Dialogue:GADSHILL=And bound them.
Dialogue:PETO=No, no, they were not bound.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.
Dialogue:GADSHILL=As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=What, fought you with them all?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Pray God you have not murdered some of them.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=What, four? thou saidst but two even now.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Four, Hal; I told thee four.
Dialogue:POINS=Ay, ay, he said four.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=points in my target, thus.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Seven? why, there were but four even now.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=In buckram?
Dialogue:POINS=Ay, four, in buckram suits.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Dost thou hear me, Hal?
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=in buckram that I told thee of--
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=So, two more already.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Their points being broken,--
Dialogue:POINS=Down fell their hose.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=the eleven I paid.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=not see thy hand.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=These lies are like their father that begets them;
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=the truth?
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?
Dialogue:POINS=Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=compulsion, I.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine

Dialogue:FALSTAFF=standing-tuck,--
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=hear me speak but this.
Dialogue:POINS=Mark, Jack.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=apparent shame?
Dialogue:POINS=Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be

Dialogue:BARDOLPH='Faith, I ran when I saw others run.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY='Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=sword so hacked?
Dialogue:PETO=Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would
Dialogue:PETO=swear truth out of England but he would make you
Dialogue:PETO=believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.
Dialogue:BARDOLPH=Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to
Dialogue:BARDOLPH=make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments
Dialogue:BARDOLPH=with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I
Dialogue:BARDOLPH=did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
Dialogue:BARDOLPH=to hear his monstrous devices.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and

Dialogue:FALSTAFF=shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=art not thou horrible afeard? thou being
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=it?
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=particulars of my life.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=crown for a pitiful bald crown!
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=in King Cambyses' vein.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Well, here is my leg.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.
Dialogue:Hostess=O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.
Dialogue:Hostess=O, the father, how he holds his countenance!
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.
Dialogue:Hostess=O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry
Dialogue:Hostess=players as ever I see!
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=What manner of man, an it like your majesty?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=thou been this month?
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=and I'll play my father.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Well, here I am set.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=And here I stand: judge, my masters.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Now, Harry, whence come you?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=My noble lord, from Eastcheap.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF='Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=ye for a young prince, i' faith.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=I would your grace would take me with you: whom
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=means your grace?
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=That villanous abominable misleader of youth,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=My lord, the man I know.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I know thou dost.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=were to say more than I know. That he is old, the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I do, I will.

Dialogue:FALSTAFF=say in the behalf of that Falstaff.
Notice:Re-enter the Hostess
Dialogue:Hostess=O Jesu, my lord, my lord!
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=what's the matter?
Dialogue:Hostess=The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they
Dialogue:Hostess=are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=without seeming so.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=And thou a natural coward, without instinct.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=conscience.

Notice:Enter Sheriff and the Carrier
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?
Dialogue:Sheriff=First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry
Dialogue:Sheriff=Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=What men?
Dialogue:Sheriff=One of them is well known, my gracious lord,
Dialogue:Sheriff=A gross fat man.
Dialogue:Carrier=                  As fat as butter.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=The man, I do assure you, is not here;
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=For I myself at this time have employ'd him.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Send him to answer thee, or any man,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=For any thing he shall be charged withal:
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=And so let me entreat you leave the house.
Dialogue:Sheriff=I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
Dialogue:Sheriff=Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=He shall be answerable; and so farewell.
Dialogue:Sheriff=Good night, my noble lord.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I think it is good morrow, is it not?
Dialogue:Sheriff=Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.
Notice:Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,

Dialogue:PETO=Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and
Dialogue:PETO=snorting like a horse.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.
Notice:He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=What hast thou found?
Dialogue:PETO=Nothing but papers, my lord.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Let's see what they be: read them.

Dialogue:PETO=Item, Sauce,. . . 4d.
Dialogue:PETO=Item, Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8d.
Dialogue:PETO=Item, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.
Dialogue:PETO=Item, Bread,        ob.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=charge of foot; and I know his death will be a
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.

Banner:SCENE I. Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.
Notice:Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER
Dialogue:MORTIMER=These promises are fair, the parties sure,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And our induction full of prosperous hope.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Will you sit down?
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I have forgot the map.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=No, here it is.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=For by that name as oft as Lancaster
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=I cannot blame him: at my nativity
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Of burning cressets; and at my birth
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=The frame and huge foundation of the earth
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Shaked like a coward.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Why, so it would have done at the same season, if
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=had never been born.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=I say the earth did shake when I was born.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And I say the earth was not of my mind,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And not in fear of your nativity.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=By the imprisoning of unruly wind
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=In passion shook.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=                  Cousin, of many men
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=To tell you once again that at my birth
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=And all the courses of my life do show
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=I am not in the roll of common men.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=And bring him out that is but woman's son
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=And hold me pace in deep experiments.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I'll to dinner.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Why, so can I, or so can any man;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=But will they come when you do call for them?
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=The devil.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Home without boots, and in foul weather too!
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=According to our threefold order ta'en?
Dialogue:MORTIMER=The archdeacon hath divided it
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Into three limits very equally:
Dialogue:MORTIMER=England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=By south and east is to my part assign'd:
Dialogue:MORTIMER=All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And all the fertile land within that bound,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you
Dialogue:MORTIMER=The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And our indentures tripartite are drawn;
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Which being sealed interchangeably,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=A business that this night may execute,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
Dialogue:MORTIMER=To meet your father and the Scottish power,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=My father Glendower is not ready yet,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Within that space you may have drawn together
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=And in my conduct shall your ladies come;
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=For there will be a world of water shed
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Upon the parting of your wives and you.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=In quantity equals not one of yours:
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=See how this river comes me cranking in,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And cuts me from the best of all my land
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=In a new channel, fair and evenly;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To rob me of so rich a bottom here.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Yea, but
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
Dialogue:MORTIMER=With like advantage on the other side;
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Gelding the opposed continent as much
Dialogue:MORTIMER=As on the other side it takes from you.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=And on this north side win this cape of land;
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=And then he runs straight and even.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=I'll not have it alter'd.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Will not you?
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=No, nor you shall not.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Who shall say me nay?
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Why, that will I.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=I can speak English, lord, as well as you;
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=For I was train'd up in the English court;
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Where, being but young, I framed to the harp
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Many an English ditty lovely well
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=A virtue that was never seen in you.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Marry,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And I am glad of it with all my heart:
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
Dialogue:HOTSPUR='Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To any well-deserving friend;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=The moon shines fair; you may away by night:
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=I'll haste the writer and withal
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Break with your wives of your departure hence:
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=So much she doteth on her Mortimer.
Notice:Exit GLENDOWER
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And of a dragon and a finless fish,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=A couching lion and a ramping cat,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=He held me last night at least nine hours
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=In reckoning up the several devils' names
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=As a tired horse, a railing wife;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=In any summer-house in Christendom.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Exceedingly well read, and profited
Dialogue:MORTIMER=In strange concealments, valiant as a lion
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
Dialogue:MORTIMER=As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?
Dialogue:MORTIMER=He holds your temper in a high respect
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And curbs himself even of his natural scope
Dialogue:MORTIMER=When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:
Dialogue:MORTIMER=I warrant you, that man is not alive
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Might so have tempted him as you have done,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Without the taste of danger and reproof:
Dialogue:MORTIMER=But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=And since your coming hither have done enough
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=To put him quite beside his patience.
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Defect of manners, want of government,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=The least of which haunting a nobleman
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Beguiling them of commendation.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.
Notice:Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies
Dialogue:MORTIMER=This is the deadly spite that angers me;
Dialogue:MORTIMER=My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
Notice:Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=one that no persuasion can do good upon.
Notice:The lady speaks in Welsh
Dialogue:MORTIMER=I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
Dialogue:MORTIMER=I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=In such a parley should I answer thee.
Notice:The lady speaks again in Welsh
Dialogue:MORTIMER=I understand thy kisses and thou mine,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And that's a feeling disputation:
Dialogue:MORTIMER=But I will never be a truant, love,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=With ravishing division, to her lute.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.
Notice:The lady speaks again in Welsh
Dialogue:MORTIMER=O, I am ignorance itself in this!
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=As is the difference betwixt day and night
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Begins his golden progress in the east.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
Dialogue:MORTIMER=By that time will our book, I think, be drawn
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Do so;
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=And those musicians that shall play to you
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,
Dialogue:GLENDOWER=And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Go, ye giddy goose.
Notice:The music plays
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=By'r lady, he is a good musician.
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=and hear the lady sing in Welsh.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=No.
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Then be still.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Neither;'tis a woman's fault.
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Now God help thee!
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To the Welsh lady's bed.
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=What's that?
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Peace! she sings.
Notice:Here the lady sings a Welsh song

Dialogue:LADY PERCY=Not mine, in good sooth.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a

Dialogue:HOTSPUR='as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and
Dialogue:HOTSPUR='as sure as day,'
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=Come, sing.
Dialogue:LADY PERCY=I will not sing.

Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=For we shall presently have need of you.
Notice:Exeunt Lords
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=I know not whether God will have it so,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=For some displeasing service I have done,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=But thou dost in thy passages of life
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Could such inordinate and low desires,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Such barren pleasures, rude society,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Accompany the greatness of thy blood
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And hold their level with thy princely heart?
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=So please your majesty, I would I could
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Quit all offences with as clear excuse
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=As well as I am doubtless I can purge
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Myself of many I am charged withal:
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Yet such extenuation let me beg,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=As, in reproof of many tales devised,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Find pardon on my true submission.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=At thy affections, which do hold a wing
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And art almost an alien to the hearts
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Of all the court and princes of my blood:
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=The hope and expectation of thy time
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Had I so lavish of my presence been,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Had still kept loyal to possession
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And left me in reputeless banishment,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=By being seldom seen, I could not stir
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=But like a comet I was wonder'd at;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=That men would tell their children 'This is he;'
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And dress'd myself in such humility
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Even in the presence of the crowned king.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=My presence, like a robe pontifical,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And won by rareness such solemnity.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=The skipping king, he ambled up and down
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Had his great name profaned with their scorns
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And gave his countenance, against his name,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Of every beardless vain comparative,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Grew a companion to the common streets,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=They surfeited with honey and began
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=More than a little is by much too much.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=So when he had occasion to be seen,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=As, sick and blunted with community,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Afford no extraordinary gaze,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Slept in his face and render'd such aspect
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=For thou has lost thy princely privilege
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=With vile participation: not an eye
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=But is a-weary of thy common sight,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Which now doth that I would not have it do,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Be more myself.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=                  For all the world
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=As thou art to this hour was Richard then
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And even as I was then is Percy now.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=He hath more worthy interest to the state
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Than thou the shadow of succession;
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=For of no right, nor colour like to right,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=What never-dying honour hath he got
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Holds from all soldiers chief majority
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And military title capital
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=This infant warrior, in his enterprises
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Enlarged him and made a friend of him,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Capitulate against us and are up.
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=Base inclination and the start of spleen
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=To fight against me under Percy's pay,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
Dialogue:KING HENRY IV=To show how much thou art degenerate.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Do not think so; you shall not find it so:
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I will redeem all this on Percy's head
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=And in the closing of some glorious day
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=When I will wear a garment all of blood
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=That this same child of honour and renown,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=For every honour sitting on his helm,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Would they were multitudes, and on my head
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=My shames redoubled! for the time will come,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=That I shall make this northern youth exchange
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=His glorious deeds for my indignities.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=And I will call him to so strict account,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=That he shall render every glory up,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=This, in the name of God, I promise here:
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=The which if He be pleased I shall perform,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I do beseech your majesty may salve
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.

Dialogue:FALSTAFF=action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=church! Company, villanous company, hath been the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=spoil of me.
Dialogue:BARDOLPH=Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=good compass: and now I live out of all order, out
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=of all compass.
Dialogue:BARDOLPH=Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs
Dialogue:BARDOLPH=be out of all compass, out of all reasonable
Dialogue:BARDOLPH=compass, Sir John.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Knight of the Burning Lamp.
Dialogue:BARDOLPH=Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=for the light in thy face, the son of utter
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the

Dialogue:FALSTAFF=perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap

Dialogue:Hostess=I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy
Dialogue:Hostess=by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair
Dialogue:Hostess=was never lost in my house before.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=to, you are a woman, go.
Dialogue:Hostess=Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never
Dialogue:Hostess=called so in mine own house before.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Go to, I know you well enough.
Dialogue:Hostess=No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know
Dialogue:Hostess=you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now
Dialogue:Hostess=you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought
Dialogue:Hostess=you a dozen of shirts to your back.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.
Dialogue:Hostess=Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight
Dialogue:Hostess=shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir

Dialogue:Hostess=He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.
Dialogue:Hostess=O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not
Dialogue:Hostess=how oft, that ring was copper!

Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.

Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=What sayest thou, Jack?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=bawdy-house; they pick pockets.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=What didst thou lose, Jack?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=grandfather's.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=A trifle, some eight-penny matter.
Dialogue:Hostess=So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your
Dialogue:Hostess=grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely
Dialogue:Hostess=of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said
Dialogue:Hostess=he would cudgel you.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=What! he did not?
Dialogue:Hostess=There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=go
Dialogue:Hostess=Say, what thing? what thing?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.
Dialogue:Hostess=I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou
Dialogue:Hostess=shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,
Dialogue:Hostess=setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to
Dialogue:Hostess=call me so.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=otherwise.
Dialogue:Hostess=Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=What beast! why, an otter.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=where to have her.
Dialogue:Hostess=Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any
Dialogue:Hostess=man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.
Dialogue:Hostess=So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you
Dialogue:Hostess=ought him a thousand pound.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=a million: thou owest me thy love.
Dialogue:Hostess=Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would
Dialogue:Hostess=cudgel you.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Did I, Bardolph?
Dialogue:BARDOLPH=Indeed, Sir John, you said so.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Yea, if he said my ring was copper.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=roaring of a lion's whelp.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=And why not as the lion?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=I do, I pray God my girdle break.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=were enriched with any other injuries but these, I
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=have more flesh than another man, and therefore more
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=It appears so by the story.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,

Dialogue:FALSTAFF=lad, how is that answered?
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to

Dialogue:FALSTAFF=O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=do it with unwashed hands too.
Dialogue:BARDOLPH=Do, my lord.
Dialogue:PRINCE HENRY=I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am

Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:

Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
Dialogue:EARL OF WORCESTER=Before not dreamt of.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=You strain too far.
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=I rather of his absence make this use:
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=It lends a lustre and more great opinion,
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=A larger dare to our great enterprise,

Dialogue:HOTSPUR=If we without his help can make a head
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=To push against a kingdom, with his help
Dialogue:HOTSPUR=We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.
