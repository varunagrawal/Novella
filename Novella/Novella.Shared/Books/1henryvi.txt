Dialogue:EXETER=How were they lost? what treachery was used?
Dialogue:Messenger=No treachery; but want of men and money.
Dialogue:Messenger=Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,
Dialogue:Messenger=That here you maintain several factions,
Dialogue:Messenger=And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
Dialogue:Messenger=You are disputing of your generals:
Dialogue:Messenger=One would have lingering wars with little cost;
Dialogue:Messenger=Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;
Dialogue:Messenger=A third thinks, without expense at all,
Dialogue:Messenger=By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.

Dialogue:Messenger=Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
Dialogue:Messenger=They pitched in the ground confusedly,
Dialogue:Messenger=To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
Dialogue:Messenger=More than three hours the fight continued;
Dialogue:Messenger=Where valiant Talbot above human thought
Dialogue:Messenger=Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
Dialogue:Messenger=Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
Dialogue:Messenger=Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:
Dialogue:Messenger=The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;
Dialogue:Messenger=All the whole army stood agazed on him:
Dialogue:Messenger=His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
Dialogue:Messenger=A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain
Dialogue:Messenger=And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
Dialogue:Messenger=Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,
Dialogue:Messenger=If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:
Dialogue:Messenger=He, being in the vaward, placed behind
Dialogue:Messenger=With purpose to relieve and follow them,
Dialogue:Messenger=Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.
Dialogue:Messenger=Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;
Dialogue:Messenger=Enclosed were they with their enemies:
Dialogue:Messenger=A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
Dialogue:Messenger=Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,
Dialogue:Messenger=Whom all France with their chief assembled strength
Dialogue:Messenger=Durst not presume to look once in the face.

Dialogue:BEDFORD=To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:
Dialogue:BEDFORD=Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,
Dialogue:BEDFORD=Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.
Dialogue:Messenger=So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;
Dialogue:Messenger=The English army is grown weak and faint:
Dialogue:Messenger=The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,
Dialogue:Messenger=And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,
Dialogue:Messenger=Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.
Dialogue:EXETER=Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
Dialogue:EXETER=Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,
Dialogue:EXETER=Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.
Dialogue:BEDFORD=I do remember it; and here take my leave,

Dialogue:CHARLES=The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
Dialogue:REIGNIER=I think, by some odd gimmors or device

Dialogue:Boy=Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars
Dialogue:Boy=In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,
Dialogue:Boy=And thence discover how with most advantage
Dialogue:Boy=They may vex us with shot, or with assault.
Dialogue:Boy=To intercept this inconvenience,
Dialogue:Boy=A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed;
Dialogue:Boy=And even these three days have I watch'd,
Dialogue:Boy=If I could see them.

Dialogue:SALISBURY=How wert thou handled being prisoner?
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.
Dialogue:TALBOT=The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner
Dialogue:TALBOT=Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;
Dialogue:TALBOT=For him was I exchanged and ransomed.
Dialogue:TALBOT=But with a baser man of arms by far
Dialogue:TALBOT=Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:
Dialogue:TALBOT=Which I, disdaining, scorn'd; and craved death,
Dialogue:TALBOT=Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.
Dialogue:TALBOT=In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired.
Dialogue:TALBOT=But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,
Dialogue:TALBOT=Whom with my bare fists I would execute,
Dialogue:TALBOT=If I now had him brought into my power.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.
Dialogue:TALBOT=With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.
Dialogue:TALBOT=In open market-place produced they me,
Dialogue:TALBOT=To be a public spectacle to all:
Dialogue:TALBOT=Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
Dialogue:TALBOT=The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
Dialogue:TALBOT=Then broke I from the officers that led me,
Dialogue:TALBOT=And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,
Dialogue:TALBOT=To hurl at the beholders of my shame:
Dialogue:TALBOT=My grisly countenance made others fly;
Dialogue:TALBOT=None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
Dialogue:TALBOT=In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
Dialogue:TALBOT=So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,
Dialogue:TALBOT=That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,
Dialogue:TALBOT=And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:
Dialogue:TALBOT=Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,
Dialogue:TALBOT=That walked about me every minute-while;
Dialogue:TALBOT=And if I did but stir out of my bed,
Dialogue:TALBOT=Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.

Dialogue:SALISBURY=Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Let me have your express opinions
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Where is best place to make our battery next.
Dialogue:GARGRAVE=I think, at the north gate; for there stand lords.
Dialogue:GLANSDALE=And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.
Dialogue:TALBOT=For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,

Dialogue:SALISBURY=O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!
Dialogue:GARGRAVE=O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!

Dialogue:TALBOT=Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:
Dialogue:TALBOT=How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?
Dialogue:TALBOT=One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
Dialogue:TALBOT=Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
Dialogue:TALBOT=That hath contrived this woful tragedy!
Dialogue:TALBOT=In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
Dialogue:TALBOT=Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
Dialogue:TALBOT=Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,
Dialogue:TALBOT=His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
Dialogue:TALBOT=Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,
Dialogue:TALBOT=One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:
Dialogue:TALBOT=The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
Dialogue:TALBOT=Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
Dialogue:TALBOT=If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
Dialogue:TALBOT=Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
Dialogue:TALBOT=Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
Dialogue:TALBOT=Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
Dialogue:TALBOT=Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;
Dialogue:TALBOT=Thou shalt not die whiles--
Dialogue:TALBOT=He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.
Dialogue:TALBOT=As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,
Dialogue:TALBOT=Remember to avenge me on the French.'
Dialogue:TALBOT=Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
Dialogue:TALBOT=Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
Dialogue:TALBOT=Wretched shall France be only in my name.

Dialogue:WARWICK=Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye;
Dialogue:WARWICK=I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement;
Dialogue:WARWICK=But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,
Dialogue:WARWICK=Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.
Dialogue:WARWICK=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=The truth appears so naked on my side
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=That any purblind eye may find it out.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=And on my side it is so well apparell'd,
Dialogue:SOMERSET=So clear, so shining and so evident
Dialogue:SOMERSET=That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Let him that is a true-born gentleman
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=And stands upon the honour of his birth,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,
Dialogue:SOMERSET=But dare maintain the party of the truth,
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.
Dialogue:WARWICK=I love no colours, and without all colour
Dialogue:WARWICK=Of base insinuating flattery
Dialogue:WARWICK=I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=I pluck this red rose with young Somerset
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=And say withal I think he held the right.
Dialogue:VERNON=Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,
Dialogue:VERNON=Till you conclude that he upon whose side
Dialogue:VERNON=The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
Dialogue:VERNON=Shall yield the other in the right opinion.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:
Dialogue:SOMERSET=If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=And I.
Dialogue:VERNON=Then for the truth and plainness of the case.
Dialogue:VERNON=I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,
Dialogue:VERNON=Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
Dialogue:SOMERSET=And fall on my side so, against your will.
Dialogue:VERNON=If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,
Dialogue:VERNON=Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
Dialogue:VERNON=And keep me on the side where still I am.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Well, well, come on: who else?
Dialogue:Lawyer=Unless my study and my books be false,
Dialogue:Lawyer=The argument you held was wrong in you:
Notice:To SOMERSET
Dialogue:Lawyer=In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.
Dialogue:Lawyer=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Now, Somerset, where is your argument?
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Here in my scabbard, meditating that
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=For pale they look with fear, as witnessing
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=The truth on our side.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=No, Plantagenet,
Dialogue:SOMERSET='Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,
Dialogue:SOMERSET=And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?
Dialogue:SOMERSET=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,
Dialogue:SOMERSET=That shall maintain what I have said is true,
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Away, away, good William de la Pole!
Dialogue:SOMERSET=We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.
Dialogue:WARWICK=Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset;
Dialogue:WARWICK=His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,
Dialogue:WARWICK=Third son to the third Edward King of England:
Dialogue:WARWICK=Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?
Dialogue:WARWICK=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=He bears him on the place's privilege,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=By him that made me, I'll maintain my words
Dialogue:SOMERSET=On any plot of ground in Christendom.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,
Dialogue:SOMERSET=For treason executed in our late king's days?
Dialogue:SOMERSET=And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?
Dialogue:SOMERSET=His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;
Dialogue:SOMERSET=And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=My father was attached, not attainted,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=For your partaker Pole and you yourself,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=I'll note you in my book of memory,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=To scourge you for this apprehension:
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;
Dialogue:SOMERSET=And know us by these colours for thy foes,
Dialogue:SOMERSET=For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Will I for ever and my faction wear,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Until it wither with me to my grave
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Or flourish to the height of my degree.

Dialogue:WARWICK=Shall be wiped out in the next parliament
Dialogue:WARWICK=Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;
Dialogue:WARWICK=And if thou be not then created York,
Dialogue:WARWICK=I will not live to be accounted Warwick.
Dialogue:WARWICK=Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,
Dialogue:WARWICK=Against proud Somerset and William Pole,
Dialogue:WARWICK=Will I upon thy party wear this rose:
Dialogue:WARWICK=And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,
Dialogue:WARWICK=Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,
Dialogue:WARWICK=Shall send between the red rose and the white
Dialogue:WARWICK=A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
Dialogue:WARWICK=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.
Dialogue:VERNON=In your behalf still will I wear the same.
Dialogue:Lawyer=And so will I.

Dialogue:MORTIMER=Nestor-like aged in an age of care,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,

Dialogue:MORTIMER=Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine

Dialogue:MORTIMER=But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?
Dialogue:First Gaoler=Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:
Dialogue:First Gaoler=We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber;
Dialogue:First Gaoler=And answer was return'd that he will come.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Before whose glory I was great in arms,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=This loathsome sequestration have I had:
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And even since then hath Richard been obscured,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Deprived of honour and inheritance.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=But now the arbitrator of despairs,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,

Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,

Dialogue:MORTIMER=That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?
Dialogue:MORTIMER=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=This day, in argument upon a case,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Among which terms he used his lavish tongue
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=And did upbraid me with my father's death:
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Else with the like I had requited him.
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=In honour of a true Plantagenet
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=And for alliance sake, declare the cause
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Was cursed instrument of his decease.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Discover more at large what cause that was,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=For I am ignorant and cannot guess.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=I will, if that my fading breath permit
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And death approach not ere my tale be done.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=The first-begotten and the lawful heir,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Of Edward king, the third of that descent:
Dialogue:MORTIMER=During whose reign the Percies of the north,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Finding his usurpation most unjust,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
Dialogue:MORTIMER=The reason moved these warlike lords to this
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Leaving no heir begotten of his body--
Dialogue:MORTIMER=I was the next by birth and parentage;
Dialogue:MORTIMER=For by my mother I derived am
Dialogue:MORTIMER=From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son
Dialogue:MORTIMER=To King Edward the Third; whereas he
Dialogue:MORTIMER=From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Being but fourth of that heroic line.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=But mark: as in this haughty attempt
Dialogue:MORTIMER=They laboured to plant the rightful heir,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=I lost my liberty and they their lives.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived
Dialogue:MORTIMER=From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Marrying my sister that thy mother was,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Again in pity of my hard distress
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Levied an army, weening to redeem
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And have install'd me in the diadem:
Dialogue:MORTIMER=But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=True; and thou seest that I no issue have
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And that my fainting words do warrant death;
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:
Dialogue:MORTIMER=But yet be wary in thy studious care.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=But yet, methinks, my father's execution
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=With silence, nephew, be thou politic:
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And like a mountain, not to be removed.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=But now thy uncle is removing hence:
Dialogue:MORTIMER=As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd
Dialogue:MORTIMER=With long continuance in a settled place.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=O, uncle, would some part of my young years
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Might but redeem the passage of your age!
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
Dialogue:MORTIMER=Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;

Dialogue:MORTIMER=And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes
Dialogue:MORTIMER=And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!

Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=BISHOP
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=With written pamphlets studiously devised,
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=Do it without invention, suddenly;
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=As I with sudden and extemporal speech
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=Purpose to answer what thou canst object.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Think not, although in writing I preferr'd
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=That therefore I have forged, or am not able
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=As very infants prattle of thy pride.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Thou art a most pernicious usurer,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Forward by nature, enemy to peace;
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=A man of thy profession and degree;
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=As well at London bridge as at the Tower.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=From envious malice of thy swelling heart.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=BISHOP
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=To give me hearing what I shall reply.
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=As he will have me, how am I so poor?
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=Or how haps it I seek not to advance
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=And for dissension, who preferreth peace
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=More than I do?--except I be provoked.
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=It is not that that hath incensed the duke:
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=It is, because no one should sway but he;
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=No one but he should be about the king;
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=And that engenders thunder in his breast
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=And makes him roar these accusations forth.
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=But he shall know I am as good--
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=As good!
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Thou bastard of my grandfather!
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=BISHOP
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=But one imperious in another's throne?
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Am I not protector, saucy priest?
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=BISHOP
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=And am not I a prelate of the church?
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And useth it to patronage his theft.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=BISHOP
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=Unreverent Gloster!
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Thou art reverent
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=BISHOP
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=Rome shall remedy this.
Dialogue:WARWICK=Roam thither, then.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=My lord, it were your duty to forbear.
Dialogue:WARWICK=Ay, see the bishop be not overborne.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Methinks my lord should be religious
Dialogue:SOMERSET=And know the office that belongs to such.
Dialogue:WARWICK=Methinks his lordship should be humbler;
Dialogue:WARWICK=it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.
Dialogue:WARWICK=State holy or unhallow'd, what of that?
Dialogue:WARWICK=Is not his grace protector to the king?
Dialogue:WARWICK=RICHARD
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=[Aside]  Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;
Dialogue:PLANTAGENET=Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?'

Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=My sighs and tears and will not once relent?
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Who should be pitiful, if you be not?
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Or who should study to prefer a peace.
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=If holy churchmen take delight in broils?
Dialogue:WARWICK=Yield, my lord protector; yield, Winchester;

Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=He shall submit, or I will never yield.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Compassion on the king commands me stoop;

Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=That malice was a great and grievous sin;
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=And will not you maintain the thing you teach,

Dialogue:WARWICK=BISHOP
Dialogue:OF WINCHESTER=Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;

Dialogue:ALENCON=By our proceeding in hostility;
Dialogue:ALENCON=And therefore take this compact of a truce,
Dialogue:ALENCON=Although you break it when your pleasure serves.
Dialogue:WARWICK=How say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?
Dialogue:CHARLES=It shall;
Dialogue:CHARLES=Only reserved, you claim no interest
Dialogue:CHARLES=In any of our towns of garrison.
Dialogue:YORK=Then swear allegiance to his majesty,
Dialogue:YORK=As thou art knight, never to disobey
Dialogue:YORK=Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,
Dialogue:YORK=Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.
Dialogue:YORK=So, now dismiss your army when ye please:
Dialogue:YORK=Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,
Dialogue:YORK=For here we entertain a solemn peace.

Banner:SCENE V. London. The palace.
Notice:Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER and EXETER
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Her virtues graced with external gifts
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=So am I driven by breath of her renown
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Where I may have fruition of her love.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Is but a preface of her worthy praise;
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=The chief perfections of that lovely dame
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Had I sufficient skill to utter them,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Would make a volume of enticing lines,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Able to ravish any dull conceit:
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=And, which is more, she is not so divine,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=So full-replete with choice of all delights,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=But with as humble lowliness of mind
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=She is content to be at your command;
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=To love and honour Henry as her lord.
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Therefore, my lord protector, give consent
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=That Margaret may be England's royal queen.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=So should I give consent to flatter sin.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Unto another lady of esteem:
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=How shall we then dispense with that contract,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And not deface your honour with reproach?
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=By reason of his adversary's odds:
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=And therefore may be broke without offence.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Her father is no better than an earl,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Although in glorious titles he excel.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Yes, lord, her father is a king,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=The King of Naples and Jerusalem;
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=And of such great authority in France
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=As his alliance will confirm our peace
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.
Dialogue:EXETER=Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,
Dialogue:EXETER=Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=That he should be so abject, base and poor,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Henry is able to enrich his queen
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=And not seek a queen to make him rich:
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Marriage is a matter of more worth
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Must be companion of his nuptial bed:
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=It most of all these reasons bindeth us,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=In our opinions she should be preferr'd.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=For what is wedlock forced but a hell,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=An age of discord and continual strife?
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=And is a pattern of celestial peace.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Approves her fit for none but for a king:
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=More than in women commonly is seen,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Will answer our hope in issue of a king;
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=For Henry, son unto a conqueror,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Is likely to beget more conquerors,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=If with a lady of so high resolve
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Whether it be through force of your report,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=My tender youth was never yet attaint
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=With any passion of inflaming love,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=I cannot tell; but this I am assured,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=As I am sick with working of my thoughts.
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Agree to any covenants, and procure
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=To cross the seas to England and be crown'd
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=For your expenses and sufficient charge,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Among the people gather up a tenth.
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=And you, good uncle, banish all offence:
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=If you do censure me by what you were,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Not what you are, I know it will excuse
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=This sudden execution of my will.
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=And so, conduct me where, from company,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=I may revolve and ruminate my grief.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.
Notice:Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=With hope to find the like event in love,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=But prosper better than the Trojan did.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=But I will rule both her, the king and realm.
Notice:Exit
