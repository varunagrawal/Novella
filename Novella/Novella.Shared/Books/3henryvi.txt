Dialogue#YORK=Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
Dialogue#YORK=Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,

Dialogue#WARWICK=The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
Dialogue#WARWICK=And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice
Dialogue#WARWICK=Hath made us by-words to our enemies.

Dialogue#EXETER=But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=To make a shambles of the parliament-house!

Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Shall be the war that Henry means to use.

Dialogue#WARWICK=Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;

Dialogue#WARWICK=Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!
Dialogue#YORK=Will you we show our title to the crown?
Dialogue#YORK=If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And seized upon their towns and provinces.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=The lord protector lost it, and not I:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.
Dialogue#RICHARD=You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.
Dialogue#EDWARD=Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.

Dialogue#RICHARD=Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.
Dialogue#YORK=Sons, peace!
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
Dialogue#WARWICK=And be you silent and attentive too,
Dialogue#WARWICK=For he that interrupts him shall not live.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=My title's good, and better far than his.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
Dialogue#YORK='Twas by rebellion against his king.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=[Aside]  I know not what to say; my title's weak.--
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?
Dialogue#YORK=What then?
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=An if he may, then am I lawful king;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=For Richard, in the view of many lords,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Whose heir my father was, and I am his.
Dialogue#YORK=He rose against him, being his sovereign,
Dialogue#YORK=And made him to resign his crown perforce.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?
Dialogue#EXETER=No; for he could not so resign his crown
Dialogue#EXETER=But that the next heir should succeed and reign.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
Dialogue#EXETER=His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
Dialogue#YORK=Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
Dialogue#EXETER=My conscience tells me he is lawful king.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=[Aside]  All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Can set the duke up in despite of me.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:

Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
Notice#Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, CLIFFORD, and WESTMORELAND

Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=But be it as it may: I here entail
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;

Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Who can be patient in such extremes?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And disinherited thine only son.
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=Father, you cannot disinherit me:
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=If you be king, why should not I succeed?
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And given unto the house of York such head
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=What is it, but to make thy sepulchre
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And creep into it far before thy time?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;

Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Before I would have granted to that act.

Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,

Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Whereby my son is disinherited.

Dialogue#RICHARD=The crown of England, father, which is yours.
Dialogue#YORK=Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Your right depends not on his life or death.
Dialogue#EDWARD=Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:
Dialogue#EDWARD=By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
Dialogue#EDWARD=It will outrun you, father, in the end.
Dialogue#YORK=I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
Dialogue#EDWARD=But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:

Dialogue#RICHARD=No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
Dialogue#YORK=I shall be, if I claim by open war.
Dialogue#RICHARD=I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
Dialogue#YORK=Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
Dialogue#RICHARD=An oath is of no moment, being not took
Dialogue#RICHARD=Before a true and lawful magistrate,
Dialogue#RICHARD=That hath authority over him that swears:
Dialogue#RICHARD=Henry had none, but did usurp the place;
Dialogue#RICHARD=Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,
Dialogue#RICHARD=Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think
Dialogue#RICHARD=How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;
Dialogue#RICHARD=Within whose circuit is Elysium
Dialogue#RICHARD=And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest
Dialogue#RICHARD=Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
Dialogue#RICHARD=Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.

Dialogue#YORK=Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
Dialogue#YORK=While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,
Dialogue#YORK=But that I seek occasion how to rise,
Dialogue#YORK=And yet the king not privy to my drift,
Dialogue#YORK=Nor any of the house of Lancaster?

Dialogue#RUTLAND=That trembles under his devouring paws;

Dialogue#RUTLAND=Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
Dialogue#RUTLAND=And not with such a cruel threatening look.
Dialogue#RUTLAND=Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.
Dialogue#RUTLAND=I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:
Dialogue#RUTLAND=Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.
Dialogue#RUTLAND=Then let my father's blood open it again:
Dialogue#RUTLAND=He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Were not revenge sufficient for me;
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=The sight of any of the house of York

Dialogue#CLIFFORD=So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.
Dialogue#YORK=O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
Dialogue#YORK=And in thy thought o'er-run my former time;
Dialogue#YORK=And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,
Dialogue#YORK=And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice
Dialogue#YORK=Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=I will not bandy with thee word for word,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=When he might spurn him with his foot away?
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=It is war's prize to take all vantages;
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=And ten to one is no impeach of valour.
Notice#They lay hands on YORK, who struggles
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=So doth the cony struggle in the net.
Dialogue#YORK=So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
Dialogue#YORK=So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=What would your grace have done unto him now?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=What! was it you that would be England's king?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And made a preachment of your high descent?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And if thine eyes can water for his death,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=I should lament thy miserable state.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
Notice#Putting a paper crown on his head
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And this is he was his adopted heir.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=But how is it that great Plantagenet
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=As I bethink me, you should not be king
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And rob his temples of the diadem,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Now in his life, against your holy oath?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=That is my office, for my father's sake.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.
Dialogue#YORK=She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
Dialogue#YORK=Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
Dialogue#YORK=How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
Dialogue#YORK=To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
Dialogue#YORK=Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
Dialogue#YORK=But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,
Dialogue#YORK=Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
Dialogue#YORK=I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.
Dialogue#YORK=To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,
Dialogue#YORK=Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
Dialogue#YORK=Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
Dialogue#YORK=Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
Dialogue#YORK=Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
Dialogue#YORK=Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
Dialogue#YORK=It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
Dialogue#YORK=Unless the adage must be verified,
Dialogue#YORK=That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
Dialogue#YORK='Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
Dialogue#YORK=But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:
Dialogue#YORK='Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;
Dialogue#YORK=The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:
Dialogue#YORK='Tis government that makes them seem divine;
Dialogue#YORK=The want thereof makes thee abominable:
Dialogue#YORK=Thou art as opposite to every good
Dialogue#YORK=As the Antipodes are unto us,
Dialogue#YORK=Or as the south to the septentrion.
Dialogue#YORK=O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
Dialogue#YORK=How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
Dialogue#YORK=To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
Dialogue#YORK=And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
Dialogue#YORK=Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;
Dialogue#YORK=Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
Dialogue#YORK=Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:
Dialogue#YORK=Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:
Dialogue#YORK=For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
Dialogue#YORK=And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
Dialogue#YORK=These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:
Dialogue#YORK=And every drop cries vengeance for his death,
Dialogue#YORK='Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false
Dialogue#YORK=Frenchwoman.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.
Dialogue#YORK=That face of his the hungry cannibals
Dialogue#YORK=Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:
Dialogue#YORK=But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,
Dialogue#YORK=O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.
Dialogue#YORK=See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:
Dialogue#YORK=This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,
Dialogue#YORK=And I with tears do wash the blood away.
Dialogue#YORK=Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:
Dialogue#YORK=And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,
Dialogue#YORK=Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
Dialogue#YORK=Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,
Dialogue#YORK=And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'
Dialogue#YORK=There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;
Dialogue#YORK=And in thy need such comfort come to thee
Dialogue#YORK=As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
Dialogue#YORK=Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:
Dialogue#YORK=My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=I should not for my life but weep with him.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Think but upon the wrong he did us all,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
Notice#Stabbing him
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
Notice#Stabbing him
Dialogue#YORK=Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
Dialogue#YORK=My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.

Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Off with his head, and set it on York gates;

Banner#ACT II
Banner#SCENE I. A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire.
Notice#A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power
Dialogue#EDWARD=I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Or whether he be 'scaped away or no
Dialogue#EDWARD=From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
Dialogue#EDWARD=Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;
Dialogue#EDWARD=Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
Dialogue#EDWARD=Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
Dialogue#EDWARD=The happy tidings of his good escape.
Dialogue#EDWARD=How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
Dialogue#RICHARD=I cannot joy, until I be resolved
Dialogue#RICHARD=Where our right valiant father is become.
Dialogue#RICHARD=I saw him in the battle range about;
Dialogue#RICHARD=And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
Dialogue#RICHARD=As doth a lion in a herd of neat;
Dialogue#RICHARD=Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,
Dialogue#RICHARD=Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,
Dialogue#RICHARD=The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.
Dialogue#RICHARD=So fared our father with his enemies;
Dialogue#RICHARD=So fled his enemies my warlike father:
Dialogue#RICHARD=Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.
Dialogue#RICHARD=See how the morning opes her golden gates,
Dialogue#RICHARD=And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!
Dialogue#RICHARD=How well resembles it the prime of youth,
Dialogue#RICHARD=Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!
Dialogue#EDWARD=Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
Dialogue#RICHARD=Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
Dialogue#RICHARD=Not separated with the racking clouds,
Dialogue#RICHARD=But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.
Dialogue#RICHARD=See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
Dialogue#RICHARD=As if they vow'd some league inviolable:
Dialogue#RICHARD=Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
Dialogue#RICHARD=In this the heaven figures some event.
Dialogue#EDWARD='Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
Dialogue#EDWARD=I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
Dialogue#EDWARD=That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Each one already blazing by our meeds,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Should notwithstanding join our lights together
Dialogue#EDWARD=And over-shine the earth as this the world.
Dialogue#EDWARD=Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear
Dialogue#EDWARD=Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,
Dialogue#RICHARD=You love the breeder better than the male.
Notice#Enter a Messenger
Dialogue#RICHARD=But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell
Dialogue#RICHARD=Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?
Dialogue#Messenger=Ah, one that was a woful looker-on
Dialogue#Messenger=When as the noble Duke of York was slain,
Dialogue#Messenger=Your princely father and my loving lord!
Dialogue#EDWARD=O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
Dialogue#Messenger=Environed he was with many foes,
Dialogue#Messenger=And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
Dialogue#Messenger=Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
Dialogue#Messenger=But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
Dialogue#Messenger=And many strokes, though with a little axe,
Dialogue#Messenger=Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
Dialogue#Messenger=By many hands your father was subdued;
Dialogue#Messenger=But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
Dialogue#Messenger=Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,
Dialogue#Messenger=Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,
Dialogue#Messenger=Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
Dialogue#Messenger=The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
Dialogue#Messenger=A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
Dialogue#Messenger=Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:
Dialogue#Messenger=And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
Dialogue#Messenger=They took his head, and on the gates of York
Dialogue#Messenger=They set the same; and there it doth remain,
Dialogue#Messenger=The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.
Dialogue#EDWARD=Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
Dialogue#EDWARD=O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain
Dialogue#EDWARD=The flower of Europe for his chivalry;
Dialogue#EDWARD=And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,
Dialogue#EDWARD=For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.
Dialogue#EDWARD=Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
Dialogue#EDWARD=Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
Dialogue#EDWARD=Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
Dialogue#EDWARD=For never henceforth shall I joy again,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Never, O never shall I see more joy!
Dialogue#RICHARD= I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture
Dialogue#RICHARD=Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:
Dialogue#RICHARD=Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;
Dialogue#RICHARD=For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
Dialogue#RICHARD=Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,
Dialogue#RICHARD=And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
Dialogue#RICHARD=To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
Dialogue#RICHARD=Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me
Dialogue#RICHARD=Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,
Dialogue#RICHARD=Or die renowned by attempting it.
Dialogue#EDWARD=His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
Dialogue#EDWARD=His dukedom and his chair with me is left.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
Dialogue#RICHARD=Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:
Dialogue#RICHARD=For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;
Dialogue#RICHARD=Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.
Notice#March. Enter WARWICK, MONTAGUE, and their army
Dialogue#WARWICK=How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?
Dialogue#RICHARD=Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
Dialogue#RICHARD=Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance
Dialogue#RICHARD=Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,
Dialogue#RICHARD=The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
Dialogue#RICHARD=O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!
Dialogue#EDWARD=O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
Dialogue#WARWICK=And now, to add more measure to your woes,
Dialogue#WARWICK=I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
Dialogue#WARWICK=After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
Dialogue#WARWICK=I, then in London keeper of the king,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
Dialogue#WARWICK=And very well appointed, as I thought,
Dialogue#WARWICK=March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Bearing the king in my behalf along;
Dialogue#WARWICK=For by my scouts I was advertised
Dialogue#WARWICK=That she was coming with a full intent
Dialogue#WARWICK=To dash our late decree in parliament
Dialogue#WARWICK=Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met
Dialogue#WARWICK=Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
Dialogue#WARWICK=But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,
Dialogue#WARWICK=That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;
Dialogue#WARWICK=Or whether 'twas report of her success;
Dialogue#WARWICK=Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
Dialogue#WARWICK=I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
Dialogue#WARWICK=Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
Dialogue#WARWICK=I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,
Dialogue#WARWICK=With promise of high pay and great rewards:
Dialogue#WARWICK=But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
Dialogue#WARWICK=And we in them no hope to win the day;
Dialogue#WARWICK=So that we fled; the king unto the queen;
Dialogue#WARWICK=Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,
Dialogue#WARWICK=In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:
Dialogue#WARWICK=For in the marches here we heard you were,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Making another head to fight again.
Dialogue#EDWARD=Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
Dialogue#EDWARD=And when came George from Burgundy to England?
Dialogue#WARWICK=Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
Dialogue#WARWICK=And for your brother, he was lately sent
Dialogue#WARWICK=From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
Dialogue#WARWICK=With aid of soldiers to this needful war.
Dialogue#RICHARD='Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:
Dialogue#RICHARD=Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
Dialogue#RICHARD=But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
Dialogue#WARWICK=For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Dialogue#WARWICK=Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
Dialogue#WARWICK=And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Were he as famous and as bold in war
Dialogue#WARWICK=As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.
Dialogue#RICHARD=I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:
Dialogue#RICHARD='Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
Dialogue#RICHARD=But in this troublous time what's to be done?
Dialogue#RICHARD=Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
Dialogue#RICHARD=And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
Dialogue#RICHARD=Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
Dialogue#RICHARD=Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Dialogue#RICHARD=Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
Dialogue#RICHARD=If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
Dialogue#WARWICK=And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
Dialogue#WARWICK=With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
Dialogue#WARWICK=And of their feather many more proud birds,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
Dialogue#WARWICK=He swore consent to your succession,
Dialogue#WARWICK=His oath enrolled in the parliament;
Dialogue#WARWICK=And now to London all the crew are gone,
Dialogue#WARWICK=To frustrate both his oath and what beside
Dialogue#WARWICK=May make against the house of Lancaster.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:
Dialogue#WARWICK=Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
Dialogue#WARWICK=With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
Dialogue#WARWICK=And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
Dialogue#WARWICK=And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
Dialogue#WARWICK=But never once again turn back and fly.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:
Dialogue#RICHARD=Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,
Dialogue#RICHARD=That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.
Dialogue#EDWARD=Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
Dialogue#EDWARD=And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
Dialogue#EDWARD=Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!
Dialogue#WARWICK=No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:
Dialogue#WARWICK=The next degree is England's royal throne;
Dialogue#WARWICK=For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
Dialogue#WARWICK=In every borough as we pass along;
Dialogue#WARWICK=And he that throws not up his cap for joy
Dialogue#WARWICK=Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
Dialogue#WARWICK=King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
Dialogue#WARWICK=But sound the trumpets, and about our task.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
Dialogue#RICHARD=As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
Dialogue#RICHARD=I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.
Dialogue#EDWARD=Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!

Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:

Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=My gracious liege, this too much lenity
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=And harmful pity must be laid aside.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Not his that spoils her young before her face.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=And raise his issue, like a loving sire;
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Which argued thee a most unloving father.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Were it not pity that this goodly boy
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=And long hereafter say unto his child,
Dialogue#CLIFFORD='What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=My careless father fondly gave away'?
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=And let his manly face, which promiseth

Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?
Dialogue#EDWARD=I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
Dialogue#EDWARD=I was adopted heir by his consent:
Dialogue#EDWARD=Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
Dialogue#EDWARD=You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Have caused him, by new act of parliament,
Dialogue#EDWARD=To blot out me, and put his own son in.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=And reason too:

Dialogue#RICHARD=Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain
Dialogue#RICHARD=The execution of my big-swoln heart
Dialogue#RICHARD=Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?
Dialogue#RICHARD=Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
Dialogue#RICHARD=As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;
Dialogue#RICHARD=But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=I am a king, and privileged to speak.
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
Dialogue#CLIFFORD=Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:
Dialogue#RICHARD=By him that made us all, I am resolved
Dialogue#RICHARD=that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.
Dialogue#EDWARD=Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
Dialogue#EDWARD=A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,
Dialogue#EDWARD=That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.
Dialogue#WARWICK=If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;

Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=If that be right which Warwick says is right,
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=There is no wrong, but every thing is right.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
Dialogue#RICHARD=For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
Dialogue#RICHARD=Whose father bears the title of a king,--
Dialogue#RICHARD=As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--
Dialogue#RICHARD=Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
Dialogue#RICHARD=To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?
Dialogue#EDWARD=A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
Dialogue#EDWARD=To make this shameless callet know herself.
Dialogue#EDWARD=Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
Dialogue#EDWARD=And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
Dialogue#EDWARD=By that false woman, as this king by thee.
Dialogue#EDWARD=His father revell'd in the heart of France,
Dialogue#EDWARD=And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
Dialogue#EDWARD=And had he match'd according to his state,
Dialogue#EDWARD=He might have kept that glory to this day;
Dialogue#EDWARD=But when he took a beggar to his bed,
Dialogue#EDWARD=And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
Dialogue#EDWARD=That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
Dialogue#EDWARD=And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
Dialogue#EDWARD=For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
Dialogue#EDWARD=Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;
Dialogue#EDWARD=And we, in pity of the gentle king,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Had slipp'd our claim until another age.
Dialogue#GEORGE=But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
Dialogue#GEORGE=And that thy summer bred us no increase,
Dialogue#GEORGE=We set the axe to thy usurping root;
Dialogue#GEORGE=And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
Dialogue#GEORGE=Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
Dialogue#GEORGE=We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
Dialogue#GEORGE=Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.
Dialogue#EDWARD=And, in this resolution, I defy thee;
Dialogue#EDWARD=Not willing any longer conference,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
Dialogue#EDWARD=Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
Dialogue#EDWARD=And either victory, or else a grave.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Stay, Edward.
Dialogue#EDWARD=No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:
Dialogue#EDWARD=These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.

Dialogue#RICHARD=Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
Dialogue#RICHARD='Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'
Dialogue#RICHARD=So, underneath the belly of their steeds,
Dialogue#RICHARD=That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
Dialogue#RICHARD=The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:
Dialogue#WARWICK=I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;
Dialogue#WARWICK=And look upon, as if the tragedy
Dialogue#WARWICK=Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?
Dialogue#WARWICK=Here on my knee I vow to God above,
Dialogue#WARWICK=I'll never pause again, never stand still,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
Dialogue#WARWICK=Or fortune given me measure of revenge.

Dialogue#EDWARD=Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
Dialogue#EDWARD=That to my foes this body must be prey,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,
Dialogue#EDWARD=And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!

Dialogue#EDWARD=Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
Dialogue#RICHARD=Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:

Dialogue#RICHARD=That winter should cut off our spring-time so.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell.

Dialogue#WARWICK=And now to London with triumphant march,
Dialogue#WARWICK=There to be crowned England's royal king:
Dialogue#WARWICK=From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,

Dialogue#WARWICK=So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;
Dialogue#WARWICK=And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread
Dialogue#WARWICK=The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;

Dialogue#WARWICK=First will I see the coronation;
Dialogue#WARWICK=And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,
Dialogue#WARWICK=To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.
Dialogue#EDWARD=Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
Dialogue#EDWARD=For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,
Dialogue#EDWARD=And never will I undertake the thing
Dialogue#EDWARD=Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.
Dialogue#EDWARD=Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,
Dialogue#EDWARD=And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,
Dialogue#EDWARD=Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.
Dialogue#RICHARD=Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;

Dialogue#Second Keeper=I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
Dialogue#First Keeper=That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
Dialogue#First Keeper=Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.

Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=No humble suitors press to speak for right,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=No, not a man comes for redress of thee;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=For how can I help them, and not myself?

Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=To wife for Edward: if this news be true,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=For Warwick is a subtle orator,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=By this account then Margaret may win him;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=For she's a woman to be pitied much:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And Nero will be tainted with remorse,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And in conclusion wins the king from her,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=With promise of his sister, and what else,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=To strengthen and support King Edward's place.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!
Dialogue#Second Keeper=Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=A man at least, for less I should not be;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And men may talk of kings, and why not I?
Dialogue#Second Keeper=Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.
Dialogue#Second Keeper=But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
Dialogue#Second Keeper=Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
Dialogue#Second Keeper=Your crown content and you must be contented
Dialogue#Second Keeper=To go along with us; for as we think,
Dialogue#Second Keeper=You are the king King Edward hath deposed;
Dialogue#Second Keeper=And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
Dialogue#Second Keeper=Will apprehend you as his enemy.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=But did you never swear, and break an oath?
Dialogue#Second Keeper=No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
Dialogue#Second Keeper=Here in this country, where we now remain.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=I was anointed king at nine months old;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=My father and my grandfather were kings,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
Dialogue#First Keeper=No;
Dialogue#First Keeper=For we were subjects but while you were king.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And as the air blows it to me again,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And yielding to another when it blows,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Commanded always by the greater gust;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Such is the lightness of you common men.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.
Dialogue#First Keeper=We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=So would you be again to Henry,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=If he were seated as King Edward is.
Dialogue#First Keeper=We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,
Dialogue#First Keeper=To go with us unto the officers.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And what God will, that let your king perform;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And what he will, I humbly yield unto.

Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Which we in justice cannot well deny,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Because in quarrel of the house of York
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=The worthy gentleman did lose his life.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=It were dishonour to deny it her.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=[Aside to CLARENCE]  Yea, is it so?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I see the lady hath a thing to grant,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Before the king will grant her humble suit.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He knows the game: how true
Dialogue#CLARENCE=he keeps the wind!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=[Aside to CLARENCE]  Silence!
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Widow, we will consider of your suit;
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=And come some other time to know our mind.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
Dialogue#LADY GREY=May it please your highness to resolve me now;
Dialogue#LADY GREY=And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, widow? then I'll warrant
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=you all your lands,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I fear her not, unless she
Dialogue#CLARENCE=chance to fall.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=[Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that! for he'll
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=take vantages.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I think he means to beg a
Dialogue#CLARENCE=child of her.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=[Aside to CLARENCE]  Nay, whip me then: he'll rather
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=give her two.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=Three, my most gracious lord.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=[Aside to CLARENCE]  You shall have four, if you'll
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=be ruled by him.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV='Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, good leave have you; for
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=you will have leave,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.
Notice#GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
Dialogue#LADY GREY=Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=And would you not do much to do them good?
Dialogue#LADY GREY=To do them good, I would sustain some harm.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=Therefore I came unto your majesty.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=So shall you bind me to your highness' service.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?
Dialogue#LADY GREY=What you command, that rests in me to do.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=But you will take exceptions to my boon.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=Why, then I will do what your grace commands.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=[Aside to CLARENCE]  He plies her hard; and much rain
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=wears the marble.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  As red as fire! nay, then
Dialogue#CLARENCE=her wax must melt.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=[Aside to CLARENCE]  The match is made; she seals it
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=with a curtsy.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?
Dialogue#LADY GREY=My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
Dialogue#LADY GREY=That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=But now you partly may perceive my mind.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=My mind will never grant what I perceive
Dialogue#LADY GREY=Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
Dialogue#LADY GREY=For by that loss I will not purchase them.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
Dialogue#LADY GREY=Accords not with the sadness of my suit:
Dialogue#LADY GREY=Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=[Aside to CLARENCE]  The widow likes him not, she
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=knits her brows.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He is the bluntest wooer in
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Christendom.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=[Aside]  Her looks do argue her replete with modesty;
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Her words do show her wit incomparable;
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=All her perfections challenge sovereignty:
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=One way or other, she is for a king;
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=And she shall be my love, or else my queen.--
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?
Dialogue#LADY GREY='Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:
Dialogue#LADY GREY=I am a subject fit to jest withal,
Dialogue#LADY GREY=But far unfit to be a sovereign.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=I speak no more than what my soul intends;
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.
Dialogue#LADY GREY=And that is more than I will yield unto:
Dialogue#LADY GREY=I know I am too mean to be your queen,
Dialogue#LADY GREY=And yet too good to be your concubine.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.
Dialogue#LADY GREY='Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=To be the father unto many sons.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=[Aside to CLARENCE]  The ghostly father now hath done
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=his shrift.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  When he was made a shriver,
Dialogue#CLARENCE='twas for shift.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=You'll think it strange if I should marry her.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=To whom, my lord?
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=                  Why, Clarence, to myself.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=By so much is the wonder in extremes.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.
Notice#Enter a Nobleman
Dialogue#Nobleman=My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
Dialogue#Nobleman=And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=To question of his apprehension.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.
Notice#Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To cross me from the golden time I look for!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And yet, between my soul's desire and me--
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The lustful Edward's title buried--
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=A cold premeditation for my purpose!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Like one that stands upon a promontory,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=So do I wish the crown, being so far off;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Flattering me with impossibilities.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=What other pleasure can the world afford?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And deck my body in gay ornaments,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=O miserable thought! and more unlikely
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Why, love forswore me in my  mother's womb:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To make an envious mountain on my back,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Where sits deformity to mock my body;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To shape my legs of an unequal size;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To disproportion me in every part,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That carries no impression like the dam.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And am I then a man to be beloved?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=As are of better person than myself,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And yet I know not how to get the crown,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=For many lives stand between me and home:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Seeking a way and straying from the way;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Not knowing how to find the open air,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But toiling desperately to find it out,--
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Torment myself to catch the English crown:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And from that torment I will free myself,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And frame my face to all occasions.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I can add colours to the chameleon,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.

Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=No, mighty King of France: now Margaret
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=But now mischance hath trod my title down,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And with dishonour laid me on the ground;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And to my humble seat conform myself.
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=And sit thee by our side:
Notice#Seats her by him
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Yield not thy neck
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Is of a king become a banish'd man,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Usurps the regal title and the seat
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Our people and our peers are both misled,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=While we bethink a means to break it off.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.

Dialogue#WARWICK=From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
Dialogue#WARWICK=My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,
Dialogue#WARWICK=I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
Dialogue#WARWICK=First, to do greetings to thy royal person;
Dialogue#WARWICK=And then to crave a league of amity;
Dialogue#WARWICK=And lastly, to confirm that amity
Dialogue#WARWICK=With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
Dialogue#WARWICK=That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
Dialogue#WARWICK=To England's king in lawful marriage.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=[Aside]  If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.
Dialogue#WARWICK=[To BONA]  And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,
Dialogue#WARWICK=I am commanded, with your leave and favour,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue
Dialogue#WARWICK=To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;
Dialogue#WARWICK=Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Before you answer Warwick. His demand
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=But from deceit bred by necessity;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=For how can tyrants safely govern home,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Injurious Margaret!
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=And why not queen?
Dialogue#WARWICK=Because thy father Henry did usurp;
Dialogue#WARWICK=And thou no more are prince than she is queen.
Dialogue#OXFORD=Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
Dialogue#OXFORD=Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
Dialogue#OXFORD=And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
Dialogue#OXFORD=Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
Dialogue#OXFORD=And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
Dialogue#OXFORD=Who by his prowess conquered all France:
Dialogue#OXFORD=From these our Henry lineally descends.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
Dialogue#WARWICK=You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
Dialogue#WARWICK=All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
Dialogue#WARWICK=Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
Dialogue#WARWICK=But for the rest, you tell a pedigree
Dialogue#WARWICK=Of threescore and two years; a silly time
Dialogue#WARWICK=To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.
Dialogue#OXFORD=Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
Dialogue#OXFORD=Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
Dialogue#OXFORD=And not bewray thy treason with a blush?
Dialogue#WARWICK=Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
Dialogue#WARWICK=For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.
Dialogue#OXFORD=Call him my king by whose injurious doom
Dialogue#OXFORD=My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
Dialogue#OXFORD=Was done to death? and more than so, my father,
Dialogue#OXFORD=Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
Dialogue#OXFORD=When nature brought him to the door of death?
Dialogue#OXFORD=No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
Dialogue#OXFORD=This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.
Dialogue#WARWICK=And I the house of York.
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=While I use further conference with Warwick.
Notice#They stand aloof
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=But is he gracious in the people's eye?
Dialogue#WARWICK=The more that Henry was unfortunate.
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Then further, all dissembling set aside,
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Tell me for truth the measure of his love
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Unto our sister Bona.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Such it seems
Dialogue#WARWICK=As may beseem a monarch like himself.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Myself have often heard him say and swear
Dialogue#WARWICK=That this his love was an eternal plant,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
Dialogue#WARWICK=The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
Dialogue#BONA=Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:
Notice#To WARWICK
Dialogue#BONA=Yet I confess that often ere this day,
Dialogue#BONA=When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
Dialogue#BONA=Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Touching the jointure that your king must make,
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=To Edward, but not to the English king.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=By this alliance to make void my suit:
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=And still is friend to him and Margaret:
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=But if your title to the crown be weak,
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=As may appear by Edward's good success,
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Then 'tis but reason that I be released
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=From giving aid which late I promised.
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=That your estate requires and mine can yield.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
Dialogue#WARWICK=And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
Dialogue#WARWICK=You have a father able to maintain you;
Dialogue#WARWICK=And better 'twere you troubled him than France.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.

Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
Dialogue#KING LEWIS XI=Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=I told your majesty as much before:
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.
Dialogue#WARWICK=King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
Dialogue#WARWICK=And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
Dialogue#WARWICK=That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,
Dialogue#WARWICK=No more my king, for he dishonours me,

Dialogue#WARWICK=Had he none else to make a stale but me?
Dialogue#WARWICK=Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
Dialogue#WARWICK=I was the chief that raised him to the crown,

Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Think'st thou I am an executioner?
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=If murdering innocents be executing,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Why, then thou art an executioner.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,

Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VI=To signify thou camest to bite the world:

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER='O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And so I was; which plainly signified
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I have no brother, I am like no brother;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Be resident in men like one another
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And not in me: I am myself alone.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=For I will buz abroad such prophecies
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
