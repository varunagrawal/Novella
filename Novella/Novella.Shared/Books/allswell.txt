Banner#SCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
Notice#Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black
Dialogue#COUNTESS=In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
Dialogue#BERTRAM=anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
Dialogue#BERTRAM=whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
Dialogue#LAFEU=You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
Dialogue#LAFEU=sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
Dialogue#LAFEU=good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
Dialogue#LAFEU=worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
Dialogue#LAFEU=than lack it where there is such abundance.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
Dialogue#LAFEU=He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
Dialogue#LAFEU=practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
Dialogue#LAFEU=finds no other advantage in the process but only the
Dialogue#LAFEU=losing of hope by time.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
Dialogue#COUNTESS='had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
Dialogue#COUNTESS=almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
Dialogue#COUNTESS=far, would have made nature immortal, and death
Dialogue#COUNTESS=should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
Dialogue#COUNTESS=king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
Dialogue#COUNTESS=the death of the king's disease.
Dialogue#LAFEU=How called you the man you speak of, madam?
Dialogue#COUNTESS=He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
Dialogue#COUNTESS=his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
Dialogue#LAFEU=He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
Dialogue#LAFEU=lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
Dialogue#LAFEU=was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
Dialogue#LAFEU=could be set up against mortality.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?
Dialogue#LAFEU=A fistula, my lord.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I heard not of it before.
Dialogue#LAFEU=I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
Dialogue#LAFEU=the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
Dialogue#COUNTESS=His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
Dialogue#COUNTESS=overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
Dialogue#COUNTESS=her education promises; her dispositions she
Dialogue#COUNTESS=inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
Dialogue#COUNTESS=an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
Dialogue#COUNTESS=commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
Dialogue#COUNTESS=traitors too; in her they are the better for their
Dialogue#COUNTESS=simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
Dialogue#LAFEU=Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
Dialogue#COUNTESS='Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
Dialogue#COUNTESS=in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
Dialogue#COUNTESS=her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
Dialogue#COUNTESS=livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
Dialogue#COUNTESS=go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
Dialogue#COUNTESS=a sorrow than have it.
Dialogue#HELENA=I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
Dialogue#LAFEU=Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
Dialogue#LAFEU=excessive grief the enemy to the living.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
Dialogue#COUNTESS=makes it soon mortal.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
Dialogue#LAFEU=How understand we that?
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
Dialogue#COUNTESS=In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
Dialogue#COUNTESS='Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Advise him.
Dialogue#LAFEU=          He cannot want the best
Dialogue#LAFEU=That shall attend his love.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.

Dialogue#HELENA=O, were that all! I think not on my father;
Dialogue#HELENA=And these great tears grace his remembrance more
Dialogue#HELENA=Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
Dialogue#HELENA=I have forgot him: my imagination
Dialogue#HELENA=Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
Dialogue#HELENA=I am undone: there is no living, none,
Dialogue#HELENA=If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
Dialogue#HELENA=That I should love a bright particular star
Dialogue#HELENA=And think to wed it, he is so above me:
Dialogue#HELENA=In his bright radiance and collateral light
Dialogue#HELENA=Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
Dialogue#HELENA=The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
Dialogue#HELENA=The hind that would be mated by the lion
Dialogue#HELENA=Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
Dialogue#HELENA=To see him every hour; to sit and draw
Dialogue#HELENA=His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
Dialogue#HELENA=In our heart's table; heart too capable
Dialogue#HELENA=Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
Dialogue#HELENA=But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
Dialogue#HELENA=Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?
Notice#Enter PAROLLES
Notice#Aside
Dialogue#HELENA=One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
Dialogue#HELENA=And yet I know him a notorious liar,
Dialogue#HELENA=Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
Dialogue#HELENA=Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,
Dialogue#HELENA=That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
Dialogue#HELENA=Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
Dialogue#HELENA=Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Save you, fair queen!
Dialogue#HELENA=And you, monarch!
Dialogue#PAROLLES=No.
Dialogue#HELENA=And no.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Are you meditating on virginity?
Dialogue#HELENA=Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
Dialogue#HELENA=ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how
Dialogue#HELENA=may we barricado it against him?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Keep him out.
Dialogue#HELENA=But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,
Dialogue#HELENA=in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
Dialogue#HELENA=warlike resistance.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
Dialogue#PAROLLES=undermine you and blow you up.
Dialogue#HELENA=Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
Dialogue#HELENA=blowers up! Is there no military policy, how
Dialogue#HELENA=virgins might blow up men?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
Dialogue#PAROLLES=blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
Dialogue#PAROLLES=the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
Dialogue#PAROLLES=is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
Dialogue#PAROLLES=preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
Dialogue#PAROLLES=increase and there was never virgin got till
Dialogue#PAROLLES=virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
Dialogue#PAROLLES=metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
Dialogue#PAROLLES=may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
Dialogue#PAROLLES=ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!
Dialogue#HELENA=I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the
Dialogue#PAROLLES=rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
Dialogue#PAROLLES=is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
Dialogue#PAROLLES=disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
Dialogue#PAROLLES=virginity murders itself and should be buried in
Dialogue#PAROLLES=highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
Dialogue#PAROLLES=offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
Dialogue#PAROLLES=much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very
Dialogue#PAROLLES=paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
Dialogue#PAROLLES=self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
Dialogue#PAROLLES=canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
Dialogue#PAROLLES=by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
Dialogue#PAROLLES=itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the
Dialogue#PAROLLES=principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!
Dialogue#HELENA=How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it
Dialogue#PAROLLES=likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
Dialogue#PAROLLES=lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't
Dialogue#PAROLLES=while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
Dialogue#PAROLLES=of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
Dialogue#PAROLLES=like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
Dialogue#PAROLLES=now. Your date is better in your pie and your
Dialogue#PAROLLES=porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,
Dialogue#PAROLLES=your old virginity, is like one of our French
Dialogue#PAROLLES=withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
Dialogue#PAROLLES='tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;
Dialogue#PAROLLES=marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?
Dialogue#HELENA=Not my virginity yet [         ]
Dialogue#HELENA=There shall your master have a thousand loves,
Dialogue#HELENA=A mother and a mistress and a friend,
Dialogue#HELENA=A phoenix, captain and an enemy,
Dialogue#HELENA=A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
Dialogue#HELENA=A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
Dialogue#HELENA=His humble ambition, proud humility,
Dialogue#HELENA=His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
Dialogue#HELENA=His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
Dialogue#HELENA=Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
Dialogue#HELENA=That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--
Dialogue#HELENA=I know not what he shall. God send him well!
Dialogue#HELENA=The court's a learning place, and he is one--
Dialogue#PAROLLES=What one, i' faith?
Dialogue#HELENA=That I wish well. 'Tis pity--
Dialogue#PAROLLES=What's pity?
Dialogue#HELENA=That wishing well had not a body in't,
Dialogue#HELENA=Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
Dialogue#HELENA=Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
Dialogue#HELENA=Might with effects of them follow our friends,
Dialogue#HELENA=And show what we alone must think, which never
Dialogue#HELENA=Return us thanks.

Dialogue#HELENA=I especially think, under Mars.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Why under Mars?
Dialogue#HELENA=The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
Dialogue#HELENA=be born under Mars.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=When he was predominant.
Dialogue#HELENA=When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Why think you so?
Dialogue#HELENA=You go so much backward when you fight.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=That's for advantage.
Dialogue#HELENA=So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;

Dialogue#HELENA=in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.

Dialogue#KING=Into the service of the time and was

Dialogue#KING=His equal had awaked them, and his honour,
Dialogue#KING=Clock to itself, knew the true minute when

Dialogue#KING=He used as creatures of another place
Dialogue#KING=And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,

Dialogue#HELENA=Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,
Dialogue#HELENA=I care no more for than I do for heaven,
Dialogue#HELENA=So I were not his sister. Can't no other,
Dialogue#HELENA=But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:
Dialogue#COUNTESS=God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother
Dialogue#COUNTESS=So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
Dialogue#COUNTESS=My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see
Dialogue#COUNTESS=The mystery of your loneliness, and find
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
Dialogue#COUNTESS=You love my son; invention is ashamed,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Against the proclamation of thy passion,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;
Dialogue#COUNTESS=But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
Dialogue#COUNTESS=See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
Dialogue#COUNTESS=That in their kind they speak it: only sin
Dialogue#COUNTESS=And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
Dialogue#COUNTESS=If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
Dialogue#COUNTESS=If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Tell me truly.
Dialogue#HELENA=                  Good madam, pardon me!
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Do you love my son?
Dialogue#HELENA=Your pardon, noble mistress!
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Love you my son?
Dialogue#HELENA=                  Do not you love him, madam?
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose
Dialogue#COUNTESS=The state of your affection; for your passions
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Have to the full appeach'd.
Dialogue#HELENA=Then, I confess,
Dialogue#HELENA=Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
Dialogue#HELENA=That before you, and next unto high heaven,
Dialogue#HELENA=I love your son.
Dialogue#HELENA=My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:
Dialogue#HELENA=Be not offended; for it hurts not him
Dialogue#HELENA=That he is loved of me: I follow him not
Dialogue#HELENA=By any token of presumptuous suit;
Dialogue#HELENA=Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
Dialogue#HELENA=Yet never know how that desert should be.
Dialogue#HELENA=I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
Dialogue#HELENA=Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
Dialogue#HELENA=I still pour in the waters of my love
Dialogue#HELENA=And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,
Dialogue#HELENA=Religious in mine error, I adore
Dialogue#HELENA=The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,
Dialogue#HELENA=But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
Dialogue#HELENA=Let not your hate encounter with my love
Dialogue#HELENA=For loving where you do: but if yourself,
Dialogue#HELENA=Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
Dialogue#HELENA=Did ever in so true a flame of liking
Dialogue#HELENA=Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
Dialogue#HELENA=Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity
Dialogue#HELENA=To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
Dialogue#HELENA=But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
Dialogue#HELENA=That seeks not to find that her search implies,
Dialogue#HELENA=But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--
Dialogue#COUNTESS=To go to Paris?
Dialogue#HELENA=                  Madam, I had.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Wherefore? tell true.
Dialogue#HELENA=I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
Dialogue#HELENA=You know my father left me some prescriptions
Dialogue#HELENA=Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading
Dialogue#HELENA=And manifest experience had collected
Dialogue#HELENA=For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
Dialogue#HELENA=In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
Dialogue#HELENA=As notes whose faculties inclusive were
Dialogue#HELENA=More than they were in note: amongst the rest,
Dialogue#HELENA=There is a remedy, approved, set down,
Dialogue#HELENA=To cure the desperate languishings whereof
Dialogue#HELENA=The king is render'd lost.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=This was your motive
Dialogue#COUNTESS=For Paris, was it? speak.
Dialogue#HELENA=My lord your son made me to think of this;
Dialogue#HELENA=Else Paris and the medicine and the king
Dialogue#HELENA=Had from the conversation of my thoughts
Dialogue#HELENA=Haply been absent then.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=But think you, Helen,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=If you should tender your supposed aid,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=He would receive it? he and his physicians
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit
Dialogue#COUNTESS=A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
Dialogue#COUNTESS=The danger to itself?
Dialogue#HELENA=There's something in't,
Dialogue#HELENA=More than my father's skill, which was the greatest
Dialogue#HELENA=Of his profession, that his good receipt
Dialogue#HELENA=Shall for my legacy be sanctified
Dialogue#HELENA=By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour
Dialogue#HELENA=But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture
Dialogue#HELENA=The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure
Dialogue#HELENA=By such a day and hour.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Dost thou believe't?
Dialogue#HELENA=Ay, madam, knowingly.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Means and attendants and my loving greetings
Dialogue#COUNTESS=To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home
Dialogue#COUNTESS=And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.

Dialogue#KING=Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--

Dialogue#KING=That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!
Dialogue#KING=Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:

Dialogue#First Lord=There's honour in the theft.

Dialogue#Second Lord=I am your accessary; and so, farewell.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.
Dialogue#First Lord=Farewell, captain.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Sweet Monsieur Parolles!

Dialogue#LAFEU=I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,
Dialogue#LAFEU=And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
Dialogue#KING=I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
Dialogue#KING=And ask'd thee mercy for't.
Dialogue#LAFEU=Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;
Dialogue#LAFEU=Will you be cured of your infirmity?
Dialogue#KING=No.
Dialogue#LAFEU=O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
Dialogue#LAFEU=Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if
Dialogue#LAFEU=My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine
Dialogue#LAFEU=That's able to breathe life into a stone,
Dialogue#LAFEU=Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
Dialogue#LAFEU=With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,
Dialogue#LAFEU=Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
Dialogue#LAFEU=To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,
Dialogue#LAFEU=And write to her a love-line.
Dialogue#KING=What 'her' is this?
Dialogue#LAFEU=Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,
Dialogue#LAFEU=If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,
Dialogue#LAFEU=If seriously I may convey my thoughts
Dialogue#LAFEU=In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
Dialogue#LAFEU=With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,
Dialogue#LAFEU=Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more
Dialogue#LAFEU=Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her
Dialogue#LAFEU=For that is her demand, and know her business?
Dialogue#LAFEU=That done, laugh well at me.
Dialogue#KING=Now, good Lafeu,

Dialogue#LAFEU=Nay, come your ways:

Notice#Exit
Dialogue#KING=Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
Dialogue#HELENA=Ay, my good lord.
Dialogue#HELENA=Gerard de Narbon was my father;
Dialogue#HELENA=In what he did profess, well found.
Dialogue#KING=I knew him.
Dialogue#HELENA=The rather will I spare my praises towards him:
Dialogue#HELENA=Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
Dialogue#HELENA=Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.
Dialogue#HELENA=Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,
Dialogue#HELENA=And of his old experience the oily darling,
Dialogue#HELENA=He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
Dialogue#HELENA=Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;
Dialogue#HELENA=And hearing your high majesty is touch'd
Dialogue#HELENA=With that malignant cause wherein the honour
Dialogue#HELENA=Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
Dialogue#HELENA=I come to tender it and my appliance
Dialogue#HELENA=With all bound humbleness.
Dialogue#KING=We thank you, maiden;
Dialogue#KING=But may not be so credulous of cure,
Dialogue#KING=When our most learned doctors leave us and
Dialogue#KING=The congregated college have concluded
Dialogue#KING=That labouring art can never ransom nature
Dialogue#KING=From her inaidible estate; I say we must not
Dialogue#KING=So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
Dialogue#KING=To prostitute our past-cure malady
Dialogue#KING=To empirics, or to dissever so
Dialogue#KING=Our great self and our credit, to esteem
Dialogue#KING=A senseless help when help past sense we deem.
Dialogue#HELENA=My duty then shall pay me for my pains:
Dialogue#HELENA=I will no more enforce mine office on you.
Dialogue#HELENA=Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
Dialogue#HELENA=A modest one, to bear me back again.
Dialogue#KING=I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:
Dialogue#KING=Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
Dialogue#KING=As one near death to those that wish him live:
Dialogue#KING=But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,
Dialogue#KING=I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
Dialogue#HELENA=What I can do can do no hurt to try,
Dialogue#HELENA=Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
Dialogue#HELENA=He that of greatest works is finisher
Dialogue#HELENA=Oft does them by the weakest minister:
Dialogue#HELENA=So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
Dialogue#HELENA=When judges have been babes; great floods have flown
Dialogue#HELENA=From simple sources, and great seas have dried
Dialogue#HELENA=When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
Dialogue#HELENA=Oft expectation fails and most oft there
Dialogue#HELENA=Where most it promises, and oft it hits
Dialogue#HELENA=Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.
Dialogue#KING=I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;
Dialogue#KING=Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:
Dialogue#KING=Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
Dialogue#HELENA=Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:
Dialogue#HELENA=It is not so with Him that all things knows
Dialogue#HELENA=As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
Dialogue#HELENA=But most it is presumption in us when
Dialogue#HELENA=The help of heaven we count the act of men.
Dialogue#HELENA=Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
Dialogue#HELENA=Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
Dialogue#HELENA=I am not an impostor that proclaim
Dialogue#HELENA=Myself against the level of mine aim;
Dialogue#HELENA=But know I think and think I know most sure
Dialogue#HELENA=My art is not past power nor you past cure.
Dialogue#KING=Are thou so confident? within what space
Dialogue#KING=Hopest thou my cure?
Dialogue#HELENA=The great'st grace lending grace
Dialogue#HELENA=Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
Dialogue#HELENA=Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
Dialogue#HELENA=Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
Dialogue#HELENA=Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
Dialogue#HELENA=Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
Dialogue#HELENA=Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
Dialogue#HELENA=What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
Dialogue#HELENA=Health shall live free and sickness freely die.
Dialogue#KING=Upon thy certainty and confidence
Dialogue#KING=What darest thou venture?
Dialogue#HELENA=Tax of impudence,
Dialogue#HELENA=A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame
Dialogue#HELENA=Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name
Dialogue#HELENA=Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse--if worse--extended
Dialogue#HELENA=With vilest torture let my life be ended.
Dialogue#KING=Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
Dialogue#KING=His powerful sound within an organ weak:
Dialogue#KING=And what impossibility would slay
Dialogue#KING=In common sense, sense saves another way.
Dialogue#KING=Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
Dialogue#KING=Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,

Dialogue#KING=Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
Dialogue#KING=Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
Dialogue#KING=Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
Dialogue#KING=That ministers thine own death if I die.
Dialogue#HELENA=If I break time, or flinch in property
Dialogue#HELENA=Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,
Dialogue#HELENA=And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;
Dialogue#HELENA=But, if I help, what do you promise me?
Dialogue#KING=Make thy demand.
Dialogue#HELENA=                  But will you make it even?
Dialogue#KING=Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.
Dialogue#HELENA=Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
Dialogue#HELENA=What husband in thy power I will command:
Dialogue#HELENA=Exempted be from me the arrogance
Dialogue#HELENA=To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
Dialogue#HELENA=My low and humble name to propagate
Dialogue#HELENA=With any branch or image of thy state;
Dialogue#HELENA=But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
Dialogue#HELENA=Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
Dialogue#KING=Here is my hand; the premises observed,
Dialogue#KING=Thy will by my performance shall be served:
Dialogue#KING=So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
Dialogue#KING=Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.
Dialogue#KING=More should I question thee, and more I must,
Dialogue#KING=Though more to know could not be more to trust,
Dialogue#KING=From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest

Dialogue#COUNTESS=when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!
Dialogue#Clown=Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he
Dialogue#Clown=may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make

Dialogue#COUNTESS=Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all
Dialogue#COUNTESS=questions?
Dialogue#Clown=From below your duke to beneath your constable, it
Dialogue#Clown=will fit any question.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=It must be an answer of most monstrous size that

Dialogue#First Lord=And grant it.
Dialogue#HELENA=                  Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
Dialogue#LAFEU=I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace
Dialogue#LAFEU=for my life.
Dialogue#HELENA=The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
Dialogue#HELENA=Before I speak, too threateningly replies:
Dialogue#HELENA=Love make your fortunes twenty times above
Dialogue#HELENA=Her that so wishes and her humble love!
Dialogue#Second Lord=No better, if you please.
Dialogue#HELENA=My wish receive,
Dialogue#HELENA=Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.
Dialogue#LAFEU=Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,
Dialogue#LAFEU=I'd have them whipped; or I would send them to the
Dialogue#LAFEU=Turk, to make eunuchs of.

Dialogue#HELENA=I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:
Dialogue#HELENA=Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed
Dialogue#HELENA=Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
Dialogue#LAFEU=These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her:
Dialogue#LAFEU=sure, they are bastards to the English; the French
Dialogue#LAFEU=ne'er got 'em.
Dialogue#HELENA=You are too young, too happy, and too good,
Dialogue#HELENA=To make yourself a son out of my blood.
Dialogue#Fourth Lord=Fair one, I think not so.
Dialogue#LAFEU=There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk

Dialogue#BERTRAM=My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,

Dialogue#KING=Know'st thou not, Bertram,
Dialogue#KING=What she has done for me?
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Yes, my good lord;

Dialogue#KING=Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
Dialogue#BERTRAM=She had her breeding at my father's charge.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Rather corrupt me ever!
Dialogue#KING='Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
Dialogue#KING=I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
Dialogue#KING=Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
Dialogue#KING=Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
Dialogue#KING=In differences so mighty. If she be
Dialogue#KING=All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,
Dialogue#KING=A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest
Dialogue#KING=Of virtue for the name: but do not so:
Dialogue#KING=From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
Dialogue#KING=The place is dignified by the doer's deed:
Dialogue#KING=Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
Dialogue#KING=It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
Dialogue#KING=Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
Dialogue#KING=The property by what it is should go,
Dialogue#KING=Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
Dialogue#KING=In these to nature she's immediate heir,
Dialogue#KING=And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,
Dialogue#KING=Which challenges itself as honour's born
Dialogue#KING=And is not like the sire: honours thrive,
Dialogue#KING=When rather from our acts we them derive
Dialogue#KING=Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave
Dialogue#KING=Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave
Dialogue#KING=A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
Dialogue#KING=Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
Dialogue#KING=Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
Dialogue#KING=If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
Dialogue#KING=I can create the rest: virtue and she
Dialogue#KING=Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.
Dialogue#KING=Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
Dialogue#HELENA=That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:
Dialogue#HELENA=Let the rest go.
Dialogue#KING=My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
Dialogue#KING=I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
Dialogue#KING=Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
Dialogue#KING=That dost in vile misprision shackle up
Dialogue#KING=My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
Dialogue#KING=We, poising us in her defective scale,
Dialogue#KING=Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,
Dialogue#KING=It is in us to plant thine honour where
Dialogue#KING=We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:
Dialogue#KING=Obey our will, which travails in thy good:
Dialogue#KING=Believe not thy disdain, but presently
Dialogue#KING=Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
Dialogue#KING=Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
Dialogue#KING=Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
Dialogue#KING=Into the staggers and the careless lapse
Dialogue#KING=Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
Dialogue#KING=Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
Dialogue#KING=Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
Dialogue#BERTRAM=My fancy to your eyes: when I consider
Dialogue#BERTRAM=What great creation and what dole of honour
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
Dialogue#BERTRAM=The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Is as 'twere born so.
Dialogue#KING=Take her by the hand,
Dialogue#KING=And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
Dialogue#KING=A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
Dialogue#KING=A balance more replete.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I take her hand.
Dialogue#KING=Good fortune and the favour of the king
Dialogue#KING=Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
Dialogue#KING=Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
Dialogue#KING=And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast
Dialogue#KING=Shall more attend upon the coming space,
Dialogue#KING=Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,

Dialogue#LAFEU=I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty
Dialogue#LAFEU=wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
Dialogue#LAFEU=travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the
Dialogue#LAFEU=bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
Dialogue#LAFEU=believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I

Dialogue#LAFEU=bate thee a scruple.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Well, I shall be wiser.
Dialogue#LAFEU=Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at
Dialogue#LAFEU=a smack o' the contrary. If ever thou be'st bound
Dialogue#LAFEU=in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is
Dialogue#LAFEU=to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold
Dialogue#LAFEU=my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,
Dialogue#LAFEU=that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.

Dialogue#LAFEU=Who? God?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Ay, sir.
Dialogue#LAFEU=The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou
Dialogue#LAFEU=garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of
Dialogue#LAFEU=sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set
Dialogue#LAFEU=thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine
Dialogue#LAFEU=honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat
Dialogue#LAFEU=thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and
Dialogue#LAFEU=every man should beat thee: I think thou wast
Dialogue#LAFEU=created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
Dialogue#LAFEU=Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a
Dialogue#LAFEU=kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and
Dialogue#LAFEU=no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords

Dialogue#HELENA=With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere

Dialogue#BERTRAM=Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
Dialogue#Second Lord=Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
Dialogue#Second Lord=without any malice, but to speak of him as my
Dialogue#Second Lord=kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and
Dialogue#Second Lord=endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner
Dialogue#Second Lord=of no one good quality worthy your lordship's
Dialogue#Second Lord=entertainment.
Dialogue#First Lord=It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in
Dialogue#First Lord=his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some
Dialogue#First Lord=great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
Dialogue#First Lord=None better than to let him fetch off his drum,
Dialogue#First Lord=which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
Dialogue#Second Lord=I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly
Dialogue#Second Lord=surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he
Dialogue#Second Lord=knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink
Dialogue#Second Lord=him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he
Dialogue#Second Lord=is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when
Dialogue#Second Lord=we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship
Dialogue#Second Lord=present at his examination: if he do not, for the

Dialogue#Second Lord=[Aside to BERTRAM]  O, for the love of laughter,

Dialogue#BERTRAM=How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your
Dialogue#BERTRAM=disposition.
Dialogue#First Lord=A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.
Dialogue#PAROLLES='But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!
Dialogue#PAROLLES=There was excellent command,--to charge in with our
Dialogue#PAROLLES=horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
Dialogue#First Lord=That was not to be blamed in the command of the
Dialogue#First Lord=service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar
Dialogue#First Lord=himself could not have prevented, if he had been
Dialogue#First Lord=there to command.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some
Dialogue#BERTRAM=dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is
Dialogue#BERTRAM=not to be recovered.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=It might have been recovered.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=It might; but it is not now.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=It is to be recovered: but that the merit of
Dialogue#PAROLLES=service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
Dialogue#PAROLLES=performer, I would have that drum or another, or
Dialogue#PAROLLES='hic jacet.'
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you
Dialogue#BERTRAM=think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
Dialogue#BERTRAM=instrument of honour again into his native quarter,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will

Dialogue#BERTRAM=But you must not now slumber in it.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=I'll about it this evening: and I will presently
Dialogue#PAROLLES=pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my
Dialogue#PAROLLES=certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;

Dialogue#Second Lord=damned than to do't?
Dialogue#First Lord=You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it

Dialogue#Second Lord=None in the world; but return with an invention and

Dialogue#Widow=That time and place with this deceit so lawful
Dialogue#Widow=May prove coherent. Every night he comes

Dialogue#PAROLLES=What the devil should move me to undertake the
Dialogue#PAROLLES=recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the
Dialogue#PAROLLES=impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I
Dialogue#PAROLLES=must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in
Dialogue#PAROLLES=exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they
Dialogue#PAROLLES=will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great
Dialogue#PAROLLES=ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the
Dialogue#PAROLLES=instance? Tongue, I must put you into a

Dialogue#Second Lord=that he is?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=I would the cutting of my garments would serve the

Dialogue#Second Lord=We cannot afford you so.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in
Dialogue#PAROLLES=stratagem.

Dialogue#Second Lord=Hardly serve.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.
Dialogue#Second Lord=How deep?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Thirty fathom.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.

Dialogue#BERTRAM=They told me that your name was Fontibell.
Dialogue#DIANA=No, my good lord, Diana.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Titled goddess;
Dialogue#BERTRAM=And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=In your fine frame hath love no quality?
Dialogue#BERTRAM=If quick fire of youth light not your mind,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=You are no maiden, but a monument:
Dialogue#BERTRAM=When you are dead, you should be such a one
Dialogue#BERTRAM=As you are now, for you are cold and stem;
Dialogue#BERTRAM=And now you should be as your mother was
Dialogue#BERTRAM=When your sweet self was got.
Dialogue#DIANA=She then was honest.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=So should you be.
Dialogue#DIANA=No:
Dialogue#DIANA=My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
Dialogue#DIANA=As you owe to your wife.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=No more o' that;
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I was compell'd to her; but I love thee
Dialogue#BERTRAM=By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Do thee all rights of service.
Dialogue#DIANA=Ay, so you serve us
Dialogue#DIANA=Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,
Dialogue#DIANA=You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
Dialogue#DIANA=And mock us with our bareness.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=How have I sworn!
Dialogue#DIANA='Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
Dialogue#DIANA=But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
Dialogue#DIANA=What is not holy, that we swear not by,
Dialogue#DIANA=But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,
Dialogue#DIANA=If I should swear by God's great attributes,
Dialogue#DIANA=I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,
Dialogue#DIANA=When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
Dialogue#DIANA=To swear by him whom I protest to love,
Dialogue#DIANA=That I will work against him: therefore your oaths
Dialogue#DIANA=Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,
Dialogue#DIANA=At least in my opinion.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Change it, change it;
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;
Dialogue#BERTRAM=And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
Dialogue#BERTRAM=That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=But give thyself unto my sick desires,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever
Dialogue#BERTRAM=My love as it begins shall so persever.
Dialogue#DIANA=I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
Dialogue#DIANA=That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power
Dialogue#BERTRAM=To give it from me.
Dialogue#DIANA=Will you not, my lord?
Dialogue#BERTRAM=It is an honour 'longing to our house,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
Dialogue#BERTRAM=In me to lose.
Dialogue#DIANA=                  Mine honour's such a ring:

Dialogue#DIANA=In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom
Dialogue#DIANA=Brings in the champion Honour on my part,
Dialogue#DIANA=Against your vain assault.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Here, take my ring:

Dialogue#BERTRAM=And I'll be bid by thee.
Dialogue#DIANA=When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:

Dialogue#DIANA=Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
Dialogue#DIANA=When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
Dialogue#DIANA=Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
Dialogue#DIANA=My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
Dialogue#DIANA=When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:
Dialogue#DIANA=And on your finger in the night I'll put
Dialogue#DIANA=Another ring, that what in time proceeds
Dialogue#DIANA=May token to the future our past deeds.
Dialogue#DIANA=Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won

Dialogue#DIANA=When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
Dialogue#DIANA=When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,

Notice#Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers
Dialogue#First Lord=You have not given him his mother's letter?
Dialogue#Second Lord=I have delivered it an hour since: there is
Dialogue#Second Lord=something in't that stings his nature; for on the
Dialogue#Second Lord=reading it he changed almost into another man.
Dialogue#First Lord=He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
Dialogue#First Lord=off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Especially he hath incurred the everlasting
Dialogue#Second Lord=displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his
Dialogue#Second Lord=bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a
Dialogue#Second Lord=thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.
Dialogue#First Lord=When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the
Dialogue#First Lord=grave of it.
Dialogue#Second Lord=He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
Dialogue#Second Lord=Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he
Dialogue#Second Lord=fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath
Dialogue#Second Lord=given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself
Dialogue#Second Lord=made in the unchaste composition.
Dialogue#First Lord=Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,
Dialogue#First Lord=what things are we!
Dialogue#Second Lord=Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course
Dialogue#Second Lord=of all treasons, we still see them reveal
Dialogue#Second Lord=themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,
Dialogue#Second Lord=so he that in this action contrives against his own
Dialogue#Second Lord=nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.
Dialogue#First Lord=Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of
Dialogue#First Lord=our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his
Dialogue#First Lord=company to-night?
Dialogue#Second Lord=Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.
Dialogue#First Lord=That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see
Dialogue#First Lord=his company anatomized, that he might take a measure
Dialogue#First Lord=of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had
Dialogue#First Lord=set this counterfeit.
Dialogue#Second Lord=We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
Dialogue#Second Lord=presence must be the whip of the other.
Dialogue#First Lord=In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?
Dialogue#Second Lord=I hear there is an overture of peace.
Dialogue#First Lord=Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
Dialogue#Second Lord=What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel
Dialogue#Second Lord=higher, or return again into France?
Dialogue#First Lord=I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether
Dialogue#First Lord=of his council.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal
Dialogue#Second Lord=of his act.
Dialogue#First Lord=Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his
Dialogue#First Lord=house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques
Dialogue#First Lord=le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere
Dialogue#First Lord=sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the
Dialogue#First Lord=tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
Dialogue#First Lord=grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and
Dialogue#First Lord=now she sings in heaven.
Dialogue#Second Lord=How is this justified?
Dialogue#First Lord=The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
Dialogue#First Lord=makes her story true, even to the point of her
Dialogue#First Lord=death: her death itself, which could not be her
Dialogue#First Lord=office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
Dialogue#First Lord=the rector of the place.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Hath the count all this intelligence?
Dialogue#First Lord=Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
Dialogue#First Lord=point, so to the full arming of the verity.
Dialogue#Second Lord=I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
Dialogue#First Lord=How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!
Dialogue#Second Lord=And how mightily some other times we drown our gain
Dialogue#Second Lord=in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath
Dialogue#Second Lord=here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
Dialogue#Second Lord=with a shame as ample.
Dialogue#First Lord=The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and
Dialogue#First Lord=ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our
Dialogue#First Lord=faults whipped them not; and our crimes would
Dialogue#First Lord=despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.
Notice#Enter a Messenger
Dialogue#First Lord=How now! where's your master?
Dialogue#Servant=He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath
Dialogue#Servant=taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next
Dialogue#Servant=morning for France. The duke hath offered him
Dialogue#Servant=letters of commendations to the king.
Dialogue#Second Lord=They shall be no more than needful there, if they
Dialogue#Second Lord=were more than they can commend.
Dialogue#First Lord=They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.
Dialogue#First Lord=Here's his lordship now.
Notice#Enter BERTRAM
Dialogue#First Lord=How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a
Dialogue#BERTRAM=month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his
Dialogue#BERTRAM=nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my
Dialogue#BERTRAM=lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;
Dialogue#BERTRAM=and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
Dialogue#BERTRAM=many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but
Dialogue#BERTRAM=that I have not ended yet.
Dialogue#Second Lord=If the business be of any difficulty, and this
Dialogue#Second Lord=morning your departure hence, it requires haste of
Dialogue#Second Lord=your lordship.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to
Dialogue#BERTRAM=hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this
Dialogue#BERTRAM=dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived
Dialogue#BERTRAM=me, like a double-meaning prophesier.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,
Dialogue#Second Lord=poor gallant knave.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping
Dialogue#BERTRAM=his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
Dialogue#Second Lord=I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry
Dialogue#Second Lord=him. But to answer you as you would be understood;
Dialogue#Second Lord=he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he
Dialogue#Second Lord=hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes
Dialogue#Second Lord=to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to
Dialogue#Second Lord=this very instant disaster of his setting i' the
Dialogue#Second Lord=stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Nothing of me, has a'?
Dialogue#Second Lord=His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
Dialogue#Second Lord=face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you
Dialogue#Second Lord=are, you must have the patience to hear it.

Dialogue#First Soldier=You are a merciful general. Our general bids you
Dialogue#First Soldier=answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=And truly, as I hope to live.
Dialogue#First Soldier=[Reads]  'First demand of him how many horse the
Dialogue#First Soldier=duke is strong.' What say you to that?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Five or six thousand; but very weak and
Dialogue#PAROLLES=unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and
Dialogue#PAROLLES=the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation
Dialogue#PAROLLES=and credit and as I hope to live.
Dialogue#First Soldier=Shall I set down your answer so?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
Dialogue#First Lord=You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur
Dialogue#First Lord=Parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own
Dialogue#First Lord=phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the
Dialogue#First Lord=knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of
Dialogue#First Lord=his dagger.
Dialogue#Second Lord=I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
Dialogue#Second Lord=clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him
Dialogue#Second Lord=by wearing his apparel neatly.
Dialogue#First Soldier=Well, that's set down.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Five or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say
Dialogue#PAROLLES=true,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.
Dialogue#First Lord=He's very near the truth in this.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he
Dialogue#BERTRAM=delivers it.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Poor rogues, I pray you, say.
Dialogue#First Soldier=Well, that's set down.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the
Dialogue#PAROLLES=rogues are marvellous poor.
Dialogue#First Soldier=[Reads]  'Demand of him, of what strength they are
Dialogue#First Soldier=a-foot.' What say you to that?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present
Dialogue#PAROLLES=hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a
Dialogue#PAROLLES=hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so
Dialogue#PAROLLES=many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,
Dialogue#PAROLLES=and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own
Dialogue#PAROLLES=company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and
Dialogue#PAROLLES=fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and
Dialogue#PAROLLES=sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand
Dialogue#PAROLLES=poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off
Dialogue#PAROLLES=their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=What shall be done to him?
Dialogue#First Lord=Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my

Dialogue#PAROLLES=I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of
Dialogue#PAROLLES=the inter'gatories: demand them singly.
Dialogue#First Soldier=Do you know this Captain Dumain?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,

Dialogue#BERTRAM=his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
Dialogue#First Soldier=Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.
Dialogue#First Lord=Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
Dialogue#First Lord=lordship anon.
Dialogue#First Soldier=What is his reputation with the duke?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
Dialogue#PAROLLES=of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him
Dialogue#PAROLLES=out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.
Dialogue#First Soldier=Marry, we'll search.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,
Dialogue#PAROLLES=or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters
Dialogue#PAROLLES=in my tent.
Dialogue#First Soldier=Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=I do not know if it be it or no.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Our interpreter does it well.
Dialogue#First Lord=Excellently.
Dialogue#First Soldier=[Reads]  'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--
Dialogue#PAROLLES=That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an
Dialogue#PAROLLES=advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very
Dialogue#PAROLLES=ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.
Dialogue#First Soldier=Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the
Dialogue#PAROLLES=behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be
Dialogue#PAROLLES=a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to
Dialogue#PAROLLES=virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Damnable both-sides rogue!
Dialogue#First Soldier=[Reads]  'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;

Dialogue#First Soldier=fain to hang you.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to
Dialogue#PAROLLES=die; but that, my offences being many, I would
Dialogue#PAROLLES=repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,
Dialogue#PAROLLES=sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.
Dialogue#First Soldier=We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
Dialogue#First Soldier=therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you
Dialogue#First Soldier=have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
Dialogue#First Soldier=his valour: what is his honesty?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for
Dialogue#PAROLLES=rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he
Dialogue#PAROLLES=professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he
Dialogue#PAROLLES=is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with
Dialogue#PAROLLES=such volubility, that you would think truth were a
Dialogue#PAROLLES=fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will
Dialogue#PAROLLES=be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little
Dialogue#PAROLLES=harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they
Dialogue#PAROLLES=know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but
Dialogue#PAROLLES=little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has
Dialogue#PAROLLES=every thing that an honest man should not have; what
Dialogue#PAROLLES=an honest man should have, he has nothing.
Dialogue#First Lord=I begin to love him for this.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon
Dialogue#BERTRAM=him for me, he's more and more a cat.
Dialogue#First Soldier=What say you to his expertness in war?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English
Dialogue#PAROLLES=tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of
Dialogue#PAROLLES=his soldiership I know not; except, in that country
Dialogue#PAROLLES=he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
Dialogue#PAROLLES=called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of
Dialogue#PAROLLES=files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of
Dialogue#PAROLLES=this I am not certain.
Dialogue#First Lord=He hath out-villained villany so far, that the
Dialogue#First Lord=rarity redeems him.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=A pox on him, he's a cat still.
Dialogue#First Soldier=His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
Dialogue#First Soldier=to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple
Dialogue#PAROLLES=of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the
Dialogue#PAROLLES=entail from all remainders, and a perpetual
Dialogue#PAROLLES=succession for it perpetually.
Dialogue#First Soldier=What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
Dialogue#Second Lord=Why does be ask him of me?
Dialogue#First Soldier=What's he?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so
Dialogue#PAROLLES=great as the first in goodness, but greater a great
Dialogue#PAROLLES=deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward,
Dialogue#PAROLLES=yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is:
Dialogue#PAROLLES=in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming
Dialogue#PAROLLES=on he has the cramp.
Dialogue#First Soldier=If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
Dialogue#First Soldier=the Florentine?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.
Dialogue#First Soldier=I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.
Dialogue#PAROLLES=[Aside]  I'll no more drumming; a plague of all
Dialogue#PAROLLES=drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to
Dialogue#PAROLLES=beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
Dialogue#PAROLLES=the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who
Dialogue#PAROLLES=would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?
Dialogue#First Soldier=There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the
Dialogue#First Soldier=general says, you that have so traitorously
Dialogue#First Soldier=discovered the secrets of your army and made such
Dialogue#First Soldier=pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can

Dialogue#LAFEU=fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have
Dialogue#LAFEU=made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in
Dialogue#LAFEU=his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at
Dialogue#LAFEU=this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced
Dialogue#LAFEU=by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=I would I had not known him; it was the death of the
Dialogue#COUNTESS=most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
Dialogue#COUNTESS=praise for creating. If she had partaken of my
Dialogue#COUNTESS=flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I
Dialogue#COUNTESS=could not have owed her a more rooted love.
Dialogue#LAFEU='Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a
Dialogue#LAFEU=thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.
Dialogue#Clown=Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the
Dialogue#Clown=salad, or rather, the herb of grace.
Dialogue#LAFEU=They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.
Dialogue#Clown=I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much
Dialogue#Clown=skill in grass.
Dialogue#LAFEU=Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?
Dialogue#Clown=A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.
Dialogue#LAFEU=Your distinction?
Dialogue#Clown=I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.
Dialogue#LAFEU=So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
Dialogue#Clown=And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
Dialogue#LAFEU=I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.
Dialogue#Clown=At your service.
Dialogue#LAFEU=No, no, no.
Dialogue#Clown=Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as
Dialogue#Clown=great a prince as you are.
Dialogue#LAFEU=Who's that? a Frenchman?
Dialogue#Clown=Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy
Dialogue#Clown=is more hotter in France than there.
Dialogue#LAFEU=What prince is that?
Dialogue#Clown=The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of
Dialogue#Clown=darkness; alias, the devil.
Dialogue#LAFEU=Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this
Dialogue#LAFEU=to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;
Dialogue#LAFEU=serve him still.
Dialogue#Clown=I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a
Dialogue#Clown=great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a
Dialogue#Clown=good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the
Dialogue#Clown=world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for
Dialogue#Clown=the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be
Dialogue#Clown=too little for pomp to enter: some that humble
Dialogue#Clown=themselves may; but the many will be too chill and
Dialogue#Clown=tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that
Dialogue#Clown=leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
Dialogue#LAFEU=Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I
Dialogue#LAFEU=tell thee so before, because I would not fall out
Dialogue#LAFEU=with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well
Dialogue#LAFEU=looked to, without any tricks.
Dialogue#Clown=If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be
Dialogue#Clown=jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#LAFEU=A shrewd knave and an unhappy.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much
Dialogue#COUNTESS=sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.
Dialogue#LAFEU=I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to
Dialogue#LAFEU=tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and
Dialogue#LAFEU=that my lord your son was upon his return home, I
Dialogue#LAFEU=moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of
Dialogue#LAFEU=my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,
Dialogue#LAFEU=his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did
Dialogue#LAFEU=first propose: his highness hath promised me to do
Dialogue#LAFEU=it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath
Dialogue#LAFEU=conceived against your son, there is no fitter
Dialogue#LAFEU=matter. How does your ladyship like it?
Dialogue#COUNTESS=With very much content, my lord; and I wish it
Dialogue#COUNTESS=happily effected.
Dialogue#LAFEU=His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able
Dialogue#LAFEU=body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here
Dialogue#LAFEU=to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such
Dialogue#LAFEU=intelligence hath seldom failed.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
Dialogue#COUNTESS=die. I have letters that my son will be here
Dialogue#COUNTESS=to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain
Dialogue#COUNTESS=with me till they meet together.
Dialogue#LAFEU=Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might
Dialogue#LAFEU=safely be admitted.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=You need but plead your honourable privilege.
Dialogue#LAFEU=Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I
Dialogue#LAFEU=thank my God it holds yet.
Notice#Re-enter Clown
Dialogue#Clown=O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of
Dialogue#Clown=velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't
Dialogue#Clown=or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of
Dialogue#Clown=velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a
Dialogue#Clown=half, but his right cheek is worn bare.
Dialogue#LAFEU=A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery
Dialogue#LAFEU=of honour; so belike is that.
Dialogue#Clown=But it is your carbonadoed face.
Dialogue#LAFEU=Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk
Dialogue#LAFEU=with the young noble soldier.

Dialogue#LAFEU=Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady

Dialogue#BERTRAM=Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Extended or contracted all proportions
Dialogue#BERTRAM=To a most hideous object: thence it came
Dialogue#BERTRAM=That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
Dialogue#BERTRAM=The dust that did offend it.
Dialogue#KING=Well excused:
Dialogue#KING=That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
Dialogue#KING=From the great compt: but love that comes too late,
Dialogue#KING=Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
Dialogue#KING=To the great sender turns a sour offence,
Dialogue#KING=Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults
Dialogue#KING=Make trivial price of serious things we have,

Dialogue#LAFEU=The last that e'er I took her at court,
Dialogue#LAFEU=I saw upon her finger.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Hers it was not.
Dialogue#KING=Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
Dialogue#KING=While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.
Dialogue#KING=This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,
Dialogue#KING=I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
Dialogue#KING=Necessitied to help, that by this token
Dialogue#KING=I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave
Dialogue#KING=her
Dialogue#KING=Of what should stead her most?
Dialogue#BERTRAM=My gracious sovereign,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=The ring was never hers.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Son, on my life,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
Dialogue#COUNTESS=At her life's rate.
Dialogue#LAFEU=I am sure I saw her wear it.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:
Dialogue#BERTRAM=In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed
Dialogue#BERTRAM=To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I could not answer in that course of honour
Dialogue#BERTRAM=As she had made the overture, she ceased

Dialogue#KING=That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,
Dialogue#KING=Hath not in nature's mystery more science

Dialogue#KING=Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
Dialogue#KING=That you are well acquainted with yourself,
Dialogue#KING=Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
Dialogue#KING=You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety
Dialogue#KING=That she would never put it from her finger,
Dialogue#KING=Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
Dialogue#KING=Where you have never come, or sent it us
Dialogue#KING=Upon her great disaster.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=She never saw it.
Dialogue#KING=Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
Dialogue#KING=And makest conjectural fears to come into me
Dialogue#KING=Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
Dialogue#KING=That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--
Dialogue#KING=And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,
Dialogue#KING=And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
Dialogue#KING=Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
Dialogue#KING=More than to see this ring. Take him away.
Notice#Guards seize BERTRAM

Dialogue#KING=Come hither, count; do you know these women?
Dialogue#BERTRAM=My lord, I neither can nor will deny
Dialogue#BERTRAM=But that I know them: do they charge me further?
Dialogue#DIANA=Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
Dialogue#BERTRAM=She's none of mine, my lord.
Dialogue#DIANA=If you shall marry,
Dialogue#DIANA=You give away this hand, and that is mine;

Dialogue#KING=Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
Dialogue#KING=Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour
Dialogue#KING=Than in my thought it lies.
Dialogue#DIANA=Good my lord,
Dialogue#DIANA=Ask him upon his oath, if he does think
Dialogue#DIANA=He had not my virginity.
Dialogue#KING=What say'st thou to her?
Dialogue#BERTRAM=She's impudent, my lord,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=And was a common gamester to the camp.
Dialogue#DIANA=He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
Dialogue#DIANA=He might have bought me at a common price:
Dialogue#DIANA=Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
Dialogue#DIANA=Whose high respect and rich validity
Dialogue#DIANA=Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
Dialogue#DIANA=He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,
Dialogue#DIANA=If I be one.
Dialogue#COUNTESS=                  He blushes, and 'tis it:
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,
Dialogue#COUNTESS=Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;
Dialogue#COUNTESS=That ring's a thousand proofs.
Dialogue#KING=Methought you said
Dialogue#KING=You saw one here in court could witness it.
Dialogue#DIANA=I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
Dialogue#DIANA=So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.
Dialogue#LAFEU=I saw the man to-day, if man he be.
Dialogue#KING=Find him, and bring him hither.
Notice#Exit an Attendant
Dialogue#BERTRAM=What of him?
Dialogue#BERTRAM=He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=That will speak any thing?
Dialogue#KING=She hath that ring of yours.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I think she has: certain it is I liked her,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:
Dialogue#BERTRAM=She knew her distance and did angle for me,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=As all impediments in fancy's course
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;
Dialogue#BERTRAM=And I had that which any inferior might
Dialogue#BERTRAM=At market-price have bought.
Dialogue#DIANA=I must be patient:
Dialogue#DIANA=You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,
Dialogue#DIANA=May justly diet me. I pray you yet;
Dialogue#DIANA=Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;
Dialogue#DIANA=Send for your ring, I will return it home,
Dialogue#DIANA=And give me mine again.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I have it not.
Dialogue#KING=What ring was yours, I pray you?
Dialogue#DIANA=Sir, much like
Dialogue#DIANA=The same upon your finger.
Dialogue#KING=Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.
Dialogue#DIANA=And this was it I gave him, being abed.
Dialogue#KING=The story then goes false, you threw it him
Dialogue#KING=Out of a casement.
Dialogue#DIANA=                  I have spoke the truth.
Notice#Enter PAROLLES
Dialogue#BERTRAM=My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
Dialogue#KING=You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.
Dialogue#KING=Is this the man you speak of?
Dialogue#DIANA=Ay, my lord.
Dialogue#KING=Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,
Dialogue#KING=Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
Dialogue#KING=Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,
Dialogue#KING=By him and by this woman here what know you?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=So please your majesty, my master hath been an
Dialogue#PAROLLES=honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,
Dialogue#PAROLLES=which gentlemen have.
Dialogue#KING=Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?
Dialogue#KING=How, I pray you?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
Dialogue#KING=How is that?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=He loved her, sir, and loved her not.
Dialogue#KING=As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an
Dialogue#KING=equivocal companion is this!
Dialogue#PAROLLES=I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.
Dialogue#LAFEU=He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.
Dialogue#DIANA=Do you know he promised me marriage?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Faith, I know more than I'll speak.
Dialogue#KING=But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?
Dialogue#PAROLLES=Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,
Dialogue#PAROLLES=as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for
Dialogue#PAROLLES=indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and
Dialogue#PAROLLES=of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I
Dialogue#PAROLLES=was in that credit with them at that time that I
Dialogue#PAROLLES=knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,
Dialogue#PAROLLES=as promising her marriage, and things which would
Dialogue#PAROLLES=derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not
Dialogue#PAROLLES=speak what I know.
Dialogue#KING=Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say
Dialogue#KING=they are married: but thou art too fine in thy
Dialogue#KING=evidence; therefore stand aside.
Dialogue#KING=This ring, you say, was yours?
Dialogue#DIANA=Ay, my good lord.
Dialogue#KING=Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?
Dialogue#DIANA=It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
Dialogue#KING=Who lent it you?
Dialogue#DIANA=                  It was not lent me neither.
Dialogue#KING=Where did you find it, then?
Dialogue#DIANA=I found it not.
Dialogue#KING=If it were yours by none of all these ways,
Dialogue#KING=How could you give it him?
Dialogue#DIANA=I never gave it him.
Dialogue#LAFEU=This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off
Dialogue#LAFEU=and on at pleasure.
Dialogue#KING=This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.
Dialogue#DIANA=It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.
Dialogue#KING=Take her away; I do not like her now;
Dialogue#KING=To prison with her: and away with him.
Dialogue#KING=Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
Dialogue#KING=Thou diest within this hour.
Dialogue#DIANA=I'll never tell you.
Dialogue#KING=Take her away.
Dialogue#DIANA=                  I'll put in bail, my liege.
Dialogue#KING=I think thee now some common customer.
Dialogue#DIANA=By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
Dialogue#KING=Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?
Dialogue#DIANA=Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:
Dialogue#DIANA=He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;
Dialogue#DIANA=I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
Dialogue#DIANA=Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
Dialogue#DIANA=I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.
Dialogue#KING=She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.
Dialogue#DIANA=Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:
Notice#Exit Widow
Dialogue#DIANA=The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
Dialogue#DIANA=And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
Dialogue#DIANA=Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,
Dialogue#DIANA=Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:
Dialogue#DIANA=He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;
Dialogue#DIANA=And at that time he got his wife with child:
Dialogue#DIANA=Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
Dialogue#DIANA=So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
Dialogue#DIANA=And now behold the meaning.
Notice#Re-enter Widow, with HELENA
Dialogue#KING=Is there no exorcist
Dialogue#KING=Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
Dialogue#KING=Is't real that I see?
Dialogue#HELENA=No, my good lord;
Dialogue#HELENA='Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
Dialogue#HELENA=The name and not the thing.
Dialogue#BERTRAM=Both, both. O, pardon!
Dialogue#HELENA=O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
Dialogue#HELENA=I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
Dialogue#HELENA=And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
Dialogue#HELENA='When from my finger you can get this ring
Dialogue#HELENA= c. This is done:
Dialogue#HELENA=Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?
Dialogue#BERTRAM=If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
Dialogue#BERTRAM=I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.
Dialogue#HELENA=If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
Dialogue#HELENA=Deadly divorce step between me and you!
Dialogue#HELENA=O my dear mother, do I see you living?
Dialogue#LAFEU=Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:
Notice#To PAROLLES
Dialogue#LAFEU=Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
Dialogue#LAFEU=I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:
Dialogue#LAFEU=Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.
Dialogue#KING=Let us from point to point this story know,
Dialogue#KING=To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
Notice#To DIANA
Dialogue#KING=If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
Dialogue#KING=Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
Dialogue#KING=For I can guess that by thy honest aid
Dialogue#KING=Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
Dialogue#KING=Of that and all the progress, more or less,
Dialogue#KING=Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
Dialogue#KING=All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
Dialogue#KING=The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.
