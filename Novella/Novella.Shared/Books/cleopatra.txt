Dialogue:Messenger=To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Antony, thou wouldst say,--
Dialogue:Messenger=O, my lord!
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=With such full licence as both truth and malice
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,

Dialogue:Second Messenger=Importeth thee to know, this bears.
Notice:Gives a letter
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Forbear me.
Notice:Exit Second Messenger
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=By revolution lowering, does become
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=I must from this enchanting queen break off:
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!
Notice:Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=What's your pleasure, sir?
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=I must with haste from hence.
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=Why, then, we kill all our women:
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=I must be gone.
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=She is cunning past man's thought.
Notice:Exit ALEXAS
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=shower of rain as well as Jove.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Would I had never seen her.
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=of work; which not to have been blest withal would
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=have discredited your travel.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Fulvia is dead.
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=Sir?
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Fulvia is dead.
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=Fulvia!
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Dead.
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=comforting therein, that when old robes are worn
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=out, there are members to make new. If there were
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=that should water this sorrow.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=The business she hath broached in the state
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Cannot endure my absence.
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=And the business you have broached here cannot be
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=wholly depends on your abode.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=No more light answers. Let our officers
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Have notice what we purpose. I shall break

Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Of many our contriving friends in Rome
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands

Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Pompey the Great and all his dignities
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,

Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=What says the married woman? You may go:

Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=So mightily betray'd! yet at the first
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=I saw the treasons planted.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Cleopatra,--
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Why should I think you can be mine and true,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Which break themselves in swearing!
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Most sweet queen,--
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Then was the time for words: no going then;
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=But was a race of heaven: they are so still,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,

Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=By any desperate change: my more particular,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=And that which most with you should safe my going,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Is Fulvia's death.
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=She's dead, my queen:
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=See when and where she died.
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=O most false love!
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,

Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=An honourable trial.
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=So Fulvia told me.

Dialogue:Messenger=The discontents repair, and men's reports
Dialogue:Messenger=Give him much wrong'd.
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=I should have known no less.
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=It hath been taught us from the primal state,
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=That he which is was wish'd until he were;
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=To rot itself with motion.
Dialogue:Messenger=Caesar, I bring thee word,
Dialogue:Messenger=Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
Dialogue:Messenger=Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
Dialogue:Messenger=With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
Dialogue:Messenger=They make in Italy; the borders maritime
Dialogue:Messenger=Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:
Dialogue:Messenger=No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
Dialogue:Messenger=Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
Dialogue:Messenger=Than could his war resisted.
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Antony,
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Though daintily brought up, with patience more
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Which some did die to look on: and all this--
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=So much as lank'd not.
Dialogue:LEPIDUS='Tis pity of him.
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Let his shames quickly

Dialogue:MARDIAN=But what indeed is honest to be done:
Dialogue:MARDIAN=Yet have I fierce affections, and think
Dialogue:MARDIAN=What Venus did with Mars.
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=O Charmian,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=For so he calls me: now I feed myself
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=With most delicious poison. Think on me,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=When thou wast here above the ground, I was
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;

Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
Dialogue:ALEXAS=Last thing he did, dear queen,
Dialogue:ALEXAS=He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--
Dialogue:ALEXAS=This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Mine ear must pluck it thence.
Dialogue:ALEXAS='Good friend,' quoth he,
Dialogue:ALEXAS='Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
Dialogue:ALEXAS=This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
Dialogue:ALEXAS=To mend the petty present, I will piece
Dialogue:ALEXAS=Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,

Dialogue:ALEXAS=And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
Dialogue:ALEXAS=Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke
Dialogue:ALEXAS=Was beastly dumb'd by him.
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=What, was he sad or merry?
Dialogue:ALEXAS=Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
Dialogue:ALEXAS=Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=O well-divided disposition! Note him,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=He was not sad, for he would shine on those
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=The violence of either thee becomes,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
Dialogue:ALEXAS=Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:
Dialogue:ALEXAS=Why do you send so thick?
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Who's born that day
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=When I forget to send to Antony,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,

Dialogue:CHARMIAN=O that brave Caesar!
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Be choked with such another emphasis!
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=Say, the brave Antony.
Dialogue:CHARMIAN=The valiant Caesar!
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=If thou with Caesar paragon again
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=My man of men.
Dialogue:CHARMIAN=                  By your most gracious pardon,

Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Made wars upon me; and their contestation
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Was theme for you, you were the word of war.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=You do mistake your business; my brother never
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=And have my learning from some true reports,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Discredit my authority with yours;
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=And make the wars alike against my stomach,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Having alike your cause? Of this my letters

Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Very necessity of this thought, that I,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=I would you had her spirit in such another:
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=Would we had all such wives, that the men might go

Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=I wrote to you
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=When rioting in Alexandria; you
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Did gibe my missive out of audience.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Sir,

Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Of what I was i' the morning: but next day
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=I told him of myself; which was as much
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Out of our question wipe him.
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=You have broken
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=The article of your oath; which you shall never

Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=No,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Lepidus, let him speak:
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=The honour is sacred which he talks on now,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=The article of my oath.
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=To lend me arms and aid when I required them;
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=The which you both denied.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Neglected, rather;
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=And then when poison'd hours had bound me up
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,

Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=To stoop in such a case.
Dialogue:LEPIDUS='Tis noble spoken.
Dialogue:MECAENAS=If it might please you, to enforce no further
Dialogue:MECAENAS=The griefs between ye: to forget them quite
Dialogue:MECAENAS=Were to remember that the present need
Dialogue:MECAENAS=Speaks to atone you.
Dialogue:LEPIDUS=Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=Or, if you borrow one another's love for the
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=instant, you may, when you hear no more words of
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.

Dialogue:AGRIPPA=Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
Dialogue:AGRIPPA=No worse a husband than the best of men;
Dialogue:AGRIPPA=Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
Dialogue:AGRIPPA=That which none else can utter. By this marriage,
Dialogue:AGRIPPA=All little jealousies, which now seem great,
Dialogue:AGRIPPA=And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
Dialogue:AGRIPPA=Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,
Dialogue:AGRIPPA=Where now half tales be truths: her love to both
Dialogue:AGRIPPA=Would, each to other and all loves to both,
Dialogue:AGRIPPA=Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
Dialogue:AGRIPPA=For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
Dialogue:AGRIPPA=By duty ruminated.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=                  Will Caesar speak?
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=With what is spoke already.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=What power is in Agrippa,
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=To make this good?

Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=What is his strength by land?
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=Great and increasing: but by sea
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS CAESAR=He is an absolute master.
Dialogue:MARK ANTONY=So is the fame.

Dialogue:MECAENAS=We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
Dialogue:MECAENAS=digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=made the night light with drinking.
Dialogue:MECAENAS=Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and
Dialogue:MECAENAS=but twelve persons there; is this true?
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
Dialogue:MECAENAS=She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to
Dialogue:MECAENAS=her.

Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=I will tell you.
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=The water which they beat to follow faster,

Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=I think so too. But you shall find, the band that
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=seems to tie their friendship together will be the
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=holy, cold, and still conversation.
Dialogue:MENAS=Who would not have his wife so?
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=I said before, that which is the strength of their
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=amity shall prove the immediate author of their
Dialogue:DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS=variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:

Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;

Dialogue:DOLABELLA=I understand not, madam.
Dialogue:CLEOPATRA=I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
