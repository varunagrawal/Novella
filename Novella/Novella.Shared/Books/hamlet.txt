Dialogue#BERNARDO=Who's there?
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Long live the king!
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=Bernardo?
Dialogue#BERNARDO=He.
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=You come most carefully upon your hour.
Dialogue#BERNARDO='Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=And I am sick at heart.
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Have you had quiet guard?
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=Not a mouse stirring.
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Well, good night.
Dialogue#BERNARDO=If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,

Dialogue#FRANCISCO=Give you good night.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Holla! Bernardo!
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Say,
Dialogue#BERNARDO=What, is Horatio there?
Dialogue#HORATIO=A piece of him.
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
Dialogue#BERNARDO=I have seen nothing.
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=And will not let belief take hold of him
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Therefore I have entreated him along
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=With us to watch the minutes of this night;
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=That if again this apparition come,
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
Dialogue#HORATIO=Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Sit down awhile;
Dialogue#BERNARDO=And let us once again assail your ears,
Dialogue#BERNARDO=That are so fortified against our story
Dialogue#BERNARDO=What we have two nights seen.
Dialogue#HORATIO=Well, sit we down,
Dialogue#HORATIO=And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Last night of all,
Dialogue#BERNARDO=When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Dialogue#BERNARDO=The bell then beating one,--
Notice#Enter Ghost
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
Dialogue#BERNARDO=In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.
Dialogue#HORATIO=Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
Dialogue#BERNARDO=It would be spoke to.
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Question it, Horatio.
Dialogue#HORATIO=What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Together with that fair and warlike form
Dialogue#HORATIO=In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Dialogue#HORATIO=Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=It is offended.
Dialogue#BERNARDO=                  See, it stalks away!
Dialogue#HORATIO=Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Notice#Exit Ghost
Dialogue#MARCELLUS='Tis gone, and will not answer.
Dialogue#BERNARDO=How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Is not this something more than fantasy?
Dialogue#BERNARDO=What think you on't?
Dialogue#HORATIO=Before my God, I might not this believe
Dialogue#HORATIO=Without the sensible and true avouch
Dialogue#HORATIO=Of mine own eyes.
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=                  Is it not like the king?
Dialogue#HORATIO=As thou art to thyself:
Dialogue#HORATIO=Such was the very armour he had on
Dialogue#HORATIO=When he the ambitious Norway combated;
Dialogue#HORATIO=So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
Dialogue#HORATIO=He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
Dialogue#HORATIO='Tis strange.
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
Dialogue#HORATIO=In what particular thought to work I know not;
Dialogue#HORATIO=But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
Dialogue#HORATIO=This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Why this same strict and most observant watch
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=So nightly toils the subject of the land,
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=And foreign mart for implements of war;
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Who is't that can inform me?
Dialogue#HORATIO=That can I;
Dialogue#HORATIO=At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
Dialogue#HORATIO=For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
Dialogue#HORATIO=Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Dialogue#HORATIO=Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Dialogue#HORATIO=Against the which, a moiety competent
Dialogue#HORATIO=Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
Dialogue#HORATIO=To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
Dialogue#HORATIO=And carriage of the article design'd,
Dialogue#HORATIO=His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Dialogue#HORATIO=Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
Dialogue#HORATIO=For food and diet, to some enterprise
Dialogue#HORATIO=That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
Dialogue#HORATIO=As it doth well appear unto our state--
Dialogue#HORATIO=But to recover of us, by strong hand
Dialogue#HORATIO=And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
Dialogue#HORATIO=So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Is the main motive of our preparations,
Dialogue#HORATIO=The source of this our watch and the chief head
Dialogue#HORATIO=Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
Dialogue#BERNARDO=I think it be no other but e'en so:
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
Dialogue#BERNARDO=That was and is the question of these wars.
Dialogue#HORATIO=A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
Dialogue#HORATIO=In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
Dialogue#HORATIO=A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
Dialogue#HORATIO=The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Dialogue#HORATIO=Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
Dialogue#HORATIO=As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Dialogue#HORATIO=Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Dialogue#HORATIO=Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
Dialogue#HORATIO=And even the like precurse of fierce events,
Dialogue#HORATIO=As harbingers preceding still the fates
Dialogue#HORATIO=And prologue to the omen coming on,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Dialogue#HORATIO=Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
Dialogue#HORATIO=But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
Notice#Re-enter Ghost
Dialogue#HORATIO=I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
Dialogue#HORATIO=If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Speak to me:
Dialogue#HORATIO=If there be any good thing to be done,
Dialogue#HORATIO=That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Speak to me:
Notice#Cock crows
Dialogue#HORATIO=If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Dialogue#HORATIO=Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Dialogue#HORATIO=Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
Dialogue#HORATIO=For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Dialogue#HORATIO=Do, if it will not stand.
Dialogue#BERNARDO='Tis here!
Dialogue#HORATIO='Tis here!
Dialogue#MARCELLUS='Tis gone!
Notice#Exit Ghost
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=We do it wrong, being so majestical,
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=To offer it the show of violence;
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=And our vain blows malicious mockery.
Dialogue#BERNARDO=It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
Dialogue#HORATIO=And then it started like a guilty thing
Dialogue#HORATIO=Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
Dialogue#HORATIO=The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Dialogue#HORATIO=Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Dialogue#HORATIO=The extravagant and erring spirit hies
Dialogue#HORATIO=To his confine: and of the truth herein
Dialogue#HORATIO=This present object made probation.
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
Dialogue#HORATIO=So have I heard and do in part believe it.
Dialogue#HORATIO=But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Dialogue#HORATIO=Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Dialogue#HORATIO=Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
Dialogue#HORATIO=This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Dialogue#HORATIO=Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
Dialogue#HORATIO=As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=Where we shall find him most conveniently.

Notice#Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,  POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=The memory be green, and that it us befitted
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Importing the surrender of those lands
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Thus much the business is: we have here writ
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=His further gait herein; in that the levies,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=The lists and full proportions, are all made
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Giving to you no further personal power
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=To business with the king, more than the scope
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Of these delated articles allow.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
Dialogue#VOLTIMAND=In that and all things will we show our duty.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
Notice#Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=The head is not more native to the heart,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
Dialogue#LAERTES=My dread lord,
Dialogue#LAERTES=Your leave and favour to return to France;
Dialogue#LAERTES=From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
Dialogue#LAERTES=To show my duty in your coronation,
Dialogue#LAERTES=Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
Dialogue#LAERTES=My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
Dialogue#LAERTES=And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=By laboursome petition, and at last
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
Dialogue#HAMLET=[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Passing through nature to eternity.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Ay, madam, it is common.
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=If it be,
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Why seems it so particular with thee?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
Dialogue#HAMLET='Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
Dialogue#HAMLET=No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
Dialogue#HAMLET=That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
Dialogue#HAMLET=For they are actions that a man might play:
Dialogue#HAMLET=But I have that within which passeth show;
Dialogue#HAMLET=These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS='Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=To give these mourning duties to your father:
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=But, you must know, your father lost a father;
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=In filial obligation for some term
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=In obstinate condolement is a course
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=An understanding simple and unschool'd:
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=For what we know must be and is as common
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Why should we in our peevish opposition
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=To reason most absurd: whose common theme
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=From the first corse till he that died to-day,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS='This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=This unprevailing woe, and think of us
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=As of a father: for let the world take note,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=You are the most immediate to our throne;
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And with no less nobility of love
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Do I impart toward you. For your intent
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=In going back to school in Wittenberg,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=It is most retrograde to our desire:
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
Dialogue#HAMLET=I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
Notice#Exeunt all but HAMLET
Dialogue#HAMLET=O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Dialogue#HAMLET=Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
Dialogue#HAMLET=Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
Dialogue#HAMLET=His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
Dialogue#HAMLET=How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Dialogue#HAMLET=Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
Dialogue#HAMLET=That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Dialogue#HAMLET=Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
Dialogue#HAMLET=But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
Dialogue#HAMLET=So excellent a king; that was, to this,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
Dialogue#HAMLET=That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Dialogue#HAMLET=Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Dialogue#HAMLET=Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
Dialogue#HAMLET=As if increase of appetite had grown
Dialogue#HAMLET=By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Dialogue#HAMLET=Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
Dialogue#HAMLET=A little month, or ere those shoes were old
Dialogue#HAMLET=With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
Dialogue#HAMLET=O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
Dialogue#HAMLET=My father's brother, but no more like my father
Dialogue#HAMLET=Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Dialogue#HAMLET=Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Dialogue#HAMLET=Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
Dialogue#HAMLET=She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
Dialogue#HAMLET=With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
Dialogue#HAMLET=It is not nor it cannot come to good:
Dialogue#HAMLET=But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
Notice#Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO
Dialogue#HORATIO=Hail to your lordship!
Dialogue#HAMLET=I am glad to see you well:
Dialogue#HAMLET=Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
Dialogue#HORATIO=The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
Dialogue#HAMLET=And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=My good lord--
Dialogue#HAMLET=I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
Dialogue#HAMLET=But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
Dialogue#HORATIO=A truant disposition, good my lord.
Dialogue#HAMLET=I would not hear your enemy say so,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
Dialogue#HAMLET=To make it truster of your own report
Dialogue#HAMLET=Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
Dialogue#HAMLET=But what is your affair in Elsinore?
Dialogue#HAMLET=We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
Dialogue#HORATIO=My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
Dialogue#HAMLET=I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
Dialogue#HAMLET=I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
Dialogue#HORATIO=Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Dialogue#HAMLET=Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Dialogue#HAMLET=Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
Dialogue#HAMLET=My father!--methinks I see my father.
Dialogue#HORATIO=Where, my lord?
Dialogue#HAMLET=                  In my mind's eye, Horatio.
Dialogue#HORATIO=I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
Dialogue#HAMLET=He was a man, take him for all in all,
Dialogue#HAMLET=I shall not look upon his like again.
Dialogue#HORATIO=My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Saw? who?
Dialogue#HORATIO=My lord, the king your father.
Dialogue#HAMLET=The king my father!
Dialogue#HORATIO=Season your admiration for awhile
Dialogue#HORATIO=With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Dialogue#HORATIO=This marvel to you.
Dialogue#HAMLET=For God's love, let me hear.
Dialogue#HORATIO=Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
Dialogue#HORATIO=In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Appears before them, and with solemn march
Dialogue#HORATIO=Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
Dialogue#HORATIO=By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Dialogue#HORATIO=Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
Dialogue#HORATIO=In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
Dialogue#HORATIO=And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Dialogue#HORATIO=Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Dialogue#HORATIO=Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
Dialogue#HORATIO=The apparition comes: I knew your father;
Dialogue#HORATIO=These hands are not more like.
Dialogue#HAMLET=But where was this?
Dialogue#MARCELLUS=My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Did you not speak to it?
Dialogue#HORATIO=My lord, I did;
Dialogue#HORATIO=But answer made it none: yet once methought
Dialogue#HORATIO=It lifted up its head and did address
Dialogue#HORATIO=Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
Dialogue#HORATIO=But even then the morning cock crew loud,
Dialogue#HORATIO=And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
Dialogue#HORATIO=And vanish'd from our sight.
Dialogue#HAMLET='Tis very strange.
Dialogue#HORATIO=As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
Dialogue#HORATIO=And we did think it writ down in our duty
Dialogue#HORATIO=To let you know of it.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Hold you the watch to-night?
Dialogue#BERNARDO=We do, my lord.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Arm'd, say you?
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Arm'd, my lord.
Dialogue#HAMLET=From top to toe?
Dialogue#BERNARDO=My lord, from head to foot.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Then saw you not his face?
Dialogue#HORATIO=O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
Dialogue#HAMLET=What, look'd he frowningly?
Dialogue#HORATIO=A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Pale or red?
Dialogue#HORATIO=Nay, very pale.
Dialogue#HAMLET=                  And fix'd his eyes upon you?
Dialogue#HORATIO=Most constantly.
Dialogue#HAMLET=                  I would I had been there.
Dialogue#HORATIO=It would have much amazed you.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Dialogue#HORATIO=While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Dialogue#BERNARDO=Longer, longer.
Dialogue#HORATIO=Not when I saw't.
Dialogue#HAMLET=                  His beard was grizzled--no?
Dialogue#HORATIO=It was, as I have seen it in his life,
Dialogue#HORATIO=A sable silver'd.
Dialogue#HAMLET=                  I will watch to-night;
Dialogue#HAMLET=Perchance 'twill walk again.
Dialogue#HORATIO=I warrant it will.
Dialogue#HAMLET=If it assume my noble father's person,
Dialogue#HAMLET=I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
Dialogue#HAMLET=And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
Dialogue#HAMLET=If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Let it be tenable in your silence still;
Dialogue#HAMLET=And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
Dialogue#HAMLET=I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
Dialogue#HAMLET=Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
Dialogue#HAMLET=I'll visit you.
Dialogue#All=                  Our duty to your honour.

Dialogue#LAERTES=My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
Dialogue#LAERTES=And, sister, as the winds give benefit
Dialogue#LAERTES=And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
Dialogue#LAERTES=But let me hear from you.
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Do you doubt that?
Dialogue#LAERTES=For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
Dialogue#LAERTES=Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
Dialogue#LAERTES=A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Dialogue#LAERTES=Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
Dialogue#LAERTES=The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
Dialogue#OPHELIA=       No more but so?
Dialogue#LAERTES=Think it no more;
Dialogue#LAERTES=For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
Dialogue#LAERTES=In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
Dialogue#LAERTES=The inward service of the mind and soul
Dialogue#LAERTES=Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
Dialogue#LAERTES=And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
Dialogue#LAERTES=The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
Dialogue#LAERTES=His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
Dialogue#LAERTES=For he himself is subject to his birth:
Dialogue#LAERTES=He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Dialogue#LAERTES=Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
Dialogue#LAERTES=The safety and health of this whole state;
Dialogue#LAERTES=And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Dialogue#LAERTES=Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Dialogue#LAERTES=Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
Dialogue#LAERTES=It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
Dialogue#LAERTES=As he in his particular act and place
Dialogue#LAERTES=May give his saying deed; which is no further
Dialogue#LAERTES=Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Dialogue#LAERTES=Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
Dialogue#LAERTES=If with too credent ear you list his songs,
Dialogue#LAERTES=Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
Dialogue#LAERTES=To his unmaster'd importunity.
Dialogue#LAERTES=Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
Dialogue#LAERTES=And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Dialogue#LAERTES=Out of the shot and danger of desire.
Dialogue#LAERTES=The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
Dialogue#LAERTES=If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Dialogue#LAERTES=Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
Dialogue#LAERTES=The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Dialogue#LAERTES=Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
Dialogue#LAERTES=And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Dialogue#LAERTES=Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Dialogue#LAERTES=Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Dialogue#LAERTES=Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
Dialogue#OPHELIA=I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=And recks not his own rede.
Dialogue#LAERTES=O, fear me not.

Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=And they in France of the best rank and station
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=This above all: to thine ownself be true,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=And it must follow, as the night the day,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
Dialogue#LAERTES=Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.

Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=You do not understand yourself so clearly
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=What is between you? give me up the truth.
Dialogue#OPHELIA=He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Of his affection to me.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
Dialogue#OPHELIA=I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
Dialogue#OPHELIA=My lord, he hath importuned me with love
Dialogue#OPHELIA=In honourable fashion.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
Dialogue#OPHELIA=And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=You must not take for fire. From this time
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Believe so much in him, that he is young
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=And with a larger tether may he walk
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Not of that dye which their investments show,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=The better to beguile. This is for all:
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Have you so slander any moment leisure,

Dialogue#HAMLET=The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
Dialogue#HAMLET=The triumph of his pledge.
Dialogue#HORATIO=Is it a custom?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Ay, marry, is't:
Dialogue#HAMLET=But to my mind, though I am native here
Dialogue#HAMLET=And to the manner born, it is a custom
Dialogue#HAMLET=More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
Dialogue#HAMLET=This heavy-headed revel east and west
Dialogue#HAMLET=Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
Dialogue#HAMLET=They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
Dialogue#HAMLET=Soil our addition; and indeed it takes

Dialogue#Ghost=A couch for luxury and damned incest.
Dialogue#Ghost=But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Dialogue#Ghost=Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive

Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=What company, at what expense; and finding
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=By this encompassment and drift of question
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=That they do know my son, come you more nearer
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Than your particular demands will touch it:
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
Dialogue#REYNALDO=Ay, very well, my lord.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS='And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=As are companions noted and most known
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=To youth and liberty.
Dialogue#REYNALDO=As gaming, my lord.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,

Dialogue#REYNALDO=My lord, that would dishonour him.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS='Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=You must not put another scandal on him,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=That he is open to incontinency;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=That they may seem the taints of liberty,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Of general assault.
Dialogue#REYNALDO=But, my good lord,--
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Wherefore should you do this?
Dialogue#REYNALDO=Ay, my lord,
Dialogue#REYNALDO=I would know that.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=                  Marry, sir, here's my drift;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=You laying these slight sullies on my son,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Your party in converse, him you would sound,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=He closes with you in this consequence;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS='Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=According to the phrase or the addition
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Of man and country.
Dialogue#REYNALDO=Very good, my lord.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=something: where did I leave?
Dialogue#REYNALDO=At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
Dialogue#REYNALDO=and 'gentleman.'
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS='I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=See you now;
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=With windlasses and with assays of bias,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=By indirections find directions out:
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=So by my former lecture and advice,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
Dialogue#REYNALDO=My lord, I have.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=                  God be wi' you; fare you well.

Dialogue#OPHELIA=My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
Dialogue#OPHELIA=No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
Dialogue#OPHELIA=And with a look so piteous in purport
Dialogue#OPHELIA=As if he had been loosed out of hell
Dialogue#OPHELIA=To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Mad for thy love?
Dialogue#OPHELIA=                  My lord, I do not know;
Dialogue#OPHELIA=But truly, I do fear it.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=What said he?
Dialogue#OPHELIA=He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
Dialogue#OPHELIA=And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=He falls to such perusal of my face
Dialogue#OPHELIA=As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
Dialogue#OPHELIA=At last, a little shaking of mine arm
Dialogue#OPHELIA=And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
Dialogue#OPHELIA=As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
Dialogue#OPHELIA=And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
Dialogue#OPHELIA=And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
Dialogue#OPHELIA=For out o' doors he went without their helps,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=And, to the last, bended their light on me.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=This is the very ecstasy of love,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Whose violent property fordoes itself
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=And leads the will to desperate undertakings
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=As oft as any passion under heaven
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=What, have you given him any hard words of late?
Dialogue#OPHELIA=No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=I did repel his fetters and denied
Dialogue#OPHELIA=His access to me.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=                  That hath made him mad.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=By heaven, it is as proper to our age
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=As it is common for the younger sort
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:

Dialogue#VOLTIMAND=Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
Dialogue#VOLTIMAND=His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
Dialogue#VOLTIMAND=To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;

Dialogue#HAMLET=Then I would you were so honest a man.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Honest, my lord!
Dialogue#HAMLET=Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
Dialogue#HAMLET=one man picked out of ten thousand.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=That's very true, my lord.

Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=What is the matter, my lord?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Between who?
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
Dialogue#HAMLET=that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
Dialogue#HAMLET=wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
Dialogue#HAMLET=plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
Dialogue#HAMLET=wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
Dialogue#HAMLET=though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
Dialogue#HAMLET=I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
Dialogue#HAMLET=yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
Dialogue#HAMLET=you could go backward.

Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Nor the soles of her shoe?

Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=We think not so, my lord.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
Dialogue#HAMLET=either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
Dialogue#HAMLET=it is a prison.
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=narrow for your mind.
Dialogue#HAMLET=O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
Dialogue#HAMLET=myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
Dialogue#HAMLET=have bad dreams.
Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
Dialogue#HAMLET=A dream itself is but a shadow.
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
Dialogue#HAMLET=outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
Dialogue#HAMLET=to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=We'll wait upon you.
Dialogue#HAMLET=No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
Dialogue#HAMLET=of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
Dialogue#HAMLET=man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
Dialogue#HAMLET=beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
Dialogue#HAMLET=thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
Dialogue#HAMLET=too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
Dialogue#HAMLET=your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
Dialogue#HAMLET=deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=What should we say, my lord?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
Dialogue#HAMLET=for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
Dialogue#HAMLET=which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
Dialogue#HAMLET=I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=To what end, my lord?
Dialogue#HAMLET=That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
Dialogue#HAMLET=the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
Dialogue#HAMLET=our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
Dialogue#HAMLET=love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
Dialogue#HAMLET=charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
Dialogue#HAMLET=whether you were sent for, or no?
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=[Aside to GUILDENSTERN]  What say you?
Dialogue#HAMLET=[Aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
Dialogue#HAMLET=love me, hold not off.
Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=My lord, we were sent for.
Dialogue#HAMLET=I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
Dialogue#HAMLET=prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
Dialogue#HAMLET=and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
Dialogue#HAMLET=wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
Dialogue#HAMLET=custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
Dialogue#HAMLET=with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
Dialogue#HAMLET=earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
Dialogue#HAMLET=excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
Dialogue#HAMLET=o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
Dialogue#HAMLET=with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
Dialogue#HAMLET=me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
Dialogue#HAMLET=What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
Dialogue#HAMLET=how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
Dialogue#HAMLET=express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
Dialogue#HAMLET=in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
Dialogue#HAMLET=world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
Dialogue#HAMLET=what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
Dialogue#HAMLET=me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
Dialogue#HAMLET=you seem to say so.
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=coming, to offer you service.
Dialogue#HAMLET=He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
Dialogue#HAMLET=shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
Dialogue#HAMLET=shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
Dialogue#HAMLET=sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
Dialogue#HAMLET=in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
Dialogue#HAMLET=lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
Dialogue#HAMLET=say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
Dialogue#HAMLET=for't. What players are they?
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=tragedians of the city.
Dialogue#HAMLET=How chances it they travel? their residence, both
Dialogue#HAMLET=in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=late innovation.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
Dialogue#HAMLET=in the city? are they so followed?
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=No, indeed, are they not.
Dialogue#HAMLET=How comes it? do they grow rusty?
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=that cry out on the top of question, and are most
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
Dialogue#HAMLET=What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
Dialogue#HAMLET=they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
Dialogue#HAMLET=longer than they can sing? will they not say
Dialogue#HAMLET=afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
Dialogue#HAMLET=players--as it is most like, if their means are no
Dialogue#HAMLET=better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
Dialogue#HAMLET=exclaim against their own succession?
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ='Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=cuffs in the question.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Is't possible?
Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Do the boys carry it away?
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
Dialogue#HAMLET=It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
Dialogue#HAMLET=Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
Dialogue#HAMLET=my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
Dialogue#HAMLET=hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
Dialogue#HAMLET='Sblood, there is something in this more than
Dialogue#HAMLET=natural, if philosophy could find it out.
Notice#Flourish of trumpets within
Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=There are the players.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
Dialogue#HAMLET=come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
Dialogue#HAMLET=and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
Dialogue#HAMLET=lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
Dialogue#HAMLET=must show fairly outward, should more appear like
Dialogue#HAMLET=entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
Dialogue#HAMLET=uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=In what, my dear lord?
Dialogue#HAMLET=I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
Dialogue#HAMLET=southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
Notice#Enter POLONIUS
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Well be with you, gentlemen!
Dialogue#HAMLET=Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
Dialogue#HAMLET=hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
Dialogue#HAMLET=out of his swaddling-clouts.
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=say an old man is twice a child.
Dialogue#HAMLET=I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
Dialogue#HAMLET=mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
Dialogue#HAMLET='twas so indeed.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=My lord, I have news to tell you.
Dialogue#HAMLET=My lord, I have news to tell you.
Dialogue#HAMLET=When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=The actors are come hither, my lord.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Buz, buz!
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Upon mine honour,--
Dialogue#HAMLET=Then came each actor on his ass,--
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=liberty, these are the only men.
Dialogue#HAMLET=O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=What a treasure had he, my lord?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Why,
Dialogue#HAMLET='One fair daughter and no more,
Dialogue#HAMLET=The which he loved passing well.'
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=[Aside]  Still on my daughter.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=that I love passing well.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Nay, that follows not.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=What follows, then, my lord?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Why,
Dialogue#HAMLET='As by lot, God wot,'
Dialogue#HAMLET=and then, you know,
Dialogue#HAMLET='It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
Dialogue#HAMLET=the first row of the pious chanson will show you
Dialogue#HAMLET=more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
Notice#Enter four or five Players
Dialogue#HAMLET=You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
Dialogue#HAMLET=to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
Dialogue#HAMLET=friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
Dialogue#HAMLET=comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
Dialogue#HAMLET=lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
Dialogue#HAMLET=nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
Dialogue#HAMLET=altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
Dialogue#HAMLET=apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
Dialogue#HAMLET=ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
Dialogue#HAMLET=to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
Dialogue#HAMLET=we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
Dialogue#HAMLET=of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
Dialogue#First Player=What speech, my lord?
Dialogue#HAMLET=I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
Dialogue#HAMLET=never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
Dialogue#HAMLET=play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
Dialogue#HAMLET=caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
Dialogue#HAMLET=it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
Dialogue#HAMLET=cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
Dialogue#HAMLET=digested in the scenes, set down with as much
Dialogue#HAMLET=modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
Dialogue#HAMLET=were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
Dialogue#HAMLET=savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
Dialogue#HAMLET=indict the author of affectation; but called it an
Dialogue#HAMLET=honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
Dialogue#HAMLET=much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
Dialogue#HAMLET=chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
Dialogue#HAMLET=thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
Dialogue#HAMLET=Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
Dialogue#HAMLET=at this line: let me see, let me see--
Dialogue#HAMLET='The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
Dialogue#HAMLET=it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
Dialogue#HAMLET='The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
Dialogue#HAMLET=When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
Dialogue#HAMLET=With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
Dialogue#HAMLET=Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
Dialogue#HAMLET=With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
Dialogue#HAMLET=That lend a tyrannous and damned light
Dialogue#HAMLET=To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
Dialogue#HAMLET=With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
Dialogue#HAMLET=Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
Dialogue#HAMLET=So, proceed you.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS='Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=good discretion.
Dialogue#First Player='Anon he finds him
Dialogue#First Player=Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
Dialogue#First Player=Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Dialogue#First Player=Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
Dialogue#First Player=Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
Dialogue#First Player=But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
Dialogue#First Player=The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
Dialogue#First Player=Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
Dialogue#First Player=Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Dialogue#First Player=Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
Dialogue#First Player=Which was declining on the milky head
Dialogue#First Player=Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
Dialogue#First Player=So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
Dialogue#First Player=And like a neutral to his will and matter,
Dialogue#First Player=Did nothing.
Dialogue#First Player=But, as we often see, against some storm,
Dialogue#First Player=A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
Dialogue#First Player=The bold winds speechless and the orb below
Dialogue#First Player=As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
Dialogue#First Player=Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
Dialogue#First Player=Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
Dialogue#First Player=And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
Dialogue#First Player=On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
Dialogue#First Player=With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
Dialogue#First Player=Now falls on Priam.
Dialogue#First Player=Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
Dialogue#First Player=In general synod 'take away her power;
Dialogue#First Player=Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
Dialogue#First Player=And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
Dialogue#First Player=As low as to the fiends!'
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=This is too long.
Dialogue#HAMLET=It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
Dialogue#HAMLET=say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
Dialogue#HAMLET=sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.
Dialogue#First Player='But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
Dialogue#HAMLET='The mobled queen?'
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
Dialogue#First Player='Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
Dialogue#First Player=With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
Dialogue#First Player=Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
Dialogue#First Player=About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
Dialogue#First Player=A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
Dialogue#First Player=Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
Dialogue#First Player='Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
Dialogue#First Player=pronounced:
Dialogue#First Player=But if the gods themselves did see her then
Dialogue#First Player=When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
Dialogue#First Player=In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
Dialogue#First Player=The instant burst of clamour that she made,
Dialogue#First Player=Unless things mortal move them not at all,
Dialogue#First Player=Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
Dialogue#First Player=And passion in the gods.'
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
Dialogue#HAMLET='Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Good my lord, will you see the players well
Dialogue#HAMLET=bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
Dialogue#HAMLET=they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
Dialogue#HAMLET=time: after your death you were better have a bad
Dialogue#HAMLET=epitaph than their ill report while you live.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
Dialogue#HAMLET=God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
Dialogue#HAMLET=after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
Dialogue#HAMLET=they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Take them in.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=Come, sirs.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
Notice#Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First
Dialogue#HAMLET=Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
Dialogue#HAMLET=Murder of Gonzago?
Dialogue#First Player=Ay, my lord.
Dialogue#HAMLET=We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
Dialogue#HAMLET=study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
Dialogue#HAMLET=I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
Dialogue#First Player=Ay, my lord.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
Dialogue#HAMLET=not.
Notice#Exit First Player
Dialogue#HAMLET=My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
Dialogue#HAMLET=welcome to Elsinore.
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=Good my lord!
Dialogue#HAMLET=Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
Notice#Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
Dialogue#HAMLET=Now I am alone.
Dialogue#HAMLET=O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Dialogue#HAMLET=Is it not monstrous that this player here,
Dialogue#HAMLET=But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Could force his soul so to his own conceit
Dialogue#HAMLET=That from her working all his visage wann'd,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
Dialogue#HAMLET=A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
Dialogue#HAMLET=With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
Dialogue#HAMLET=For Hecuba!
Dialogue#HAMLET=What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
Dialogue#HAMLET=That he should weep for her? What would he do,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Had he the motive and the cue for passion
Dialogue#HAMLET=That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
Dialogue#HAMLET=And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
Dialogue#HAMLET=The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
Dialogue#HAMLET=A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Upon whose property and most dear life
Dialogue#HAMLET=A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
Dialogue#HAMLET=As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Ha!
Dialogue#HAMLET='Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
Dialogue#HAMLET=But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
Dialogue#HAMLET=To make oppression bitter, or ere this
Dialogue#HAMLET=I should have fatted all the region kites
Dialogue#HAMLET=With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
Dialogue#HAMLET=Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
Dialogue#HAMLET=O, vengeance!
Dialogue#HAMLET=Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
Dialogue#HAMLET=That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
Dialogue#HAMLET=A scullion!
Dialogue#HAMLET=Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
Dialogue#HAMLET=That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Dialogue#HAMLET=Have by the very cunning of the scene
Dialogue#HAMLET=Been struck so to the soul that presently
Dialogue#HAMLET=They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
Dialogue#HAMLET=For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
Dialogue#HAMLET=With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
Dialogue#HAMLET=Play something like the murder of my father
Dialogue#HAMLET=Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
Dialogue#HAMLET=I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
Dialogue#HAMLET=I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
Dialogue#HAMLET=May be the devil: and the devil hath power
Dialogue#HAMLET=To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
Dialogue#HAMLET=Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
Dialogue#HAMLET=As he is very potent with such spirits,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
Dialogue#HAMLET=More relative than this: the play 's the thing
Dialogue#HAMLET=Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

Notice#Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=He does confess he feels himself distracted;
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=But from what cause he will by no means speak.
Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=When we would bring him on to some confession
Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=Of his true state.
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=                  Did he receive you well?
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=Most like a gentleman.
Dialogue#GUILDENSTERN=But with much forcing of his disposition.
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=Most free in his reply.
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Did you assay him?
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=To any pastime?
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=And there did seem in him a kind of joy
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=To hear of it: they are about the court,
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=And, as I think, they have already order
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=This night to play before him.
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS='Tis most true:
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=To hear and see the matter.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=With all my heart; and it doth much content me
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=To hear him so inclined.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And drive his purpose on to these delights.
Dialogue#ROSENCRANTZ=We shall, my lord.
Notice#Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=                  Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Affront Ophelia:
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Her father and myself, lawful espials,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=We may of their encounter frankly judge,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And gather by him, as he is behaved,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=If 't be the affliction of his love or no

Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=I shall obey you.
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish

Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=The devil himself.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=[Aside]          O, 'tis too true!
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Than is my deed to my most painted word:

Dialogue#LORD POLONIUS=I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
Notice#Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS
Notice#Enter HAMLET
Dialogue#HAMLET=To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Dialogue#HAMLET=Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
Dialogue#HAMLET=The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
Dialogue#HAMLET=No more; and by a sleep to say we end
Dialogue#HAMLET=The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
Dialogue#HAMLET=That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Dialogue#HAMLET=Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
Dialogue#HAMLET=To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
Dialogue#HAMLET=For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
Dialogue#HAMLET=When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Must give us pause: there's the respect
Dialogue#HAMLET=That makes calamity of so long life;
Dialogue#HAMLET=For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Dialogue#HAMLET=The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
Dialogue#HAMLET=The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
Dialogue#HAMLET=The insolence of office and the spurns
Dialogue#HAMLET=That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
Dialogue#HAMLET=When he himself might his quietus make
Dialogue#HAMLET=With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
Dialogue#HAMLET=To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
Dialogue#HAMLET=But that the dread of something after death,
Dialogue#HAMLET=The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
Dialogue#HAMLET=No traveller returns, puzzles the will
Dialogue#HAMLET=And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Dialogue#HAMLET=Than fly to others that we know not of?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
Dialogue#HAMLET=And thus the native hue of resolution
Dialogue#HAMLET=Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And enterprises of great pith and moment
Dialogue#HAMLET=With this regard their currents turn awry,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
Dialogue#HAMLET=The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Dialogue#HAMLET=Be all my sins remember'd.
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Good my lord,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=How does your honour for this many a day?
Dialogue#HAMLET=I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
Dialogue#OPHELIA=My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=That I have longed long to re-deliver;
Dialogue#OPHELIA=I pray you, now receive them.
Dialogue#HAMLET=No, not I;
Dialogue#HAMLET=I never gave you aught.
Dialogue#OPHELIA=My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
Dialogue#OPHELIA=And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
Dialogue#OPHELIA=As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Take these again; for to the noble mind
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
Dialogue#OPHELIA=There, my lord.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Ha, ha! are you honest?
Dialogue#OPHELIA=My lord?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Are you fair?
Dialogue#OPHELIA=What means your lordship?
Dialogue#HAMLET=That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
Dialogue#HAMLET=admit no discourse to your beauty.
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
Dialogue#OPHELIA=with honesty?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
Dialogue#HAMLET=transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
Dialogue#HAMLET=force of honesty can translate beauty into his
Dialogue#HAMLET=likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
Dialogue#HAMLET=time gives it proof. I did love you once.
Dialogue#OPHELIA=Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
Dialogue#HAMLET=You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
Dialogue#HAMLET=so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
Dialogue#HAMLET=it: I loved you not.

Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his  crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's  ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King  dead, and makes passionate action.

Dialogue#Player Queen=   So many journeys may the sun and moon
Dialogue#Player Queen=Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
Dialogue#Player Queen=But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
Dialogue#Player Queen=So far from cheer and from your former state,
Dialogue#Player Queen=That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Dialogue#Player Queen=Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
Dialogue#Player Queen=For women's fear and love holds quantity;
Dialogue#Player Queen=In neither aught, or in extremity.
Dialogue#Player Queen=Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
Dialogue#Player Queen=And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
Dialogue#Player Queen=Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Dialogue#Player Queen=Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
Dialogue#Player King='Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;

Dialogue#HAMLET=[Aside]  Wormwood, wormwood.

Dialogue#Player King=Of violent birth, but poor validity;
Dialogue#Player King=Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
Dialogue#Player King=But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
Dialogue#Player King=Most necessary 'tis that we forget
Dialogue#Player King=To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
Dialogue#Player King=What to ourselves in passion we propose,
Dialogue#Player King=The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
Dialogue#Player King=The violence of either grief or joy
Dialogue#Player King=Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Dialogue#Player King=Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Dialogue#Player King=Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
Dialogue#Player King=This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
Dialogue#Player King=That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
Dialogue#Player King=For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
Dialogue#Player King=Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
Dialogue#Player King=The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
Dialogue#Player King=The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
Dialogue#Player King=And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
Dialogue#Player King=For who not needs shall never lack a friend,

Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=What do you call the play?
Dialogue#HAMLET=The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play

Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=In noise so rude against me?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Such an act
Dialogue#HAMLET=That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
Dialogue#HAMLET=From the fair forehead of an innocent love
Dialogue#HAMLET=And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows

Dialogue#HAMLET=As from the body of contraction plucks
Dialogue#HAMLET=The very soul, and sweet religion makes
Dialogue#HAMLET=A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:

Dialogue#HAMLET=Is thought-sick at the act.
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Ay me, what act,
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
Dialogue#HAMLET=The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
Dialogue#HAMLET=See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
Dialogue#HAMLET=Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
Dialogue#HAMLET=An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
Dialogue#HAMLET=A station like the herald Mercury
Dialogue#HAMLET=New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
Dialogue#HAMLET=A combination and a form indeed,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Where every god did seem to set his seal,
Dialogue#HAMLET=To give the world assurance of a man:
Dialogue#HAMLET=This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
Dialogue#HAMLET=Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,

Dialogue#HAMLET=The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
Dialogue#HAMLET=Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
Dialogue#HAMLET=Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
Dialogue#HAMLET=But it reserved some quantity of choice,
Dialogue#HAMLET=To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
Dialogue#HAMLET=That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Dialogue#HAMLET=Could not so mope.
Dialogue#HAMLET=O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
Dialogue#HAMLET=If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
Dialogue#HAMLET=To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
Dialogue#HAMLET=When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,

Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=O Hamlet, speak no more:
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=And there I see such black and grained spots
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=As will not leave their tinct.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Nay, but to live
Dialogue#HAMLET=In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,

Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=O, speak to me no more;

Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=No more, sweet Hamlet!
Dialogue#HAMLET=A murderer and a villain;
Dialogue#HAMLET=A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe

Dialogue#HAMLET=How is it with you, lady?
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Alas, how is't with you,
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=That you do bend your eye on vacancy
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,

Dialogue#HAMLET=On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
Dialogue#HAMLET=His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
Dialogue#HAMLET=Lest with this piteous action you convert
Dialogue#HAMLET=My stern effects: then what I have to do
Dialogue#HAMLET=Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=To whom do you speak this?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Do you see nothing there?
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Nor did you nothing hear?
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=No, nothing but ourselves.

Dialogue#HAMLET=And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
Dialogue#HAMLET=That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And I the matter will re-word; which madness
Dialogue#HAMLET=Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
Dialogue#HAMLET=That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
Dialogue#HAMLET=It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
Dialogue#HAMLET=Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
Dialogue#HAMLET=And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
Dialogue#HAMLET=To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
Dialogue#HAMLET=For in the fatness of these pursy times
Dialogue#HAMLET=Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
Dialogue#HAMLET=O, throw away the worser part of it,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And live the purer with the other half.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
Dialogue#HAMLET=Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
Dialogue#HAMLET=That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
Dialogue#HAMLET=That to the use of actions fair and good
Dialogue#HAMLET=He likewise gives a frock or livery,
Dialogue#HAMLET=That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And that shall lend a kind of easiness
Dialogue#HAMLET=To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
Dialogue#HAMLET=For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And either [         ] the devil, or throw him out
Dialogue#HAMLET=With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
Dialogue#HAMLET=And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
Dialogue#HAMLET=I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
Notice#Pointing to POLONIUS
Dialogue#HAMLET=I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
Dialogue#HAMLET=To punish me with this and this with me,
Dialogue#HAMLET=That I must be their scourge and minister.
Dialogue#HAMLET=I will bestow him, and will answer well
Dialogue#HAMLET=The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
Dialogue#HAMLET=I must be cruel, only to be kind:
Dialogue#HAMLET=Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
Dialogue#HAMLET=One word more, good lady.
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=What shall I do?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Dialogue#HAMLET=Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Dialogue#HAMLET=Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
Dialogue#HAMLET=And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Make you to ravel all this matter out,

Dialogue#HAMLET=But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;

Dialogue#HAMLET=Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
Dialogue#HAMLET=No, in despite of sense and secrecy,

Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=What thou hast said to me.
Dialogue#HAMLET=I must to England; you know that?
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Alack,

Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS='High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.'
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
Dialogue#LAERTES=Know you the hand?
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS='Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!

Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Can you advise me?
Dialogue#LAERTES=I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
Dialogue#LAERTES=It warms the very sickness in my heart,
Dialogue#LAERTES=That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
Dialogue#LAERTES='Thus didest thou.'
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=If it be so, Laertes--
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Will you be ruled by me?
Dialogue#LAERTES=Ay, my lord;
Dialogue#LAERTES=So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,

Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=No more to undertake it, I will work him
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And call it accident.
Dialogue#LAERTES=My lord, I will be ruled;
Dialogue#LAERTES=The rather, if you could devise it so
Dialogue#LAERTES=That I might be the organ.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=It falls right.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Did not together pluck such envy from him
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=As did that one, and that, in my regard,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Of the unworthiest siege.
Dialogue#LAERTES=What part is that, my lord?
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=A very riband in the cap of youth,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=The light and careless livery that it wears
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Come short of what he did.
Dialogue#LAERTES=A Norman was't?
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=A Norman.
Dialogue#LAERTES=Upon my life, Lamond.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=The very same.
Dialogue#LAERTES=I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
Dialogue#LAERTES=And gem of all the nation.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=He made confession of you,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And gave you such a masterly report
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=For art and exercise in your defence
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And for your rapier most especially,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=That he could nothing do but wish and beg
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Now, out of this,--
Dialogue#LAERTES=What out of this, my lord?
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=A face without a heart?
Dialogue#LAERTES=Why ask you this?
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Not that I think you did not love your father;
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=But that I know love is begun by time;
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And that I see, in passages of proof,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=There lives within the very flame of love
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And nothing is at a like goodness still;
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Dies in his own too much: that we would do
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And hath abatements and delays as many
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=To show yourself your father's son in deed
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=More than in words?
Dialogue#LAERTES=To cut his throat i' the church.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And set a double varnish on the fame
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Most generous and free from all contriving,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Requite him for your father.
Dialogue#LAERTES=I will do't:
Dialogue#LAERTES=And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
Dialogue#LAERTES=I bought an unction of a mountebank,
Dialogue#LAERTES=So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
Dialogue#LAERTES=Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
Dialogue#LAERTES=Collected from all simples that have virtue
Dialogue#LAERTES=Under the moon, can save the thing from death
Dialogue#LAERTES=That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
Dialogue#LAERTES=With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
Dialogue#LAERTES=It may be death.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=                  Let's further think of this;
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Weigh what convenience both of time and means
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And that our drift look through our bad performance,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS='Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=Should have a back or second, that might hold,
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=When in your motion you are hot and dry--
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=As make your bouts more violent to that end--
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,

Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=There with fantastic garlands did she come
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples

Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:

Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=When down her weedy trophies and herself
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;

Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Drown'd, drown'd.
Dialogue#LAERTES=Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
Dialogue#LAERTES=And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
Dialogue#LAERTES=It is our trick; nature her custom holds,

Dialogue#First Clown=How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her

Dialogue#Second Clown=Why, 'tis found so.
Dialogue#First Clown=It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
Dialogue#First Clown=here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,
Dialogue#First Clown=it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
Dialogue#First Clown=is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
Dialogue#First Clown=herself wittingly.
Dialogue#Second Clown=Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--

Dialogue#Second Clown=Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been

Dialogue#First Clown=Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
Dialogue#First Clown=great folk should have countenance in this world to
Dialogue#First Clown=drown or hang themselves, more than their even
Dialogue#First Clown=Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient

Dialogue#Second Clown=Go to.
Dialogue#First Clown=What is he that builds stronger than either the
Dialogue#First Clown=mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
Dialogue#Second Clown=The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a

Dialogue#First Clown=I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
Dialogue#First Clown=does well; but how does it well? it does well to
Dialogue#First Clown=those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the

Dialogue#HAMLET=Why I will fight with him upon this theme
Dialogue#HAMLET=Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=O my son, what theme?
Dialogue#HAMLET=I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
Dialogue#HAMLET=Could not, with all their quantity of love,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
Dialogue#KING CLAUDIUS=O, he is mad, Laertes.
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=For love of God, forbear him.
Dialogue#HAMLET='Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
Dialogue#HAMLET=Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
Dialogue#HAMLET=I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
Dialogue#HAMLET=To outface me with leaping in her grave?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
Dialogue#HAMLET=And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
Dialogue#HAMLET=Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
Dialogue#HAMLET=I'll rant as well as thou.
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=This is mere madness:
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=Anon, as patient as the female dove,
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
Dialogue#QUEEN GERTRUDE=His silence will sit drooping.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Hear you, sir;
Dialogue#HAMLET=What is the reason that you use me thus?
Dialogue#HAMLET=I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
Dialogue#HAMLET=Let Hercules himself do what he may,

Notice#Enter HAMLET and HORATIO
Dialogue#HAMLET=So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
Dialogue#HAMLET=You do remember all the circumstance?
Dialogue#HORATIO=Remember it, my lord?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
Dialogue#HAMLET=That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
Dialogue#HAMLET=Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
Dialogue#HAMLET=When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
Dialogue#HAMLET=There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Rough-hew them how we will,--
Dialogue#HORATIO=That is most certain.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Up from my cabin,
Dialogue#HAMLET=My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
Dialogue#HAMLET=Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
Dialogue#HAMLET=To mine own room again; making so bold,
Dialogue#HAMLET=My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
Dialogue#HAMLET=Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
Dialogue#HAMLET=O royal knavery!--an exact command,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Dialogue#HAMLET=Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
Dialogue#HAMLET=With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
Dialogue#HAMLET=That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
Dialogue#HAMLET=No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
Dialogue#HAMLET=My head should be struck off.
Dialogue#HORATIO=Is't possible?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
Dialogue#HAMLET=But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
Dialogue#HORATIO=I beseech you.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
Dialogue#HAMLET=Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
Dialogue#HAMLET=They had begun the play--I sat me down,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
Dialogue#HAMLET=I once did hold it, as our statists do,
Dialogue#HAMLET=A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
Dialogue#HAMLET=How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
Dialogue#HAMLET=It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
Dialogue#HAMLET=The effect of what I wrote?
Dialogue#HORATIO=Ay, good my lord.
Dialogue#HAMLET=An earnest conjuration from the king,
Dialogue#HAMLET=As England was his faithful tributary,
Dialogue#HAMLET=As love between them like the palm might flourish,
Dialogue#HAMLET=As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
Dialogue#HAMLET=And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
Dialogue#HAMLET=That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Without debatement further, more or less,
Dialogue#HAMLET=He should the bearers put to sudden death,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Not shriving-time allow'd.
Dialogue#HORATIO=How was this seal'd?
Dialogue#HAMLET=Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
Dialogue#HAMLET=I had my father's signet in my purse,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Which was the model of that Danish seal;
Dialogue#HAMLET=Folded the writ up in form of the other,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
Dialogue#HAMLET=The changeling never known. Now, the next day
Dialogue#HAMLET=Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
Dialogue#HAMLET=Thou know'st already.
Dialogue#HORATIO=So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
Dialogue#HAMLET=They are not near my conscience; their defeat
Dialogue#HAMLET=Does by their own insinuation grow:
Dialogue#HAMLET='Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
Dialogue#HAMLET=Between the pass and fell incensed points
Dialogue#HAMLET=Of mighty opposites.
Dialogue#HORATIO=Why, what a king is this!
Dialogue#HAMLET=Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
Dialogue#HAMLET=He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
Dialogue#HAMLET=To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
Dialogue#HAMLET=To let this canker of our nature come
Dialogue#HAMLET=In further evil?
Dialogue#HORATIO=It must be shortly known to him from England
Dialogue#HORATIO=What is the issue of the business there.
Dialogue#HAMLET=It will be short: the interim is mine;
Dialogue#HAMLET=And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
Dialogue#HAMLET=But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
Dialogue#HAMLET=That to Laertes I forgot myself;
Dialogue#HAMLET=For, by the image of my cause, I see
Dialogue#HAMLET=The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
Dialogue#HAMLET=But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
Dialogue#HAMLET=Into a towering passion.
Dialogue#HORATIO=Peace! who comes here?
Notice#Enter OSRIC
Dialogue#OSRIC=Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
Dialogue#HAMLET=I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
Dialogue#HORATIO=No, my good lord.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
Dialogue#HAMLET=know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
Dialogue#HAMLET=beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
Dialogue#HAMLET=the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
Dialogue#HAMLET=spacious in the possession of dirt.
Dialogue#OSRIC=Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
Dialogue#OSRIC=should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
Dialogue#HAMLET=I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
Dialogue#HAMLET=spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
Dialogue#OSRIC=I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
Dialogue#HAMLET=No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
Dialogue#HAMLET=northerly.
Dialogue#OSRIC=It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
Dialogue#HAMLET=But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
Dialogue#HAMLET=complexion.
Dialogue#OSRIC=Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
Dialogue#OSRIC='twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
Dialogue#OSRIC=majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
Dialogue#OSRIC=great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--
Dialogue#HAMLET=I beseech you, remember--
Notice#HAMLET moves him to put on his hat
Dialogue#OSRIC=Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
Dialogue#OSRIC=Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
Dialogue#OSRIC=me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
Dialogue#OSRIC=differences, of very soft society and great showing:
Dialogue#OSRIC=indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
Dialogue#OSRIC=calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
Dialogue#OSRIC=continent of what part a gentleman would see.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
Dialogue#HAMLET=though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
Dialogue#HAMLET=dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
Dialogue#HAMLET=neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
Dialogue#HAMLET=verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
Dialogue#HAMLET=great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
Dialogue#HAMLET=rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
Dialogue#HAMLET=semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
Dialogue#HAMLET=him, his umbrage, nothing more.
Dialogue#OSRIC=Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
Dialogue#HAMLET=The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
Dialogue#HAMLET=in our more rawer breath?
Dialogue#OSRIC=Sir?
Dialogue#HORATIO=Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
Dialogue#HORATIO=You will do't, sir, really.
Dialogue#HAMLET=What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
Dialogue#OSRIC=Of Laertes?
Dialogue#HORATIO=His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Of him, sir.
Dialogue#OSRIC=I know you are not ignorant--
Dialogue#HAMLET=I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
Dialogue#HAMLET=it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
Dialogue#OSRIC=You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
Dialogue#HAMLET=I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
Dialogue#HAMLET=him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
Dialogue#HAMLET=know himself.
Dialogue#OSRIC=I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
Dialogue#OSRIC=laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
Dialogue#HAMLET=What's his weapon?
Dialogue#OSRIC=Rapier and dagger.
Dialogue#HAMLET=That's two of his weapons: but, well.
Dialogue#OSRIC=The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
Dialogue#OSRIC=horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
Dialogue#OSRIC=it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
Dialogue#OSRIC=assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
Dialogue#OSRIC=carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
Dialogue#OSRIC=responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
Dialogue#OSRIC=and of very liberal conceit.
Dialogue#HAMLET=What call you the carriages?
Dialogue#HORATIO=I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
Dialogue#OSRIC=The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
Dialogue#HAMLET=The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
Dialogue#HAMLET=could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
Dialogue#HAMLET=be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
Dialogue#HAMLET=against six French swords, their assigns, and three
Dialogue#HAMLET=liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
Dialogue#HAMLET=against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
Dialogue#OSRIC=The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
Dialogue#OSRIC=between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
Dialogue#OSRIC=three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
Dialogue#OSRIC=would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
Dialogue#OSRIC=would vouchsafe the answer.
Dialogue#HAMLET=How if I answer 'no'?
Dialogue#OSRIC=I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
Dialogue#HAMLET=majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
Dialogue#HAMLET=the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
Dialogue#HAMLET=king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
Dialogue#HAMLET=if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
Dialogue#OSRIC=Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
Dialogue#HAMLET=To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
Dialogue#OSRIC=I commend my duty to your lordship.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Yours, yours.
Notice#Exit OSRIC
Dialogue#HAMLET=He does well to commend it himself; there are no
Dialogue#HAMLET=tongues else for's turn.
Dialogue#HORATIO=This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
Dialogue#HAMLET=He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
Dialogue#HAMLET=know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
Dialogue#HAMLET=the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
Dialogue#HAMLET=yesty collection, which carries them through and
Dialogue#HAMLET=through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
Dialogue#HAMLET=but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
Notice#Enter a Lord
Dialogue#Lord=My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
Dialogue#Lord=Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
Dialogue#Lord=the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
Dialogue#Lord=play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
Dialogue#HAMLET=I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
Dialogue#HAMLET=pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
Dialogue#HAMLET=or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
Dialogue#Lord=The king and queen and all are coming down.
Dialogue#HAMLET=In happy time.
Dialogue#Lord=The queen desires you to use some gentle
Dialogue#Lord=entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
Dialogue#HAMLET=She well instructs me.
Notice#Exit Lord
Dialogue#HORATIO=You will lose this wager, my lord.
Dialogue#HAMLET=I do not think so: since he went into France, I
Dialogue#HAMLET=have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
Dialogue#HAMLET=odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
Dialogue#HAMLET=about my heart: but it is no matter.
Dialogue#HORATIO=Nay, good my lord,--
Dialogue#HAMLET=It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
Dialogue#HAMLET=gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
Dialogue#HORATIO=If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
Dialogue#HORATIO=forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
Dialogue#HORATIO=fit.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
Dialogue#HAMLET=providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
Dialogue#HAMLET='tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
Dialogue#HAMLET=now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the

Dialogue#HAMLET=And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
Dialogue#HAMLET=With sore distraction. What I have done,
Dialogue#HAMLET=That might your nature, honour and exception
Dialogue#HAMLET=Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
Dialogue#HAMLET=If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
Dialogue#HAMLET=And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
Dialogue#HAMLET=His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
Dialogue#HAMLET=Sir, in this audience,
Dialogue#HAMLET=Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Dialogue#HAMLET=Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,

Dialogue#HAMLET=And hurt my brother.
