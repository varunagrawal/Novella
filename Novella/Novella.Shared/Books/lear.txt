Banner#SCENE I. King Lear's palace.
Notice#Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND
Dialogue#KENT=I thought the king had more affected the Duke of
Dialogue#KENT=Albany than Cornwall.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=of either's moiety.
Dialogue#KENT=Is not this your son, my lord?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=brazed to it.
Dialogue#KENT=I cannot conceive you.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Do you smell a fault?
Dialogue#KENT=I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it
Dialogue#KENT=being so proper.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=though this knave came something saucily into the
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=noble gentleman, Edmund?
Dialogue#EDMUND=No, my lord.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=honourable friend.
Dialogue#EDMUND=My services to your lordship.
Dialogue#KENT=I must love you, and sue to know you better.
Dialogue#EDMUND=Sir, I shall study deserving.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=He hath been out nine years, and away he shall
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=again. The king is coming.
Notice#Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I shall, my liege.
Notice#Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
Dialogue#KING LEAR=In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
Dialogue#KING LEAR=To shake all cares and business from our age;
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=We have this hour a constant will to publish
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
Dialogue#KING LEAR=May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Since now we will divest us both of rule,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Interest of territory, cares of state,--
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
Dialogue#KING LEAR=That we our largest bounty may extend
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Our eldest-born, speak first.
Dialogue#GONERIL=Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
Dialogue#GONERIL=Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
Dialogue#GONERIL=Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
Dialogue#GONERIL=No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
Dialogue#GONERIL=As much as child e'er loved, or father found;
Dialogue#GONERIL=A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
Dialogue#GONERIL=Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
Dialogue#CORDELIA=[Aside]  What shall Cordelia do?
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Love, and be silent.
Dialogue#LEAR=Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
Dialogue#LEAR=With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
Dialogue#LEAR=With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
Dialogue#LEAR=We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
Dialogue#LEAR=Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
Dialogue#LEAR=Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
Dialogue#REGAN=Sir, I am made
Dialogue#REGAN=Of the self-same metal that my sister is,
Dialogue#REGAN=And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
Dialogue#REGAN=I find she names my very deed of love;
Dialogue#REGAN=Only she comes too short: that I profess
Dialogue#REGAN=Myself an enemy to all other joys,
Dialogue#REGAN=Which the most precious square of sense possesses;
Dialogue#REGAN=And find I am alone felicitate
Dialogue#REGAN=In your dear highness' love.
Dialogue#CORDELIA=[Aside]	Then poor Cordelia!
Dialogue#CORDELIA=And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
Dialogue#CORDELIA=More richer than my tongue.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=To thee and thine hereditary ever
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
Dialogue#KING LEAR=No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Although the last, not least; to whose young love
Dialogue#KING LEAR=The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
Dialogue#KING LEAR=A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Nothing, my lord.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Nothing!
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Nothing.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
Dialogue#CORDELIA=My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
Dialogue#CORDELIA=According to my bond; nor more nor less.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Lest it may mar your fortunes.
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Good my lord,
Dialogue#CORDELIA=You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Return those duties back as are right fit,
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
Dialogue#CORDELIA=They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
Dialogue#CORDELIA=That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
Dialogue#CORDELIA=To love my father all.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=But goes thy heart with this?
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Ay, good my lord.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=So young, and so untender?
Dialogue#CORDELIA=So young, my lord, and true.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:
Dialogue#KING LEAR=For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;
Dialogue#KING LEAR=By all the operation of the orbs
Dialogue#KING LEAR=From whom we do exist, and cease to be;
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Propinquity and property of blood,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=And as a stranger to my heart and me
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Or he that makes his generation messes
Dialogue#KING LEAR=To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=As thou my sometime daughter.
Dialogue#KENT=Good my liege,--
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Peace, Kent!
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
Dialogue#KING LEAR=On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
Dialogue#KING LEAR=So be my grave my peace, as here I give
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=I do invest you jointly with my power,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
Dialogue#KING LEAR=That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=With reservation of an hundred knights,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
Dialogue#KING LEAR=The name, and all the additions to a king;
Dialogue#KING LEAR=The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=This coronet part betwixt you.
Notice#Giving the crown
Dialogue#KENT=Royal Lear,
Dialogue#KENT=Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
Dialogue#KENT=Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,
Dialogue#KENT=As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--
Dialogue#KING LEAR=The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.
Dialogue#KENT=Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
Dialogue#KENT=The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,
Dialogue#KENT=When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?
Dialogue#KENT=Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,
Dialogue#KENT=When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,
Dialogue#KENT=When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;
Dialogue#KENT=And, in thy best consideration, cheque
Dialogue#KENT=This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
Dialogue#KENT=Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
Dialogue#KENT=Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
Dialogue#KENT=Reverbs no hollowness.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Kent, on thy life, no more.
Dialogue#KENT=My life I never held but as a pawn
Dialogue#KENT=To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,
Dialogue#KENT=Thy safety being the motive.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Out of my sight!
Dialogue#KENT=See better, Lear; and let me still remain
Dialogue#KENT=The true blank of thine eye.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Now, by Apollo,--
Dialogue#KENT=                  Now, by Apollo, king,
Dialogue#KENT=Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=O, vassal! miscreant!
Notice#Laying his hand on his sword
Dialogue#CORNWALL=Dear sir, forbear.
Dialogue#KENT=Do:
Dialogue#KENT=Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
Dialogue#KENT=Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;
Dialogue#KENT=Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
Dialogue#KENT=I'll tell thee thou dost evil.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Hear me, recreant!
Dialogue#KING LEAR=On thine allegiance, hear me!
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride
Dialogue#KING LEAR=To come between our sentence and our power,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Our potency made good, take thy reward.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Five days we do allot thee, for provision
Dialogue#KING LEAR=To shield thee from diseases of the world;
Dialogue#KING LEAR=And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=This shall not be revoked.
Dialogue#KENT=Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,
Dialogue#KENT=Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
Notice#To CORDELIA
Dialogue#KENT=The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
Dialogue#KENT=That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!
Notice#To REGAN and GONERIL
Dialogue#KENT=And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
Dialogue#KENT=That good effects may spring from words of love.
Dialogue#KENT=Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
Dialogue#KENT=He'll shape his old course in a country new.
Notice#Exit
Notice#Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE, BURGUNDY, and Attendants
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=My lord of Burgundy.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=We first address towards you, who with this king
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Will you require in present dower with her,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Or cease your quest of love?
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=Most royal majesty,
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=Nor will you tender less.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Right noble Burgundy,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
Dialogue#KING LEAR=But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
Dialogue#KING LEAR=If aught within that little seeming substance,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=She's there, and she is yours.
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=I know no answer.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Take her, or leave her?
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=Pardon me, royal sir;
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=Election makes not up on such conditions.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=I tell you all her wealth.
Notice#To KING OF FRANCE
Dialogue#KING LEAR=For you, great king,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=I would not from your love make such a stray,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
Dialogue#KING LEAR=To avert your liking a more worthier way
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Almost to acknowledge hers.
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=This is most strange,
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=That she, that even but now was your best object,
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Must be of such unnatural degree,
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Must be a faith that reason without miracle
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Could never plant in me.
Dialogue#CORDELIA=I yet beseech your majesty,--
Dialogue#CORDELIA=If for I want that glib and oily art,
Dialogue#CORDELIA=To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
Dialogue#CORDELIA=I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known
Dialogue#CORDELIA=It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
Dialogue#CORDELIA=No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
Dialogue#CORDELIA=That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;
Dialogue#CORDELIA=But even for want of that for which I am richer,
Dialogue#CORDELIA=A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
Dialogue#CORDELIA=As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Hath lost me in your liking.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Better thou
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Which often leaves the history unspoke
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=What say you to the lady? Love's not love
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=When it is mingled with regards that stand
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=She is herself a dowry.
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=Royal Lear,
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=Duchess of Burgundy.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=That you must lose a husband.
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Peace be with Burgundy!
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Since that respects of fortune are his love,
Dialogue#CORDELIA=I shall not be his wife.
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Thou losest here, a better where to find.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
Dialogue#KING LEAR=That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Without our grace, our love, our benison.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Come, noble Burgundy.
Notice#Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL, REGAN, and CORDELIA
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Bid farewell to your sisters.
Dialogue#CORDELIA=The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
Dialogue#CORDELIA=And like a sister am most loath to call
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:
Dialogue#CORDELIA=To your professed bosoms I commit him
Dialogue#CORDELIA=But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
Dialogue#CORDELIA=I would prefer him to a better place.
Dialogue#CORDELIA=So, farewell to you both.
Dialogue#REGAN=Prescribe not us our duties.
Dialogue#GONERIL=Let your study
Dialogue#GONERIL=Be to content your lord, who hath received you
Dialogue#GONERIL=At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
Dialogue#GONERIL=And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
Dialogue#CORDELIA=Well may you prosper!
Dialogue#KING OF FRANCE=Come, my fair Cordelia.
Notice#Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA
Dialogue#GONERIL=Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what
Dialogue#GONERIL=most nearly appertains to us both. I think our
Dialogue#GONERIL=father will hence to-night.
Dialogue#REGAN=That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.
Dialogue#GONERIL=You see how full of changes his age is; the
Dialogue#GONERIL=observation we have made of it hath not been
Dialogue#GONERIL=little: he always loved our sister most; and
Dialogue#GONERIL=with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
Dialogue#GONERIL=appears too grossly.
Dialogue#REGAN='Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever
Dialogue#REGAN=but slenderly known himself.
Dialogue#GONERIL=The best and soundest of his time hath been but
Dialogue#GONERIL=rash; then must we look to receive from his age,
Dialogue#GONERIL=not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed
Dialogue#GONERIL=condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
Dialogue#GONERIL=that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
Dialogue#REGAN=Such unconstant starts are we like to have from
Dialogue#REGAN=him as this of Kent's banishment.
Dialogue#GONERIL=There is further compliment of leavetaking
Dialogue#GONERIL=between France and him. Pray you, let's hit
Dialogue#GONERIL=together: if our father carry authority with
Dialogue#GONERIL=such dispositions as he bears, this last
Dialogue#GONERIL=surrender of his will but offend us.
Dialogue#REGAN=We shall further think on't.
Dialogue#GONERIL=We must do something, and i' the heat.
Notice#Exeunt

Notice#Enter EDMUND, with a letter
Dialogue#EDMUND=Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law
Dialogue#EDMUND=My services are bound. Wherefore should I
Dialogue#EDMUND=Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
Dialogue#EDMUND=The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
Dialogue#EDMUND=For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines
Dialogue#EDMUND=Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
Dialogue#EDMUND=When my dimensions are as well compact,
Dialogue#EDMUND=My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
Dialogue#EDMUND=As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
Dialogue#EDMUND=With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
Dialogue#EDMUND=Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
Dialogue#EDMUND=More composition and fierce quality
Dialogue#EDMUND=Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
Dialogue#EDMUND=Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
Dialogue#EDMUND=Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,
Dialogue#EDMUND=Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:
Dialogue#EDMUND=Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
Dialogue#EDMUND=As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!
Dialogue#EDMUND=Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
Dialogue#EDMUND=And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
Dialogue#EDMUND=Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:
Dialogue#EDMUND=Now, gods, stand up for bastards!
Notice#Enter GLOUCESTER
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Confined to exhibition! All this done
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?
Dialogue#EDMUND=So please your lordship, none.
Notice#Putting up the letter
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
Dialogue#EDMUND=I know no news, my lord.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=What paper were you reading?
Dialogue#EDMUND=Nothing, my lord.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.
Dialogue#EDMUND=I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter
Dialogue#EDMUND=from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;
Dialogue#EDMUND=and for so much as I have perused, I find it not
Dialogue#EDMUND=fit for your o'er-looking.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Give me the letter, sir.
Dialogue#EDMUND=I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The
Dialogue#EDMUND=contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Let's see, let's see.
Dialogue#EDMUND=I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote
Dialogue#EDMUND=this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=[Reads]  'This policy and reverence of age makes
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=me, that of this I may speak more. If our father
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=would sleep till I waked him, you should half his
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=brother,	EDGAR.'
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--you
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=should enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=to breed it in?--When came this to you? who
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=brought it?
Dialogue#EDMUND=It was not brought me, my lord; there's the
Dialogue#EDMUND=cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the
Dialogue#EDMUND=casement of my closet.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=You know the character to be your brother's?
Dialogue#EDMUND=If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear
Dialogue#EDMUND=it were his; but, in respect of that, I would
Dialogue#EDMUND=fain think it were not.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=It is his.
Dialogue#EDMUND=It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is
Dialogue#EDMUND=not in the contents.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?
Dialogue#EDMUND=Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft
Dialogue#EDMUND=maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,
Dialogue#EDMUND=and fathers declining, the father should be as
Dialogue#EDMUND=ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=O villain, villain! His very opinion in the
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Where is he?
Dialogue#EDMUND=I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please
Dialogue#EDMUND=you to suspend your indignation against my
Dialogue#EDMUND=brother till you can derive from him better
Dialogue#EDMUND=testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain
Dialogue#EDMUND=course; where, if you violently proceed against
Dialogue#EDMUND=him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great
Dialogue#EDMUND=gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the
Dialogue#EDMUND=heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
Dialogue#EDMUND=for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my
Dialogue#EDMUND=affection to your honour, and to no further
Dialogue#EDMUND=pretence of danger.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Think you so?
Dialogue#EDMUND=If your honour judge it meet, I will place you
Dialogue#EDMUND=where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an
Dialogue#EDMUND=auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and
Dialogue#EDMUND=that without any further delay than this very evening.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=He cannot be such a monster--
Dialogue#EDMUND=Nor is not, sure.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To his father, that so tenderly and entirely
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=business after your own wisdom. I would unstate
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=myself, to be in a due resolution.
Dialogue#EDMUND=I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the
Dialogue#EDMUND=business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=friendship falls off, brothers divide: in
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=and father. This villain of mine comes under the
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=prediction; there's son against father: the king
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=falls from bias of nature; there's father against
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=child. We have seen the best of our time:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.

Dialogue#EDMUND=This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,
Dialogue#EDMUND=when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit
Dialogue#EDMUND=of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our

Dialogue#EDMUND=if we were villains by necessity; fools by
Dialogue#EDMUND=heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and

Dialogue#KING LEAR=Why?
Dialogue#Fool=Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his
Dialogue#Fool=daughters, and leave his horns without a case.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my
Dialogue#KING LEAR=horses ready?
Dialogue#Fool=Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the
Dialogue#Fool=seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Because they are not eight?
Dialogue#Fool=Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!
Dialogue#Fool=If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten
Dialogue#Fool=for being old before thy time.

Dialogue#EDMUND=How comes that?
Dialogue#CURAN=Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;
Dialogue#CURAN=I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but
Dialogue#CURAN=ear-kissing arguments?
Dialogue#EDMUND=Not I	pray you, what are they?
Dialogue#CURAN=Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the

Dialogue#EDMUND=Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?

Dialogue#EDMUND=Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
Dialogue#EDMUND=To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
Dialogue#EDMUND=With his prepared sword, he charges home

Dialogue#EDMUND=Full suddenly he fled.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Let him fly far:

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;

Dialogue#REGAN=What, did my father's godson seek your life?
Dialogue#REGAN=He whom my father named? your Edgar?

Dialogue#REGAN=That tend upon my father?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.
Dialogue#EDMUND=Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
Dialogue#REGAN=No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:

Dialogue#REGAN=Wherein we must have use of your advice:
Dialogue#REGAN=Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
Dialogue#REGAN=Of differences, which I least thought it fit

Dialogue#OSWALD=Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
Dialogue#KENT=Fellow, I know thee.
Dialogue#OSWALD=What dost thou know me for?
Dialogue#KENT=A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a
Dialogue#KENT=base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,
Dialogue#KENT=hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a
Dialogue#KENT=lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,
Dialogue#KENT=glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;
Dialogue#KENT=one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a
Dialogue#KENT=bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but
Dialogue#KENT=the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,
Dialogue#KENT=and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I
Dialogue#KENT=will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest
Dialogue#KENT=the least syllable of thy addition.
Dialogue#OSWALD=Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail
Dialogue#OSWALD=on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!
Dialogue#KENT=What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou
Dialogue#KENT=knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up
Dialogue#KENT=thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you
Dialogue#KENT=rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon

Dialogue#KENT=draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.
Notice#Drawing his sword
Dialogue#OSWALD=Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
Dialogue#KENT=Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the

Dialogue#REGAN=The messengers from our sister and the king.
Dialogue#CORNWALL=What is your difference? speak.
Dialogue#OSWALD=I am scarce in breath, my lord.
Dialogue#KENT=No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You
Dialogue#KENT=cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a
Dialogue#KENT=tailor made thee.
Dialogue#CORNWALL=Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?
Dialogue#KENT=Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter could
Dialogue#KENT=not have made him so ill, though he had been but two
Dialogue#KENT=hours at the trade.
Dialogue#CORNWALL=Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?
Dialogue#OSWALD=This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared
Dialogue#OSWALD=at suit of his gray beard,--
Dialogue#KENT=Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My
Dialogue#KENT=lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this
Dialogue#KENT=unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of
Dialogue#KENT=a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?
Dialogue#CORNWALL=Peace, sirrah!
Dialogue#CORNWALL=You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
Dialogue#KENT=Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.
Dialogue#CORNWALL=Why art thou angry?
Dialogue#KENT=That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
Dialogue#KENT=Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
Dialogue#KENT=Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
Dialogue#KENT=Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
Dialogue#KENT=That in the natures of their lords rebel;
Dialogue#KENT=Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
Dialogue#KENT=Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
Dialogue#KENT=With every gale and vary of their masters,
Dialogue#KENT=Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
Dialogue#KENT=A plague upon your epileptic visage!
Dialogue#KENT=Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?

Dialogue#CORNWALL=Why, art thou mad, old fellow?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=How fell you out? say that.
Dialogue#KENT=No contraries hold more antipathy
Dialogue#KENT=Than I and such a knave.
Dialogue#CORNWALL=Why dost thou call him a knave?  What's his offence?
Dialogue#KENT=His countenance likes me not.
Dialogue#CORNWALL=No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.
Dialogue#KENT=Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:
Dialogue#KENT=I have seen better faces in my time
Dialogue#KENT=Than stands on any shoulder that I see
Dialogue#KENT=Before me at this instant.
Dialogue#CORNWALL=This is some fellow,
Dialogue#CORNWALL=Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect
Dialogue#CORNWALL=A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
Dialogue#CORNWALL=Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,
Dialogue#CORNWALL=An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!
Dialogue#CORNWALL=An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
Dialogue#CORNWALL=These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness
Dialogue#CORNWALL=Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
Dialogue#CORNWALL=Than twenty silly ducking observants
Dialogue#CORNWALL=That stretch their duties nicely.
Dialogue#KENT=Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,
Dialogue#KENT=Under the allowance of your great aspect,
Dialogue#KENT=Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
Dialogue#KENT=On flickering Phoebus' front,--
Dialogue#CORNWALL=What mean'st by this?
Dialogue#KENT=To go out of my dialect, which you
Dialogue#KENT=discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no
Dialogue#KENT=flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain
Dialogue#KENT=accent was a plain knave; which for my part
Dialogue#KENT=I will not be, though I should win your displeasure
Dialogue#KENT=to entreat me to 't.
Dialogue#CORNWALL=What was the offence you gave him?
Dialogue#OSWALD=I never gave him any:
Dialogue#OSWALD=It pleased the king his master very late
Dialogue#OSWALD=To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
Dialogue#OSWALD=When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,
Dialogue#OSWALD=Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
Dialogue#OSWALD=And put upon him such a deal of man,
Dialogue#OSWALD=That worthied him, got praises of the king
Dialogue#OSWALD=For him attempting who was self-subdued;
Dialogue#OSWALD=And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
Dialogue#OSWALD=Drew on me here again.
Dialogue#KENT=None of these rogues and cowards
Dialogue#KENT=But Ajax is their fool.
Dialogue#CORNWALL=Fetch forth the stocks!
Dialogue#CORNWALL=You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
Dialogue#CORNWALL=We'll teach you--
Dialogue#KENT=                  Sir, I am too old to learn:
Dialogue#KENT=Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;
Dialogue#KENT=On whose employment I was sent to you:
Dialogue#KENT=You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
Dialogue#KENT=Against the grace and person of my master,
Dialogue#KENT=Stocking his messenger.
Dialogue#CORNWALL=Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
Dialogue#CORNWALL=There shall he sit till noon.
Dialogue#REGAN=Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.
Dialogue#KENT=Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
Dialogue#KENT=You should not use me so.
Dialogue#REGAN=Sir, being his knave, I will.
Dialogue#CORNWALL=This is a fellow of the self-same colour
Dialogue#CORNWALL=Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!
Notice#Stocks brought out
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Let me beseech your grace not to do so:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=His fault is much, and the good king his master
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=For pilferings and most common trespasses
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Should have him thus restrain'd.
Dialogue#CORNWALL=I'll answer that.
Dialogue#REGAN=My sister may receive it much more worse,
Dialogue#REGAN=To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,
Dialogue#REGAN=For following her affairs. Put in his legs.
Notice#KENT is put in the stocks
Dialogue#REGAN=Come, my good lord, away.

Dialogue#KENT=Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;
Dialogue#KENT=Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
Dialogue#KENT=A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:
Dialogue#KENT=Give you good morrow!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.

Dialogue#KENT=To the warm sun!
Dialogue#KENT=Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,

Dialogue#KENT=But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,
Dialogue#KENT=Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
Dialogue#KENT=Of my obscured course; and shall find time
Dialogue#KENT=From this enormous state, seeking to give

Dialogue#KING LEAR=No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:

Dialogue#REGAN=Is it not well? What should you need of more?
Dialogue#REGAN=Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger

Dialogue#GONERIL=Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
Dialogue#GONERIL=From those that she calls servants or from mine?

Dialogue#REGAN=Will I give place or notice.

Dialogue#KING LEAR=Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;
Dialogue#KING LEAR=If only to go warm were gorgeous,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,

Dialogue#Old Man=Fellow, where goest?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Is it a beggar-man?
Dialogue#Old Man=Madman and beggar too.

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And bring some covering for this naked soul,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Who I'll entreat to lead me.

Dialogue#EDGAR=thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! five
Dialogue#EDGAR=fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as
Dialogue#EDGAR=Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of
Dialogue#EDGAR=stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of
Dialogue#EDGAR=mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;

Dialogue#EDGAR=Ay, master.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Looks fearfully in the confined deep:

Dialogue#OSWALD=Madam, within; but never man so changed.
Dialogue#OSWALD=I told him of the army that was landed;
Dialogue#OSWALD=He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:
Dialogue#OSWALD=His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,
Dialogue#OSWALD=And of the loyal service of his son,
Dialogue#OSWALD=When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,
Dialogue#OSWALD=And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:
Dialogue#OSWALD=What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
Dialogue#OSWALD=What like, offensive.
Dialogue#GONERIL=[To EDMUND]  Then shall you go no further.
Dialogue#GONERIL=It is the cowish terror of his spirit,

Dialogue#GONERIL=May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;

Dialogue#ALBANY=Cannot be border'd certain in itself;
Dialogue#ALBANY=She that herself will sliver and disbranch
Dialogue#ALBANY=From her material sap, perforce must wither
Dialogue#ALBANY=And come to deadly use.
Dialogue#GONERIL=No more; the text is foolish.
Dialogue#ALBANY=Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:

Dialogue#ALBANY=Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
Dialogue#ALBANY=A father, and a gracious aged man,
Dialogue#ALBANY=Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
Dialogue#ALBANY=Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.

Dialogue#GONERIL='Alack, why does he so?'

Dialogue#ALBANY=So horrid as in woman.
Dialogue#GONERIL=O vain fool!
Dialogue#ALBANY=Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,
Dialogue#ALBANY=Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness

Dialogue#Messenger=A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
Dialogue#Messenger=Opposed against the act, bending his sword
Dialogue#Messenger=To his great master; who, thereat enraged,
Dialogue#Messenger=Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
Dialogue#Messenger=But not without that harmful stroke, which since
Dialogue#Messenger=Hath pluck'd him after.
Dialogue#ALBANY=This shows you are above,

Dialogue#ALBANY=Lost he his other eye?
Dialogue#Messenger=Both, both, my lord.

Dialogue#Gentleman=of; which imports to the kingdom so much
Dialogue#Gentleman=fear and danger, that his personal return was
Dialogue#Gentleman=most required and necessary.
Dialogue#KENT=Who hath he left behind him general?
Dialogue#Gentleman=The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.
Dialogue#KENT=Did your letters pierce the queen to any
Dialogue#KENT=demonstration of grief?
Dialogue#Gentleman=Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
Dialogue#Gentleman=And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
Dialogue#Gentleman=Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
Dialogue#Gentleman=Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
Dialogue#Gentleman=Sought to be king o'er her.
Dialogue#KENT=O, then it moved her.
Dialogue#Gentleman=Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
Dialogue#Gentleman=Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
Dialogue#Gentleman=Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
Dialogue#Gentleman=Were like a better way: those happy smilets,
Dialogue#Gentleman=That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
Dialogue#Gentleman=What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
Dialogue#Gentleman=As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
Dialogue#Gentleman=Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,
Dialogue#Gentleman=If all could so become it.
Dialogue#KENT=Made she no verbal question?
Dialogue#Gentleman='Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'
Dialogue#Gentleman=Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:
Dialogue#Gentleman=Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
Dialogue#Gentleman=Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
Dialogue#Gentleman=Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
Dialogue#Gentleman=The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
Dialogue#Gentleman=And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
Dialogue#Gentleman=To deal with grief alone.
Dialogue#KENT=It is the stars,
Dialogue#KENT=The stars above us, govern our conditions;
Dialogue#KENT=Else one self mate and mate could not beget
Dialogue#KENT=Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
Dialogue#Gentleman=No.
Dialogue#KENT=Was this before the king return'd?
Dialogue#Gentleman=No, since.
Dialogue#KENT=Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;
Dialogue#KENT=Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
Dialogue#KENT=What we are come about, and by no means
Dialogue#KENT=Will yield to see his daughter.
Dialogue#Gentleman=Why, good sir?
Dialogue#KENT=A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
Dialogue#KENT=That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
Dialogue#KENT=To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
Dialogue#KENT=To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting
Dialogue#KENT=His mind so venomously, that burning shame
Dialogue#KENT=Detains him from Cordelia.
Dialogue#Gentleman=Alack, poor gentleman!
Dialogue#KENT=Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
Dialogue#Gentleman='Tis so, they are afoot.

Dialogue#OSWALD=I know not, lady.
Dialogue#REGAN='Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.

Dialogue#REGAN=In pity of his misery, to dispatch
Dialogue#REGAN=His nighted life: moreover, to descry

Dialogue#REGAN=I know your lady does not love her husband;
Dialogue#REGAN=I am sure of that: and at her late being here

Dialogue#REGAN=To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Methinks you're better spoken.
Dialogue#EDGAR=Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful

Dialogue#EDGAR=Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
Dialogue#EDGAR=Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!

Dialogue#EDGAR=Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy
Dialogue#EDGAR=Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,
Dialogue#EDGAR=That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=If I could bear it longer, and not fall
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,

Notice#He falls forward
Dialogue#EDGAR=Gone, sir: farewell.
Dialogue#EDGAR=And yet I know not how conceit may rob

Dialogue#EDGAR=Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far
Dialogue#EDGAR=Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Alack, I have no eyes.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,

Dialogue#KING LEAR=Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered
Dialogue#KING LEAR=me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my
Dialogue#KING LEAR=beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'
Dialogue#KING LEAR=and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'
Dialogue#KING LEAR=too was no good divinity. When the rain came to
Dialogue#KING LEAR=wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when
Dialogue#KING LEAR=the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I
Dialogue#KING LEAR=found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The trick of that voice I do well remember:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Is 't not the king?
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Ay, every inch a king:
Dialogue#KING LEAR=When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
Dialogue#KING LEAR=The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Does lecher in my sight.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Was kinder to his father than my daughters
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Behold yond simpering dame,

Dialogue#Herald=This present summons?
Dialogue#EDGAR=Know, my name is lost;
Dialogue#EDGAR=By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:
Dialogue#EDGAR=Yet am I noble as the adversary
Dialogue#EDGAR=I come to cope.
Dialogue#ALBANY=                  Which is that adversary?

Dialogue#EDGAR=This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent
Dialogue#EDGAR=To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
Dialogue#EDGAR=Thou liest.
Dialogue#EDMUND=In wisdom I should ask thy name;
Dialogue#EDMUND=But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
Dialogue#EDMUND=And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
Dialogue#EDMUND=What safe and nicely I might well delay
Dialogue#EDMUND=By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:
Dialogue#EDMUND=Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;
Dialogue#EDMUND=With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
Dialogue#EDMUND=Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,
Dialogue#EDMUND=This sword of mine shall give them instant way,

Dialogue#EDMUND=That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
Dialogue#EDMUND=I do forgive thee.
Dialogue#EDGAR=                  Let's exchange charity.

Dialogue#EDGAR=My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
Dialogue#EDGAR=The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
Dialogue#EDGAR=Make instruments to plague us:
Dialogue#EDGAR=The dark and vicious place where thee he got
Dialogue#EDGAR=Cost him his eyes.
Dialogue#EDMUND=                  Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;
Dialogue#EDMUND=The wheel is come full circle: I am here.
Dialogue#ALBANY=Methought thy very gait did prophesy
Dialogue#ALBANY=A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
Dialogue#ALBANY=Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
Dialogue#ALBANY=Did hate thee or thy father!
Dialogue#EDGAR=Worthy prince, I know't.
Dialogue#ALBANY=Where have you hid yourself?
Dialogue#ALBANY=How have you known the miseries of your father?
Dialogue#EDGAR=By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
Dialogue#EDGAR=And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
Dialogue#EDGAR=The bloody proclamation to escape,
Dialogue#EDGAR=That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!
Dialogue#EDGAR=That we the pain of death would hourly die
Dialogue#EDGAR=Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
Dialogue#EDGAR=Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
Dialogue#EDGAR=That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
Dialogue#EDGAR=Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
Dialogue#EDGAR=Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,
Dialogue#EDGAR=Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;
Dialogue#EDGAR=Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
Dialogue#EDGAR=Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:
Dialogue#EDGAR=Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
Dialogue#EDGAR=I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
Dialogue#EDGAR=Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,
Dialogue#EDGAR=Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
Dialogue#EDGAR='Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
Dialogue#EDGAR=Burst smilingly.
Dialogue#EDMUND=This speech of yours hath moved me,
Dialogue#EDMUND=And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
Dialogue#EDMUND=You look as you had something more to say.
Dialogue#ALBANY=If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
Dialogue#ALBANY=For I am almost ready to dissolve,
Dialogue#ALBANY=Hearing of this.
Dialogue#EDGAR=                  This would have seem'd a period
Dialogue#EDGAR=To such as love not sorrow; but another,
Dialogue#EDGAR=To amplify too much, would make much more,
Dialogue#EDGAR=And top extremity.
Dialogue#EDGAR=Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
Dialogue#EDGAR=Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
Dialogue#EDGAR=Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
Dialogue#EDGAR=Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms
Dialogue#EDGAR=He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out
Dialogue#EDGAR=As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
Dialogue#EDGAR=Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
Dialogue#EDGAR=That ever ear received: which in recounting
Dialogue#EDGAR=His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
Dialogue#EDGAR=Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
Dialogue#EDGAR=And there I left him tranced.
Dialogue#ALBANY=But who was this?
Dialogue#EDGAR=Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
Dialogue#EDGAR=Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
Dialogue#EDGAR=Improper for a slave.
Notice#Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife
Dialogue#Gentleman=Help, help, O, help!
Dialogue#EDGAR=What kind of help?
Dialogue#ALBANY=Speak, man.
Dialogue#EDGAR=What means that bloody knife?
Dialogue#Gentleman='Tis hot, it smokes;
Dialogue#Gentleman=It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!
Dialogue#ALBANY=Who dead? speak, man.
Dialogue#Gentleman=Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
Dialogue#Gentleman=By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.
Dialogue#EDMUND=I was contracted to them both: all three
Dialogue#EDMUND=Now marry in an instant.
Dialogue#EDGAR=Here comes Kent.
Dialogue#ALBANY=Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:

Dialogue#ALBANY=Touches us not with pity.

Dialogue#KENT=Is he not here?
Dialogue#ALBANY=                  Great thing of us forgot!
Dialogue#ALBANY=Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
Dialogue#ALBANY=See'st thou this object, Kent?
Notice#The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in
Dialogue#KENT=Alack, why thus?
Dialogue#EDMUND=                  Yet Edmund was beloved:
Dialogue#EDMUND=The one the other poison'd for my sake,
Dialogue#EDMUND=And after slew herself.
Dialogue#ALBANY=Even so. Cover their faces.
Dialogue#EDMUND=I pant for life: some good I mean to do,
Dialogue#EDMUND=Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
Dialogue#EDMUND=Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ
Dialogue#EDMUND=Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:
Dialogue#EDMUND=Nay, send in time.
Dialogue#ALBANY=                  Run, run, O, run!
Dialogue#EDGAR=To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send
Dialogue#EDGAR=Thy token of reprieve.
Dialogue#EDMUND=Well thought on: take my sword,
Dialogue#EDMUND=Give it the captain.
Dialogue#ALBANY=Haste thee, for thy life.
Notice#Exit EDGAR
Dialogue#EDMUND=He hath commission from thy wife and me

Dialogue#KING LEAR=That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
Dialogue#KING LEAR=I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
Dialogue#KING LEAR=She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;
Dialogue#KING LEAR=If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Why, then she lives.
Dialogue#KENT=Is this the promised end
Dialogue#EDGAR=Or image of that horror?
Dialogue#ALBANY=Fall, and cease!
Dialogue#KING LEAR=This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
Dialogue#KING LEAR=That ever I have felt.
Dialogue#KENT=[Kneeling]  O my good master!
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Prithee, away.
Dialogue#EDGAR='Tis noble Kent, your friend.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
Dialogue#KING LEAR=I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
Dialogue#KING LEAR=What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.
Dialogue#Captain='Tis true, my lords, he did.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Did I not, fellow?
Dialogue#KING LEAR=I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
Dialogue#KING LEAR=I would have made them skip: I am old now,
Dialogue#KING LEAR=And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.
Dialogue#KENT=If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,
Dialogue#KENT=One of them we behold.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
Dialogue#KENT=The same,
Dialogue#KENT=Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?
Dialogue#KING LEAR=He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
Dialogue#KING LEAR=He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.
Dialogue#KENT=No, my good lord; I am the very man,--
Dialogue#KING LEAR=I'll see that straight.
Dialogue#KENT=That, from your first of difference and decay,
Dialogue#KENT=Have follow'd your sad steps.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=You are welcome hither.
Dialogue#KENT=Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
Dialogue#KENT=Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,
Dialogue#KENT=And desperately are dead.
Dialogue#KING LEAR=Ay, so I think.

Dialogue#KENT=That would upon the rack of this tough world
Dialogue#KENT=Stretch him out longer.
Dialogue#EDGAR=He is gone, indeed.
Dialogue#KENT=The wonder is, he hath endured so long:
