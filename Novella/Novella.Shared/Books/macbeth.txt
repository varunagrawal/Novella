Dialogue#DUNCAN=What bloody man is that? He can report,
Dialogue#DUNCAN=As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
Dialogue#DUNCAN=The newest state.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=                  This is the sergeant
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
Dialogue#MALCOLM='Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
Dialogue#MALCOLM=As thou didst leave it.
Dialogue#Sergeant=Doubtful it stood;
Dialogue#Sergeant=As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
Dialogue#Sergeant=And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
Dialogue#Sergeant=Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
Dialogue#Sergeant=The multiplying villanies of nature
Dialogue#Sergeant=Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
Dialogue#Sergeant=Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
Dialogue#Sergeant=And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Dialogue#Sergeant=Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
Dialogue#Sergeant=For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
Dialogue#Sergeant=Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Dialogue#Sergeant=Which smoked with bloody execution,
Dialogue#Sergeant=Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Dialogue#Sergeant=Till he faced the slave;
Dialogue#Sergeant=Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Dialogue#Sergeant=Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
Dialogue#Sergeant=And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
Dialogue#DUNCAN=O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
Dialogue#Sergeant=As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
Dialogue#Sergeant=Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
Dialogue#Sergeant=So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
Dialogue#Sergeant=Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
Dialogue#Sergeant=No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
Dialogue#Sergeant=Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
Dialogue#Sergeant=But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
Dialogue#Sergeant=With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
Dialogue#Sergeant=Began a fresh assault.
Dialogue#DUNCAN=Dismay'd not this
Dialogue#DUNCAN=Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
Dialogue#Sergeant=Yes;
Dialogue#Sergeant=As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
Dialogue#Sergeant=If I say sooth, I must report they were
Dialogue#Sergeant=As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
Dialogue#Sergeant=Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
Dialogue#Sergeant=Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
Dialogue#Sergeant=Or memorise another Golgotha,
Dialogue#Sergeant=I cannot tell.
Dialogue#Sergeant=But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.

Dialogue#DUNCAN=Whence camest thou, worthy thane?
Dialogue#ROSS=From Fife, great king;
Dialogue#ROSS=Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
Dialogue#ROSS=And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
Dialogue#ROSS=With terrible numbers,
Dialogue#ROSS=Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
Dialogue#ROSS=The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
Dialogue#ROSS=Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
Dialogue#ROSS=Confronted him with self-comparisons,
Dialogue#ROSS=Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
Dialogue#ROSS=Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
Dialogue#ROSS=The victory fell on us.
Dialogue#DUNCAN=Great happiness!
Dialogue#ROSS=That now
Dialogue#ROSS=Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
Dialogue#ROSS=Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Dialogue#ROSS=Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
Dialogue#ROSS=Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
Dialogue#DUNCAN=No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive

Dialogue#First Witch=Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:

Dialogue#First Witch=I' the shipman's card.
Dialogue#First Witch=I will drain him dry as hay:
Dialogue#First Witch=Sleep shall neither night nor day
Dialogue#First Witch=Hang upon his pent-house lid;
Dialogue#First Witch=He shall live a man forbid:
Dialogue#First Witch=Weary se'nnights nine times nine

Dialogue#BANQUO=That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
Dialogue#BANQUO=And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
Dialogue#BANQUO=That man may question? You seem to understand me,
Dialogue#BANQUO=By each at once her chappy finger laying
Dialogue#BANQUO=Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
Dialogue#BANQUO=And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
Dialogue#BANQUO=That you are so.
Dialogue#MACBETH=                  Speak, if you can: what are you?
Dialogue#First Witch=All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!
Dialogue#Second Witch=All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!
Dialogue#Third Witch=All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!
Dialogue#BANQUO=Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
Dialogue#BANQUO=Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
Dialogue#BANQUO=Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
Dialogue#BANQUO=Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
Dialogue#BANQUO=You greet with present grace and great prediction
Dialogue#BANQUO=Of noble having and of royal hope,
Dialogue#BANQUO=That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
Dialogue#BANQUO=If you can look into the seeds of time,
Dialogue#BANQUO=And say which grain will grow and which will not,
Dialogue#BANQUO=Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
Dialogue#BANQUO=Your favours nor your hate.
Dialogue#First Witch=Hail!
Dialogue#Second Witch=Hail!
Dialogue#Third Witch=Hail!

Dialogue#Third Witch=Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
Dialogue#Third Witch=So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
Dialogue#First Witch=Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
Dialogue#MACBETH=Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
Dialogue#MACBETH=By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
Dialogue#MACBETH=But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
Dialogue#MACBETH=A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
Dialogue#MACBETH=Stands not within the prospect of belief,
Dialogue#MACBETH=No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
Dialogue#MACBETH=You owe this strange intelligence? or why
Dialogue#MACBETH=Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
Dialogue#MACBETH=With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
Notice#Witches vanish
Dialogue#BANQUO=The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
Dialogue#BANQUO=And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?
Dialogue#MACBETH=Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
Dialogue#MACBETH=As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
Dialogue#BANQUO=Were such things here as we do speak about?
Dialogue#BANQUO=Or have we eaten on the insane root
Dialogue#BANQUO=That takes the reason prisoner?
Dialogue#MACBETH=Your children shall be kings.

Dialogue#ROSS=The news of thy success; and when he reads
Dialogue#ROSS=Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
Dialogue#ROSS=His wonders and his praises do contend
Dialogue#ROSS=Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
Dialogue#ROSS=In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
Dialogue#ROSS=He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
Dialogue#ROSS=Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
Dialogue#ROSS=Strange images of death. As thick as hail
Dialogue#ROSS=Came post with post; and every one did bear
Dialogue#ROSS=Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
Dialogue#ROSS=And pour'd them down before him.
Dialogue#ANGUS=We are sent
Dialogue#ANGUS=To give thee from our royal master thanks;
Dialogue#ANGUS=Only to herald thee into his sight,
Dialogue#ANGUS=Not pay thee.
Dialogue#ROSS=And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
Dialogue#ROSS=He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:
Dialogue#ROSS=In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
Dialogue#ROSS=For it is thine.
Dialogue#BANQUO=                  What, can the devil speak true?
Dialogue#MACBETH=The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
Dialogue#MACBETH=In borrow'd robes?
Dialogue#ANGUS=                  Who was the thane lives yet;
Dialogue#ANGUS=But under heavy judgment bears that life
Dialogue#ANGUS=Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
Dialogue#ANGUS=With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
Dialogue#ANGUS=With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
Dialogue#ANGUS=He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
Dialogue#ANGUS=But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
Dialogue#ANGUS=Have overthrown him.
Dialogue#MACBETH=[Aside]  Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
Dialogue#MACBETH=The greatest is behind.
Notice#To ROSS and ANGUS
Dialogue#MACBETH=Thanks for your pains.
Notice#To BANQUO
Dialogue#MACBETH=Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
Dialogue#MACBETH=When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
Dialogue#MACBETH=Promised no less to them?
Dialogue#BANQUO=That trusted home
Dialogue#BANQUO=Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Dialogue#BANQUO=Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
Dialogue#BANQUO=And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
Dialogue#BANQUO=The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
Dialogue#BANQUO=Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
Dialogue#BANQUO=In deepest consequence.
Dialogue#BANQUO=Cousins, a word, I pray you.
Dialogue#MACBETH=[Aside]	Two truths are told,
Dialogue#MACBETH=As happy prologues to the swelling act
Dialogue#MACBETH=Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.
Notice#Aside
Dialogue#MACBETH=Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Why hath it given me earnest of success,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
Dialogue#MACBETH=If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
Dialogue#MACBETH=Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
Dialogue#MACBETH=And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Against the use of nature? Present fears
Dialogue#MACBETH=Are less than horrible imaginings:
Dialogue#MACBETH=My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Shakes so my single state of man that function
Dialogue#MACBETH=Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
Dialogue#MACBETH=But what is not.
Dialogue#BANQUO=                  Look, how our partner's rapt.
Dialogue#MACBETH=[Aside]  If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Without my stir.
Dialogue#BANQUO=                  New horrors come upon him,
Dialogue#BANQUO=Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
Dialogue#BANQUO=But with the aid of use.
Dialogue#MACBETH=[Aside]                Come what come may,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
Dialogue#BANQUO=Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
Dialogue#MACBETH=Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
Dialogue#MACBETH=With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
Dialogue#MACBETH=Are register'd where every day I turn
Dialogue#MACBETH=The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
Dialogue#MACBETH=Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
Dialogue#MACBETH=The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
Dialogue#MACBETH=Our free hearts each to other.

Dialogue#MALCOLM=Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
Dialogue#MALCOLM=A deep repentance: nothing in his life
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Became him like the leaving it; he died
Dialogue#MALCOLM=As one that had been studied in his death
Dialogue#MALCOLM=To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=As 'twere a careless trifle.

Notice#Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS
Dialogue#DUNCAN=O worthiest cousin!
Dialogue#DUNCAN=The sin of my ingratitude even now
Dialogue#DUNCAN=Was heavy on me: thou art so far before

Dialogue#DUNCAN=To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
Dialogue#DUNCAN=That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Dialogue#DUNCAN=Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
Dialogue#DUNCAN=More is thy due than more than all can pay.
Dialogue#MACBETH=The service and the loyalty I owe,
Dialogue#MACBETH=In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part
Dialogue#MACBETH=Is to receive our duties; and our duties
Dialogue#MACBETH=Are to your throne and state children and servants,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Which do but what they should, by doing every thing
Dialogue#MACBETH=Safe toward your love and honour.
Dialogue#DUNCAN=Welcome hither:

Dialogue#BANQUO=The harvest is your own.
Dialogue#DUNCAN=My plenteous joys,

Dialogue#DUNCAN=We will establish our estate upon
Dialogue#DUNCAN=Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
Dialogue#DUNCAN=The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must

Dialogue#DUNCAN=On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,

Dialogue#MACBETH=The rest is labour, which is not used for you:
Dialogue#MACBETH=I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
Dialogue#MACBETH=The hearing of my wife with your approach;
Dialogue#MACBETH=So humbly take my leave.
Dialogue#DUNCAN=My worthy Cawdor!
Dialogue#MACBETH=[Aside]  The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
Dialogue#MACBETH=On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
Dialogue#MACBETH=For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;

Dialogue#MACBETH=The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.

Dialogue#MACBETH=Hath he ask'd for me?
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Know you not he has?
Dialogue#MACBETH=We will proceed no further in this business:
Dialogue#MACBETH=He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
Dialogue#MACBETH=Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Not cast aside so soon.
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Was the hope drunk
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?

Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=At what it did so freely? From this time
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=To be the same in thine own act and valour
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=And live a coward in thine own esteem,
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Like the poor cat i' the adage?
Dialogue#MACBETH=Prithee, peace:
Dialogue#MACBETH=I dare do all that may become a man;
Dialogue#MACBETH=Who dares do more is none.
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=What beast was't, then,
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=That made you break this enterprise to me?
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=When you durst do it, then you were a man;
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=And, to be more than what you were, you would
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=I would, while it was smiling in my face,
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Have done to this.

Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Of our great quell?
Dialogue#MACBETH=Bring forth men-children only;

Dialogue#BANQUO=All's well.
Dialogue#BANQUO=I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
Dialogue#BANQUO=To you they have show'd some truth.
Dialogue#MACBETH=I think not of them:
Dialogue#MACBETH=Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
Dialogue#MACBETH=We would spend it in some words upon that business,
Dialogue#MACBETH=If you would grant the time.
Dialogue#BANQUO=At your kind'st leisure.

Dialogue#MACBETH=Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
Dialogue#MACBETH=With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design

Dialogue#MACBETH=Chief nourisher in life's feast,--
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=What do you mean?

Dialogue#MACBETH=Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=You do unbend your noble strength, to think
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=The sleepy grooms with blood.
Dialogue#MACBETH=I'll go no more:
Dialogue#MACBETH=I am afraid to think what I have done;
Dialogue#MACBETH=Look on't again I dare not.
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Infirm of purpose!
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood

Dialogue#Porter=provoker of three things.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=What three things does drink especially provoke?
Dialogue#Porter=Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
Dialogue#Porter=urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;
Dialogue#Porter=it provokes the desire, but it takes
Dialogue#Porter=away the performance: therefore, much drink
Dialogue#Porter=may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
Dialogue#Porter=it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
Dialogue#Porter=him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
Dialogue#Porter=and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and
Dialogue#Porter=not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him
Dialogue#Porter=in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.

Dialogue#BANQUO=It should not stand in thy posterity,
Dialogue#BANQUO=But that myself should be the root and father

Dialogue#MACBETH=Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
Dialogue#MACBETH=My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
Dialogue#MACBETH=When first they put the name of king upon me,
Dialogue#MACBETH=And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
Dialogue#MACBETH=They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
Dialogue#MACBETH=Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
Dialogue#MACBETH=And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
Dialogue#MACBETH=No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
Dialogue#MACBETH=For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;

Dialogue#First Murderer=You made it known to us.
Dialogue#MACBETH=I did so, and went further, which is now
Dialogue#MACBETH=Our point of second meeting. Do you find

Dialogue#MACBETH=And beggar'd yours for ever?
Dialogue#First Murderer=We are men, my liege.

Dialogue#Both Murderers=True, my lord.
Dialogue#MACBETH=So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,

Dialogue#MACBETH=For sundry weighty reasons.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=We shall, my lord,
Dialogue#Second Murderer=Perform what you command us.

Dialogue#MACBETH=To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
Dialogue#MACBETH=Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Whose absence is no less material to me
Dialogue#MACBETH=Than is his father's, must embrace the fate

Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=With them they think on? Things without all remedy
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=Should be without regard: what's done is done.
Dialogue#MACBETH=We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
Dialogue#MACBETH=She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
Dialogue#MACBETH=Remains in danger of her former tooth.
Dialogue#MACBETH=But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
Dialogue#MACBETH=worlds suffer,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
Dialogue#MACBETH=In the affliction of these terrible dreams
Dialogue#MACBETH=That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,

Dialogue#MACBETH=Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=But in them nature's copy's not eterne.

Dialogue#MACBETH=His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
Dialogue#MACBETH=The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
Dialogue#MACBETH=Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
Dialogue#MACBETH=A deed of dreadful note.
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=What's to be done?
Dialogue#MACBETH=Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
Dialogue#MACBETH=And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Dialogue#MACBETH=Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Dialogue#MACBETH=Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
Dialogue#MACBETH=Makes wing to the rooky wood:
Dialogue#MACBETH=Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
Dialogue#MACBETH=While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.

Dialogue#LENNOX=My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
Dialogue#LENNOX=Which can interpret further: only, I say,
Dialogue#LENNOX=Things have been strangely borne. The
Dialogue#LENNOX=gracious Duncan
Dialogue#LENNOX=Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
Dialogue#LENNOX=And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
Dialogue#LENNOX=Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,
Dialogue#LENNOX=For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
Dialogue#LENNOX=Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
Dialogue#LENNOX=It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
Dialogue#LENNOX=To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
Dialogue#LENNOX=How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
Dialogue#LENNOX=In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
Dialogue#LENNOX=That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Dialogue#LENNOX=Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
Dialogue#LENNOX=For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
Dialogue#LENNOX=To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,
Dialogue#LENNOX=He has borne all things well: and I do think
Dialogue#LENNOX=That had he Duncan's sons under his key--
Dialogue#LENNOX=As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they
Dialogue#LENNOX=should find
Dialogue#LENNOX=What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
Dialogue#LENNOX=But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd

Dialogue#Lord=Lives in the English court, and is received

Dialogue#Lord=Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
Dialogue#Lord=Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
Dialogue#Lord=To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:
Dialogue#Lord=That, by the help of these--with Him above
Dialogue#Lord=To ratify the work--we may again
Dialogue#Lord=Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
Dialogue#Lord=Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
Dialogue#Lord=Do faithful homage and receive free honours:
Dialogue#Lord=All which we pine for now: and this report
Dialogue#Lord=Hath so exasperate the king that he
Dialogue#Lord=Prepares for some attempt of war.
Dialogue#LENNOX=Sent he to Macduff?
Dialogue#Lord=He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'
Dialogue#Lord=The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
Dialogue#Lord=And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time
Dialogue#Lord=That clogs me with this answer.'
Dialogue#LENNOX=And that well might
Dialogue#LENNOX=Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
Dialogue#LENNOX=His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
Dialogue#LENNOX=Fly to the court of England and unfold
Dialogue#LENNOX=His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
Dialogue#LENNOX=May soon return to this our suffering country

Dialogue#MALCOLM=What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,

Dialogue#MALCOLM=He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;
Dialogue#MALCOLM=but something

Dialogue#MALCOLM=To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb

Dialogue#MACDUFF=I am not treacherous.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=But Macbeth is.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=A good and virtuous nature may recoil
Dialogue#MALCOLM=In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
Dialogue#MALCOLM=your pardon;
Dialogue#MALCOLM=That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Yet grace must still look so.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=I have lost my hopes.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Without leave-taking? I pray you,

Dialogue#MACDUFF=I would not be the villain that thou think'st
Dialogue#MACDUFF=For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
Dialogue#MACDUFF=And the rich East to boot.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Be not offended:
Dialogue#MALCOLM=I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
Dialogue#MALCOLM=It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Is added to her wounds: I think withal
Dialogue#MALCOLM=There would be hands uplifted in my right;

Dialogue#MALCOLM=Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
Dialogue#MALCOLM=That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
Dialogue#MALCOLM=The cistern of my lust, and my desire
Dialogue#MALCOLM=All continent impediments would o'erbear
Dialogue#MALCOLM=That did oppose my will: better Macbeth

Dialogue#MACDUFF=Boundless intemperance
Dialogue#MACDUFF=In nature is a tyranny; it hath been

Dialogue#MALCOLM=With this there grows
Dialogue#MALCOLM=In my most ill-composed affection such
Dialogue#MALCOLM=A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Desire his jewels and this other's house:

Dialogue#MALCOLM=To make me hunger more; that I should forge
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Destroying them for wealth.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=This avarice
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
Dialogue#MACDUFF=The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Of your mere own: all these are portable,
Dialogue#MACDUFF=With other graces weigh'd.

Dialogue#MALCOLM=Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=I have no relish of them, but abound

Dialogue#MACDUFF=Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
Dialogue#MACDUFF=These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,

Dialogue#MALCOLM=Macduff, this noble passion,

Dialogue#MALCOLM=I put myself to thy direction, and

Dialogue#MALCOLM=Already at a point, was setting forth.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness

Dialogue#MALCOLM='Tis call'd the evil:
Dialogue#MALCOLM=A most miraculous work in this good king;
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Which often, since my here-remain in England,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,

Dialogue#MALCOLM=The means that makes us strangers!
Dialogue#ROSS=Sir, amen.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Stands Scotland where it did?
Dialogue#ROSS=Alas, poor country!
Dialogue#ROSS=Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
Dialogue#ROSS=Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
Dialogue#ROSS=But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
Dialogue#ROSS=Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
Dialogue#ROSS=Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
Dialogue#ROSS=A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
Dialogue#ROSS=Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
Dialogue#ROSS=Expire before the flowers in their caps,
Dialogue#ROSS=Dying or ere they sicken.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=O, relation

Dialogue#MACDUFF=How does my wife?
Dialogue#ROSS=Why, well.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=         And all my children?
Dialogue#ROSS=Well too.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
Dialogue#ROSS=No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?
Dialogue#ROSS=When I came hither to transport the tidings,
Dialogue#ROSS=Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
Dialogue#ROSS=Of many worthy fellows that were out;
Dialogue#ROSS=Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
Dialogue#ROSS=For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:
Dialogue#ROSS=Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
Dialogue#ROSS=Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
Dialogue#ROSS=To doff their dire distresses.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Be't their comfort
Dialogue#MALCOLM=We are coming thither: gracious England hath
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
Dialogue#MALCOLM=An older and a better soldier none
Dialogue#MALCOLM=That Christendom gives out.
Dialogue#ROSS=Would I could answer
Dialogue#ROSS=This comfort with the like! But I have words
Dialogue#ROSS=That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
Dialogue#ROSS=Where hearing should not latch them.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=What concern they?
Dialogue#MACDUFF=The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Due to some single breast?
Dialogue#ROSS=No mind that's honest
Dialogue#ROSS=But in it shares some woe; though the main part
Dialogue#ROSS=Pertains to you alone.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=If it be mine,
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.
Dialogue#ROSS=Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
Dialogue#ROSS=Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
Dialogue#ROSS=That ever yet they heard.

Dialogue#ROSS=Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,
Dialogue#ROSS=Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,
Dialogue#ROSS=To add the death of you.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Merciful heaven!
Dialogue#MALCOLM=What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=My children too?
Dialogue#ROSS=                  Wife, children, servants, all
Dialogue#ROSS=That could be found.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=And I must be from thence!
Dialogue#MACDUFF=My wife kill'd too?
Dialogue#ROSS=I have said.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Be comforted:
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=To cure this deadly grief.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=He has no children. All my pretty ones?
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
Dialogue#MACDUFF=What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
Dialogue#MACDUFF=At one fell swoop?
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Dispute it like a man.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=I shall do so;
Dialogue#MACDUFF=But I must also feel it as a man:
Dialogue#MACDUFF=I cannot but remember such things were,
Dialogue#MACDUFF=That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
Dialogue#MACDUFF=And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
Dialogue#MACDUFF=They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
Dialogue#MACDUFF=And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Cut short all intermission; front to front
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Heaven forgive him too!
Dialogue#MALCOLM=This tune goes manly.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth

Dialogue#Gentlewoman=return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.

Dialogue#Gentlewoman=That, sir, which I will not report after her.

Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'

Dialogue#Gentlewoman=She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of
Dialogue#Gentlewoman=that: heaven knows what she has known.

Dialogue#Doctor=Even so?
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's
Dialogue#LADY MACBETH=done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!

Dialogue#MACBETH=Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
Dialogue#MACBETH=For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
Dialogue#MACBETH=And be these juggling fiends no more believed,
Dialogue#MACBETH=That palter with us in a double sense;
Dialogue#MACBETH=That keep the word of promise to our ear,
Dialogue#MACBETH=And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Then yield thee, coward,
Dialogue#MACDUFF=And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
Dialogue#MACDUFF=We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Painted on a pole, and underwrit,
Dialogue#MACDUFF='Here may you see the tyrant.'
Dialogue#MACBETH=I will not yield,
Dialogue#MACBETH=To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
Dialogue#MACBETH=And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
Dialogue#MACBETH=Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
Dialogue#MACBETH=And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
Dialogue#MACBETH=Yet I will try the last. Before my body
Dialogue#MACBETH=I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
Dialogue#MACBETH=And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'

Notice#Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers
Dialogue#MALCOLM=I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
Dialogue#SIWARD=Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,
Dialogue#SIWARD=So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Macduff is missing, and your noble son.
Dialogue#ROSS=Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
Dialogue#ROSS=He only lived but till he was a man;
Dialogue#ROSS=The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
Dialogue#ROSS=In the unshrinking station where he fought,
Dialogue#ROSS=But like a man he died.
Dialogue#SIWARD=Then he is dead?
Dialogue#ROSS=Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
Dialogue#ROSS=Must not be measured by his worth, for then
Dialogue#ROSS=It hath no end.
Dialogue#SIWARD=                  Had he his hurts before?
Dialogue#ROSS=Ay, on the front.
Dialogue#SIWARD=                  Why then, God's soldier be he!
Dialogue#SIWARD=Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
Dialogue#SIWARD=I would not wish them to a fairer death:
Dialogue#SIWARD=And so, his knell is knoll'd.
Dialogue#MALCOLM=He's worth more sorrow,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=And that I'll spend for him.
Dialogue#SIWARD=He's worth no more
Dialogue#SIWARD=They say he parted well, and paid his score:
Dialogue#SIWARD=And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.
Notice#Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head
Dialogue#MACDUFF=Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands
Dialogue#MACDUFF=The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
Dialogue#MACDUFF=I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,

Dialogue#ALL=Hail, King of Scotland!
Notice#Flourish
Dialogue#MALCOLM=We shall not spend a large expense of time

Dialogue#MALCOLM=And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
Dialogue#MALCOLM=In such an honour named. What's more to do,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Which would be planted newly with the time,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=As calling home our exiled friends abroad
Dialogue#MALCOLM=That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Producing forth the cruel ministers
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Took off her life; this, and what needful else
Dialogue#MALCOLM=That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=We will perform in measure, time and place:
Dialogue#MALCOLM=So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
Dialogue#MALCOLM=Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.
