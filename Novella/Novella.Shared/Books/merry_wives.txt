Dialogue:MISTRESS QUICKLY=Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in

Dialogue:MISTRESS QUICKLY=to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as
Dialogue:MISTRESS QUICKLY=she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there

Dialogue:MISTRESS QUICKLY=send her your page; no remedy.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Why, I will.
Dialogue:MISTRESS QUICKLY=Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and
Dialogue:MISTRESS QUICKLY=go between you both; and in any case have a

Dialogue:FORD=for I must let you understand I think myself in

Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.
Dialogue:FORD=I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=your servant.
Dialogue:FORD=Sir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be brief
Dialogue:FORD=with you,--and you have been a man long known to me,
Dialogue:FORD=though I had never so good means, as desire, to make
Dialogue:FORD=myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a
Dialogue:FORD=thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine
Dialogue:FORD=own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have
Dialogue:FORD=one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,
Dialogue:FORD=turn another into the register of your own; that I
Dialogue:FORD=may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you
Dialogue:FORD=yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Very well, sir; proceed.
Dialogue:FORD=There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's
Dialogue:FORD=name is Ford.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Well, sir.
Dialogue:FORD=I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,
Dialogue:FORD=bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting
Dialogue:FORD=observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;
Dialogue:FORD=fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly
Dialogue:FORD=give me sight of her; not only bought many presents
Dialogue:FORD=to give her, but have given largely to many to know
Dialogue:FORD=what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued
Dialogue:FORD=her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the
Dialogue:FORD=wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have
Dialogue:FORD=merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,
Dialogue:FORD=I am sure, I have received none; unless experience
Dialogue:FORD=be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite
Dialogue:FORD=rate, and that hath taught me to say this:
Dialogue:FORD='Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;
Dialogue:FORD=Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?
Dialogue:FORD=Never.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Have you importuned her to such a purpose?
Dialogue:FORD=Never.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Of what quality was your love, then?
Dialogue:FORD=Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so
Dialogue:FORD=that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
Dialogue:FORD=where I erected it.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?
Dialogue:FORD=When I have told you that, I have told you all.
Dialogue:FORD=Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in
Dialogue:FORD=other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that
Dialogue:FORD=there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir
Dialogue:FORD=John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a
Dialogue:FORD=gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable
Dialogue:FORD=discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your
Dialogue:FORD=place and person, generally allowed for your many
Dialogue:FORD=war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=O, sir!
Dialogue:FORD=Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend
Dialogue:FORD=it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only
Dialogue:FORD=give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as
Dialogue:FORD=to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
Dialogue:FORD=Ford's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to
Dialogue:FORD=consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as
Dialogue:FORD=any.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.
Dialogue:FORD=O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on
Dialogue:FORD=the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my
Dialogue:FORD=soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to
Dialogue:FORD=be looked against. Now, could I could come to her
Dialogue:FORD=with any detection in my hand, my desires had
Dialogue:FORD=instance and argument to commend themselves: I
Dialogue:FORD=could drive her then from the ward of her purity,
Dialogue:FORD=her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand
Dialogue:FORD=other her defences, which now are too too strongly
Dialogue:FORD=embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.
Dialogue:FORD=O good sir!
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=I say you shall.
Dialogue:FORD=Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=own appointment; even as you came in to me, her
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=that time the jealous rascally knave her husband
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=know how I speed.
Dialogue:FORD=I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,
Dialogue:FORD=sir?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=and there's my harvest-home.
Dialogue:FORD=I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him
Dialogue:FORD=if you saw him.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.

Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
Dialogue:FORD=How so, sir? Did she change her determination?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual
Dialogue:FALSTAFF='larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.
Dialogue:FORD=What, while you were there?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=While I was there.
Dialogue:FORD=And did he search for you, and could not find you?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.
Dialogue:FORD=A buck-basket!
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.
Dialogue:FORD=And how long lay you there?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=the jealous knave their master in the door, who
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=asked them once or twice what they had in their
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=of three several deaths; first, an intolerable
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=And in the height of this bath, when I was more than
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=that,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.
Dialogue:FORD=In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you
Dialogue:FORD=have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;
Dialogue:FORD=you'll undertake her no more?
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
Dialogue:FORD='Tis past eight already, sir.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall
Dialogue:FALSTAFF=have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall

Dialogue:FORD=and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself
Dialogue:FORD=what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my
Dialogue:FORD=house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he
Dialogue:FORD=should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,
Dialogue:FORD=nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that
Dialogue:FORD=guides him should aid him, I will search
Dialogue:FORD=impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,

Dialogue:MISTRESS PAGE=virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders
Dialogue:MISTRESS PAGE=and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,
Dialogue:MISTRESS PAGE=that ever the devil could have made you our delight?

Dialogue:SLENDER=I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,
Dialogue:SLENDER=and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been
Dialogue:SLENDER=i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he
Dialogue:SLENDER=should have swinged me. If I did not think it had
Dialogue:SLENDER=been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and 'tis
Dialogue:SLENDER=a postmaster's boy.
Dialogue:PAGE=Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.
Dialogue:SLENDER=What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took

Dialogue:PAGE=you should know my daughter by her garments?
