Dialogue:BENEDICK=To sing a song that old was sung,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=From ashes ancient Gower is come;
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Assuming man's infirmities,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=To glad your ear, and please your eyes.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=It hath been sung at festivals,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=On ember-eves and holy-ales;
Dialogue:BENEDICK=And lords and ladies in their lives
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Have read it for restoratives:
Dialogue:BENEDICK=The purchase is to make men glorious;
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=If you, born in these latter times,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=When wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=And that to hear an old man sing
Dialogue:BENEDICK=May to your wishes pleasure bring
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I life would wish, and that I might
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Waste it for you, like taper-light.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:
Dialogue:BENEDICK=The fairest in all Syria,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I tell you what mine authors say:
Dialogue:BENEDICK=This king unto him took a fere,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Who died and left a female heir,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=So buxom, blithe, and full of face,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=As heaven had lent her all his grace;
Dialogue:BENEDICK=With whom the father liking took,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=And her to incest did provoke:
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Bad child; worse father! to entice his own
Dialogue:BENEDICK=To evil should be done by none:
Dialogue:BENEDICK=But custom what they did begin
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Was with long use account no sin.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=The beauty of this sinful dame
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Made many princes thither frame,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=To seek her as a bed-fellow,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Which to prevent he made a law,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=To keep her still, and men in awe,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=That whoso ask'd her for his wife,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=His riddle told not, lost his life:
Dialogue:BENEDICK=So for her many a wight did die,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=As yon grim looks do testify.

Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=The danger of the task you undertake.
Dialogue:PERICLES=I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul
Dialogue:PERICLES=Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Think death no hazard in this enterprise.
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=For the embracements even of Jove himself;
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=The senate-house of planets all did sit,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=To knit in her their best perfections.
Notice:Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
Dialogue:PERICLES=See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
Dialogue:PERICLES=Of every virtue gives renown to men!
Dialogue:PERICLES=Her face the book of praises, where is read
Dialogue:PERICLES=Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence
Dialogue:PERICLES=Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
Dialogue:PERICLES=Could never be her mild companion.
Dialogue:PERICLES=You gods that made me man, and sway in love,
Dialogue:PERICLES=That have inflamed desire in my breast
Dialogue:PERICLES=To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Or die in the adventure, be my helps,
Dialogue:PERICLES=As I am son and servant to your will,
Dialogue:PERICLES=To compass such a boundless happiness!
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Prince Pericles,--
Dialogue:PERICLES=That would be son to great Antiochus.
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=And which, without desert, because thine eye
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=That without covering, save yon field of stars,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=For going on death's net, whom none resist.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught
Dialogue:PERICLES=My frail mortality to know itself,
Dialogue:PERICLES=And by those fearful objects to prepare
Dialogue:PERICLES=This body, like to them, to what I must;
Dialogue:PERICLES=For death remember'd should be like a mirror,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.
Dialogue:PERICLES=I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do
Dialogue:PERICLES=Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;
Dialogue:PERICLES=So I bequeath a happy peace to you
Dialogue:PERICLES=And all good men, as every prince should do;
Dialogue:PERICLES=My riches to the earth from whence they came;
Dialogue:PERICLES=But my unspotted fire of love to you.
Notice:To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
Dialogue:PERICLES=Thus ready for the way of life or death,
Dialogue:PERICLES=I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.
Dialogue:Daughter=Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!
Dialogue:Daughter=Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!
Dialogue:PERICLES=Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Nor ask advice of any other thought
Dialogue:PERICLES=But faithfulness and courage.
Notice:He reads the riddle
Dialogue:PERICLES=I am no viper, yet I feed
Dialogue:PERICLES=On mother's flesh which did me breed.
Dialogue:PERICLES=I sought a husband, in which labour
Dialogue:PERICLES=I found that kindness in a father:
Dialogue:PERICLES=He's father, son, and husband mild;
Dialogue:PERICLES=I mother, wife, and yet his child.
Dialogue:PERICLES=How they may be, and yet in two,
Dialogue:PERICLES=As you will live, resolve it you.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers
Dialogue:PERICLES=That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,
Dialogue:PERICLES=If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?
Dialogue:PERICLES=Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,
Notice:Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
Dialogue:PERICLES=Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:
Dialogue:PERICLES=But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt
Dialogue:PERICLES=For he's no man on whom perfections wait
Dialogue:PERICLES=That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
Dialogue:PERICLES=You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;
Dialogue:PERICLES=Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:
Dialogue:PERICLES=But being play'd upon before your time,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Good sooth, I care not for you.
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=For that's an article within our law,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Either expound now, or receive your sentence.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Great king,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
Dialogue:PERICLES='Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
Dialogue:PERICLES=He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:
Dialogue:PERICLES=For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;
Dialogue:PERICLES=And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
Dialogue:PERICLES=The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:
Dialogue:PERICLES=To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
Dialogue:PERICLES=Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd
Dialogue:PERICLES=By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's
Dialogue:PERICLES=their will;
Dialogue:PERICLES=And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
Dialogue:PERICLES=It is enough you know; and it is fit,
Dialogue:PERICLES=What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
Dialogue:PERICLES=All love the womb that their first being bred,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=[Aside]  Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=the meaning:
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Though by the tenor of our strict edict,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Your exposition misinterpreting,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=We might proceed to cancel of your days;
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Forty days longer we do respite you;
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=If by which time our secret be undone,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=And until then your entertain shall be
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=As doth befit our honour and your worth.
Notice:Exeunt all but PERICLES
Dialogue:PERICLES=How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
Dialogue:PERICLES=When what is done is like an hypocrite,
Dialogue:PERICLES=The which is good in nothing but in sight!
Dialogue:PERICLES=If it be true that I interpret false,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Then were it certain you were not so bad
Dialogue:PERICLES=As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
Dialogue:PERICLES=Where now you're both a father and a son,
Dialogue:PERICLES=By your untimely claspings with your child,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;
Dialogue:PERICLES=And she an eater of her mother's flesh,
Dialogue:PERICLES=By the defiling of her parent's bed;
Dialogue:PERICLES=And both like serpents are, who though they feed
Dialogue:PERICLES=On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men
Dialogue:PERICLES=Blush not in actions blacker than the night,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Will shun no course to keep them from the light.
Dialogue:PERICLES=One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
Dialogue:PERICLES=Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:
Dialogue:PERICLES=Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:
Dialogue:PERICLES=Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,
Dialogue:PERICLES=By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.
Notice:Exit
Notice:Re-enter ANTIOCHUS
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=He hath found the meaning, for which we mean
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=To have his head.
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=In such a loathed manner;
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=And therefore instantly this prince must die:
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=For by his fall my honour must keep high.
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Who attends us there?
Notice:Enter THALIARD
Dialogue:THALIARD=Doth your highness call?
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Thaliard,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Her private actions to your secrecy;
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=And for your faithfulness we will advance you.
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=It fits thee not to ask the reason why,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Because we bid it. Say, is it done?
Dialogue:THALIARD=My lord,
Dialogue:THALIARD='Tis done.
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=         Enough.
Notice:Enter a Messenger
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
Dialogue:Messenger=My lord, prince Pericles is fled.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=As thou
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Wilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shot
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=From a well-experienced archer hits the mark
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'
Dialogue:THALIARD=My lord,
Dialogue:THALIARD=If I can get him within my pistol's length,
Dialogue:THALIARD=I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Thaliard, adieu!
Notice:Exit THALIARD
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=Till Pericles be dead,
Dialogue:ANTIOCHUS=My heart can lend no succor to my head.

Banner:SCENE II. Tyre. A room in the palace.
Notice:Enter PERICLES
Dialogue:PERICLES=[To Lords without]  Let none disturb us.--Why should
Dialogue:PERICLES=this change of thoughts,
Dialogue:PERICLES=The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Be my so used a guest as not an hour,
Dialogue:PERICLES=In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,
Dialogue:PERICLES=The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?
Dialogue:PERICLES=Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
Dialogue:PERICLES=And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:
Dialogue:PERICLES=Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
Dialogue:PERICLES=That have their first conception by mis-dread,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Have after-nourishment and life by care;
Dialogue:PERICLES=And what was first but fear what might be done,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
Dialogue:PERICLES=And so with me: the great Antiochus,
Dialogue:PERICLES='Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Since he's so great can make his will his act,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;
Dialogue:PERICLES=Nor boots it me to say I honour him.
Dialogue:PERICLES=If he suspect I may dishonour him:
Dialogue:PERICLES=And what may make him blush in being known,
Dialogue:PERICLES=He'll stop the course by which it might be known;
Dialogue:PERICLES=With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,
Dialogue:PERICLES=And with the ostent of war will look so huge,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Amazement shall drive courage from the state;
Dialogue:PERICLES=Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,
Dialogue:PERICLES=And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:
Dialogue:PERICLES=Which care of them, not pity of myself,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Who am no more but as the tops of trees,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,
Dialogue:PERICLES=And punish that before that he would punish.
Notice:Enter HELICANUS, with other Lords
Dialogue:First Lord=Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!
Dialogue:Second Lord=And keep your mind, till you return to us,
Dialogue:Second Lord=Peaceful and comfortable!
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.
Dialogue:HELICANUS=They do abuse the king that flatter him:
Dialogue:HELICANUS=For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;
Dialogue:HELICANUS=The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.
Dialogue:HELICANUS=When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;
Dialogue:HELICANUS=I cannot be much lower than my knees.
Dialogue:PERICLES=All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlook
Dialogue:PERICLES=What shipping and what lading's in our haven,
Dialogue:PERICLES=And then return to us.
Notice:Exeunt Lords
Dialogue:PERICLES=Helicanus, thou
Dialogue:PERICLES=Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?
Dialogue:HELICANUS=An angry brow, dread lord.
Dialogue:PERICLES=If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
Dialogue:PERICLES=How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?
Dialogue:HELICANUS=How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence
Dialogue:HELICANUS=They have their nourishment?
Dialogue:PERICLES=Thou know'st I have power
Dialogue:PERICLES=To take thy life from thee.
Dialogue:HELICANUS=[Kneeling]
Dialogue:HELICANUS=I have ground the axe myself;
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Do you but strike the blow.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Rise, prithee, rise.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Sit down: thou art no flatterer:
Dialogue:PERICLES=I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid
Dialogue:PERICLES=That kings should let their ears hear their
Dialogue:PERICLES=faults hid!
Dialogue:PERICLES=Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,
Dialogue:PERICLES=What wouldst thou have me do?
Dialogue:HELICANUS=To bear with patience
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,
Dialogue:PERICLES=That minister'st a potion unto me
Dialogue:PERICLES=That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,
Dialogue:PERICLES=I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.
Dialogue:PERICLES=From whence an issue I might propagate,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
Dialogue:PERICLES=The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:
Dialogue:PERICLES=Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
Dialogue:PERICLES=Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou
Dialogue:PERICLES=know'st this,
Dialogue:PERICLES='Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Under the covering of a careful night,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
Dialogue:PERICLES=I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears
Dialogue:PERICLES=Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:
Dialogue:PERICLES=And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
Dialogue:PERICLES=That I should open to the listening air
Dialogue:PERICLES=How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,
Dialogue:PERICLES=To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
Dialogue:PERICLES=To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,
Dialogue:PERICLES=And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:
Dialogue:PERICLES=When all, for mine, if I may call offence,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:
Dialogue:PERICLES=Which love to all, of which thyself art one,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Who now reprovest me for it,--
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Alas, sir!
Dialogue:PERICLES=Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
Dialogue:PERICLES=How I might stop this tempest ere it came;
Dialogue:PERICLES=And finding little comfort to relieve them,
Dialogue:PERICLES=I thought it princely charity to grieve them.
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Who either by public war or private treason
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Will take away your life.
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Your rule direct to any; if to me.
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.
Dialogue:PERICLES=I do not doubt thy faith;
Dialogue:PERICLES=But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?
Dialogue:HELICANUS=We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=From whence we had our being and our birth.
Dialogue:PERICLES=Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus
Dialogue:PERICLES=Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee;
Dialogue:PERICLES=And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.
Dialogue:PERICLES=The care I had and have of subjects' good
Dialogue:PERICLES=On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.
Dialogue:PERICLES=I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:
Dialogue:PERICLES=Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:
Dialogue:PERICLES=But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,
Dialogue:PERICLES=That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,
Dialogue:PERICLES=Thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince.

Notice:Enter THALIARD
Dialogue:THALIARD=So, this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I
Dialogue:THALIARD=kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to
Dialogue:THALIARD=be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceive
Dialogue:THALIARD=he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,
Dialogue:THALIARD=being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired
Dialogue:THALIARD=he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he
Dialogue:THALIARD=had some reason for't; for if a king bid a man be a
Dialogue:THALIARD=villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to
Dialogue:THALIARD=be one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.
Notice:Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES, with other Lords of Tyre
Dialogue:HELICANUS=You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Further to question me of your king's departure:
Dialogue:HELICANUS=His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.
Dialogue:THALIARD=[Aside]  How! the king gone!
Dialogue:HELICANUS=If further yet you will be satisfied,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Being at Antioch--
Dialogue:THALIARD=[Aside]          What from Antioch?
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Royal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:
Dialogue:HELICANUS=And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;
Dialogue:HELICANUS=So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=With whom each minute threatens life or death.
Dialogue:THALIARD=[Aside]  Well, I perceive
Dialogue:THALIARD=I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;
Dialogue:THALIARD=But since he's gone, the king's seas must please:
Dialogue:THALIARD=He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.
Dialogue:THALIARD=I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.
Dialogue:THALIARD=From him I come
Dialogue:THALIARD=With message unto princely Pericles;
Dialogue:THALIARD=But since my landing I have understood
Dialogue:THALIARD=Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,
Dialogue:THALIARD=My message must return from whence it came.
Dialogue:HELICANUS=We have no reason to desire it,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Commended to our master, not to us:
Dialogue:HELICANUS=Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,
Dialogue:HELICANUS=As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.

Notice:Enter CLEON, the governor of Tarsus, with DIONYZA, and others
Dialogue:CLEON=My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,
Dialogue:CLEON=And by relating tales of others' griefs,
Dialogue:CLEON=See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?
Dialogue:DIONYZA=That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
Dialogue:DIONYZA=For who digs hills because they do aspire
Dialogue:DIONYZA=Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
Dialogue:DIONYZA=O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;
Dialogue:DIONYZA=Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
Dialogue:DIONYZA=But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.
Dialogue:CLEON=O Dionyza,
Dialogue:CLEON=Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,
Dialogue:CLEON=Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
Dialogue:CLEON=Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
Dialogue:CLEON=Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,
Dialogue:CLEON=Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;
Dialogue:CLEON=That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
Dialogue:CLEON=They may awake their helps to comfort them.
Dialogue:CLEON=I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
Dialogue:CLEON=And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.
Dialogue:DIONYZA=I'll do my best, sir.
Dialogue:CLEON=This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,
Dialogue:CLEON=A city on whom plenty held full hand,
Dialogue:CLEON=For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;
Dialogue:CLEON=Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,
Dialogue:CLEON=And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;
Dialogue:CLEON=Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,
Dialogue:CLEON=Like one another's glass to trim them by:
Dialogue:CLEON=Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,
Dialogue:CLEON=And not so much to feed on as delight;
Dialogue:CLEON=All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,
Dialogue:CLEON=The name of help grew odious to repeat.
Dialogue:DIONYZA=O, 'tis too true.
Dialogue:CLEON=But see what heaven can do! By this our change,
Dialogue:CLEON=These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,
Dialogue:CLEON=Were all too little to content and please,
Dialogue:CLEON=Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
Dialogue:CLEON=As houses are defiled for want of use,
Dialogue:CLEON=They are now starved for want of exercise:
Dialogue:CLEON=Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
Dialogue:CLEON=Must have inventions to delight the taste,
Dialogue:CLEON=Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:
Dialogue:CLEON=Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
Dialogue:CLEON=Thought nought too curious, are ready now
Dialogue:CLEON=To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
Dialogue:CLEON=So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
Dialogue:CLEON=Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:
Dialogue:CLEON=Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;
Dialogue:CLEON=Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
Dialogue:CLEON=Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
Dialogue:CLEON=Is not this true?
Dialogue:DIONYZA=Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.
Dialogue:CLEON=O, let those cities that of plenty's cup

Dialogue:First Fisherman=Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what
Dialogue:First Fisherman=pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when,

Dialogue:Third Fisherman=they're half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,

Dialogue:Third Fisherman=marvel how the fishes live in the sea.
Dialogue:First Fisherman=Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the

Dialogue:Third Fisherman=jangling of the bells, that he should never have
Dialogue:Third Fisherman=left, till he cast bells, steeple, church, and

Dialogue:Pandar=too wenchless.
Dialogue:Bawd=We were never so much out of creatures. We have but

Dialogue:Bawd=do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.
Dialogue:Pandar=Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for

Dialogue:Bawd=Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor

Dialogue:Bawd=will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.
Dialogue:Pandar=Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o'

Dialogue:Pandar=O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor

Dialogue:Bawd=Boult, has she any qualities?

Dialogue:BOULT=qualities can make her be refused.
Dialogue:Bawd=What's her price, Boult?
Dialogue:BOULT=I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.
Dialogue:Pandar=Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your

Dialogue:Bawd=inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?
Dialogue:BOULT='Faith, they listened to me as they would have

Dialogue:BOULT=Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the

Dialogue:BOULT=he would see her to-morrow.
Dialogue:Bawd=Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease

Dialogue:Bawd=seem to do that fearfully which you commit
Dialogue:Bawd=willingly, despise profit where you have most gain.
Dialogue:Bawd=To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your
Dialogue:Bawd=lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good
Dialogue:Bawd=opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.
Dialogue:MARINA=I understand you not.
Dialogue:BOULT=O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these
Dialogue:BOULT=blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.
Dialogue:Bawd=Thou sayest true, i' faith, so they must; for your
Dialogue:Bawd=bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go
Dialogue:Bawd=with warrant.
Dialogue:BOULT='Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if
Dialogue:BOULT=I have bargained for the joint,--

Dialogue:Bawd=manner of your garments well.
Dialogue:BOULT=Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.
Dialogue:Bawd=Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a

Dialogue:Bawd=When nature flamed this piece, she meant thee a good
