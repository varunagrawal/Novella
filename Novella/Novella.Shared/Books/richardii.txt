Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=I have, my liege.

Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Or worthily, as a good subject should,
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=On some known ground of treachery in him?
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=As near as I could sift him on that argument,
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=On some apparent danger seen in him
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.

Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Add an immortal title to your crown!
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=As well appeareth by the cause you come;
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=First, heaven be the record to my speech!
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=In the devotion of a subject's love,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=And free from other misbegotten hate,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Come I appellant to this princely presence.
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=My body shall make good upon this earth,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Too good to be so and too bad to live,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY='Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Which else would post until it had return'd
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=I do defy him, and I spit at him;
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Or any other ground inhabitable,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=By that and all the rites of knighthood else,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=I take it up; and by that sword I swear
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=I'll answer thee in any fair degree,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=And when I mount, alive may I not light,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=If I be traitor or unjustly fight!
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=It must be great that can inherit us
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=So much as of a thought of ill in him.
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Besides I say and will in battle prove,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=That ever was survey'd by English eye,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=That all the treasons for these eighteen years
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Complotted and contrived in this land
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Further I say and further will maintain
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Upon his bad life to make all this good,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=And consequently, like a traitor coward,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=To me for justice and rough chastisement;
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=How high a pitch his resolution soars!
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=O, let my sovereign turn away his face
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Till I have told this slander of his blood,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=As he is but my father's brother's son,
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=The other part reserved I by consent,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Upon remainder of a dear account,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=The honourable father to my foe
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=But ere I last received the sacrament
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=It issues from the rancour of a villain,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=A recreant and most degenerate traitor
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Which in myself I boldly will defend;
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=And interchangeably hurl down my gage
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=To prove myself a loyal gentleman
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Your highness to assign our trial day.
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=This we prescribe, though no physician;
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Deep malice makes too deep incision;
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=To be a make-peace shall become my age:
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=And, Norfolk, throw down his.
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=When, Harry, when?
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=Obedience bids I should not bid again.
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Which breathed this poison.
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Rage must be withstood:
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=The purest treasure mortal times afford
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Is spotless reputation: that away,
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Take honour from me, and my life is done:
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
Dialogue:THOMAS MOWBRAY=In that I live and for that will I die.
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=The slavish motive of recanting fear,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.
Notice:Exit JOHN OF GAUNT
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=We were not born to sue, but to command;
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=The swelling difference of your settled hate:
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Since we can not atone you, we shall see

Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
Dialogue:DUCHESS=But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,

Dialogue:DUCHESS=Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,

Dialogue:DUCHESS=In some large measure to thy father's death,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Who was the model of thy father's life.
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
Dialogue:DUCHESS=In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
Dialogue:DUCHESS=That which in mean men we intitle patience
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
Dialogue:DUCHESS=What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=His deputy anointed in His sight,
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=An angry arm against His minister.

Dialogue:DUCHESS=O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=They may break his foaming courser's back,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
Dialogue:DUCHESS=With her companion grief must end her life.
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:
Dialogue:JOHN OF GAUNT=As much good stay with thee as go with me!
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
Dialogue:DUCHESS=I take my leave before I have begun,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
Dialogue:DUCHESS=I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
Dialogue:DUCHESS=With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Alack, and what shall good old York there see
Dialogue:DUCHESS=But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
Dialogue:DUCHESS=And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Therefore commend me; let him not come there,

Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II='Tis very true, my grief lies all within;
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=And these external manners of laments
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=That swells with silence in the tortured soul;

Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=For thy great bounty, that not only givest
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=And then be gone and trouble you no more.
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II=Shall I obtain it?
Dialogue:HENRY BOLINGBROKE=                  Name it, fair cousin.
Dialogue:KING RICHARD II='Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:
