Notice#Enter GLOUCESTER, solus
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Now is the winter of our discontent
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And that so lamely and unfashionable
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Have no delight to pass away the time,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And descant on mine own deformity:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I am determined to prove a villain
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To set my brother Clarence and the king
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=In deadly hate the one against the other:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And if King Edward be as true and just
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Clarence comes.
Notice#Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That waits upon your grace?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=His majesty
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
Dialogue#CLARENCE=This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Upon what cause?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=                  Because my name is George.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=O, belike his majesty hath some intent
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
Dialogue#CLARENCE=As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
Dialogue#CLARENCE=And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=And says a wizard told him that by G
Dialogue#CLARENCE=His issue disinherited should be;
Dialogue#CLARENCE=And, for my name of George begins with G,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=It follows in his thought that I am he.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Have moved his highness to commit me now.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER='Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That tempers him to this extremity.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Was it not she and that good man of worship,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
Dialogue#CLARENCE=But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
Dialogue#CLARENCE=That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Humbly complaining to her deity
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=If we will keep in favour with the king,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To be her men and wear her livery:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=His majesty hath straitly given in charge
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=That no man shall have private conference,
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=Of what degree soever, with his brother.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=You may partake of any thing we say:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=We speak no treason, man: we say the king
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Were best he do it secretly, alone.
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=What one, my lord?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And whatsoever you will employ me in,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I will perform it to enfranchise you.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Meantime, have patience.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=I must perforce. Farewell.
Notice#Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=If heaven will take the present at our hands.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?
Notice#Enter HASTINGS
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Well are you welcome to the open air.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
Dialogue#HASTINGS=With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
Dialogue#HASTINGS=But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
Dialogue#HASTINGS=That were the cause of my imprisonment.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=For they that were your enemies are his,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
Dialogue#HASTINGS=More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=What news abroad?
Dialogue#HASTINGS=No news so bad abroad as this at home;
Dialogue#HASTINGS=The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=And his physicians fear him mightily.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And overmuch consumed his royal person:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER='Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=What, is he in his bed?
Dialogue#HASTINGS=He is.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Go you before, and I will follow you.
Notice#Exit HASTINGS
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Clarence hath not another day to live:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And leave the world for me to bustle in!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The readiest way to make the wench amends
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Is to become her husband and her father:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The which will I; not all so much for love
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=As for another secret close intent,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=By marrying her which I must reach unto.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But yet I run before my horse to market:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=When they are gone, then must I count my gains.

Notice#Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen with halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Set down, set down your honourable load,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=If ever he have child, abortive be it,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=And that be heir to his unhappiness!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=If ever he have wife, let her he made
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=A miserable by the death of him
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=And still, as you are weary of the weight,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
Notice#Enter GLOUCESTER
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=What black magician conjures up this fiend,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=To stop devoted charitable deeds?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
Dialogue#Gentleman=My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Either heaven with lightning strike the
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=murderer dead,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Lady, you know no rules of charity,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=By circumstance, but to acquit myself.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=For these known evils, but to give me leave,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=No excuse current, but to hang thyself.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=By such despair, I should accuse myself.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Say that I slew them not?
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Why, then they are not dead:
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I did not kill your husband.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Why, then he is alive.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Didst thou not kill this king?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I grant ye.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=For he was fitter for that place than earth.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=And thou unfit for any place but hell.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Some dungeon.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=                             Your bed-chamber.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=So will it, madam till I lie with you.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=I hope so.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And fall somewhat into a slower method,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=As blameful as the executioner?
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To undertake the death of all the world,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=As all the world is cheered by the sun,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=So I by that; it is my day, my life.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=I would I were, to be revenged on thee.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=It is a quarrel most unnatural,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To be revenged on him that loveth you.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=To be revenged on him that slew my husband.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Did it to help thee to a better husband.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=He lives that loves thee better than he could.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Name him.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=        Plantagenet.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Why, that was he.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Where is he?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=                 Here.
Notice#She spitteth at him
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Why dost thou spit at me?
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Never came poison from so sweet a place.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I would they were, that I might die at once;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=For now they kill me with a living death.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=No, when my father York and Edward wept,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Told the sad story of my father's death,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I never sued to friend nor enemy;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
Notice#She looks scornfully at him
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
Notice#He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
Notice#Here she lets fall the sword
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Take up the sword again, or take up me.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=I will not be the executioner.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=I have already.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=                  Tush, that was in thy rage:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Speak it again, and, even with the word,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=I would I knew thy heart.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER='Tis figured in my tongue.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=I fear me both are false.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Then never man was true.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Well, well, put up your sword.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Say, then, my peace is made.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=That shall you know hereafter.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But shall I live in hope?
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=All men, I hope, live so.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=To take is not to give.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=What is it?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That it would please thee leave these sad designs
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And presently repair to Crosby Place;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I will with all expedient duty see you:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Grant me this boon.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=To see you are become so penitent.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Bid me farewell.
Dialogue#LADY ANNE='Tis more than you deserve;
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=But since you teach me how to flatter you,
Dialogue#LADY ANNE=Imagine I have said farewell already.
Notice#Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Was ever woman in this humour won?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Having God, her conscience, and these bars
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=against me,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And I nothing to back my suit at all,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Ha!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Framed in the prodigality of nature,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The spacious world cannot again afford
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And made her widow to a woful bed?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I do mistake my person all this while:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And entertain some score or two of tailors,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To study fashions to adorn my body:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Since I am crept in favour with myself,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Will maintain it with some little cost.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And then return lamenting to my love.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That I may see my shadow as I pass.

Dialogue#GREY=To be your comforter when he is gone.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Oh, he is young and his minority
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
Dialogue#RIVERS=Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=It is determined, not concluded yet:
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=But so it must be, if the king miscarry.
Notice#Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY
Dialogue#GREY=Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Good time of day unto your royal grace!
Dialogue#DERBY=God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
Dialogue#DERBY=I do beseech you, either not believe
Dialogue#DERBY=The envious slanders of her false accusers;
Dialogue#DERBY=Or, if she be accused in true report,
Dialogue#DERBY=Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
Dialogue#DERBY=From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.
Dialogue#RIVERS=Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?
Dialogue#DERBY=But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Dialogue#DERBY=Are come from visiting his majesty.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Would all were well! but that will never be
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=I fear our happiness is at the highest.
Notice#Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Who are they that complain unto the king,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I must be held a rancorous enemy.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But thus his simple truth must be abused
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
Dialogue#RIVERS=To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=The king, of his own royal disposition,
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=And not provoked by any suitor else;
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Which in your outward actions shows itself
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Since every Jack became a gentleman
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Gloucester;
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=You envy my advancement and my friends':
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=God grant we never may have need of you!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Myself disgraced, and the nobility
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Are daily given to ennoble those
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=By Him that raised me to this careful height
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=I never did incense his majesty
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=An earnest advocate to plead for him.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=My lord, you do me shameful injury,
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=You may deny that you were not the cause
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
Dialogue#RIVERS=She may, my lord, for--
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=She may do more, sir, than denying that:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=She may help you to many fair preferments,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And then deny her aiding hand therein,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And lay those honours on your high deserts.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--
Dialogue#RIVERS=What, marry, may she?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I wis your grandam had a worser match.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=With those gross taunts I often have endured.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=I had rather be a country servant-maid
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Than a great queen, with this condition,
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
Notice#Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Small joy have I in being England's queen.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=What! threat you me with telling of the king?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I will avouch in presence of the king:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER='Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Out, devil! I remember them too well:
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=A liberal rewarder of his friends:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=In all which time you and your husband Grey
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=What you have been ere now, and what you are;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Which God revenge!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I am too childish-foolish for this world.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
Dialogue#RIVERS=My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
Dialogue#RIVERS=Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
Dialogue#RIVERS=We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
Dialogue#RIVERS=So should we you, if you should be our king.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=As little joy may you suppose in me.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=For I am she, and altogether joyless.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=I can no longer hold me patient.
Notice#Advancing
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=O gentle villain, do not turn away!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=That will I make before I let thee go.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Than death can yield me here by my abode.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=A husband and a son thou owest to me;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The curse my noble father laid on thee,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=His curses, then from bitterness of soul
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=So just is God, to right the innocent.
Dialogue#HASTINGS=O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
Dialogue#RIVERS=Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
Dialogue#DORSET=No man but prophesied revenge for it.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=What were you snarling all before I came,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Ready to catch each other by the throat,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And turn you all your hatred now on me?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=As ours by murder, to make him a king!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And see another, as I see thee now,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Long die thy happy days before thy death;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=That none of you may live your natural age,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And then hurl down their indignation
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=The slave of nature and the son of hell!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thou rag of honour! thou detested--
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Margaret.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=        Richard!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=                  Ha!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=                  I call thee not.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=O, let me make the period to my curse!
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER='Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.
Dialogue#HASTINGS=False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
Dialogue#RIVERS=Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
Dialogue#DORSET=Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=O, that your young nobility could judge
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.
Dialogue#DORSET=It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=As it was won with blood, lost be it so!
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=My charity is outrage, life my shame
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Have done, have done.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=In sign of league and amity with thee:
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Nor no one here; for curses never pass
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Have not to do with him, beware of him;
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And all their ministers attend on him.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=O, but remember this another day,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
Dialogue#QUEEN MARGARET=And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!

Notice#Exit
Dialogue#HASTINGS=My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
Dialogue#RIVERS=And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=My part thereof that I have done to her.
Dialogue#QUEEN ELIZABETH=I never did her any, to my knowledge.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I was too hot to do somebody good,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That is too cold in thinking of it now.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=God pardon them that are the cause of it!
Dialogue#RIVERS=A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
Dialogue#RIVERS=To pray for them that have done scathe to us.

Notice#Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I do beweep to many simple gulls
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And say it is the queen and her allies
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That stir the king against the duke my brother.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And thus I clothe my naked villany
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
Notice#Enter two Murderers
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But, soft! here come my executioners.

Dialogue#First Murderer=That we may be admitted where he is.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
Notice#Gives the warrant
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Tush!
Dialogue#First Murderer=Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
Dialogue#First Murderer=Talkers are no good doers: be assured
Dialogue#First Murderer=We come to use our hands and not our tongues.

Notice#Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=Why looks your grace so heavily today?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=I would not spend another such a night,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=So full of dismal terror was the time!
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
Dialogue#CLARENCE=And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=And cited up a thousand fearful times,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=During the wars of York and Lancaster
Dialogue#CLARENCE=That had befall'n us. As we paced along
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Into the tumbling billows of the main.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
Dialogue#CLARENCE=What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
Dialogue#CLARENCE=What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=Had you such leisure in the time of death
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Methought I had; and often did I strive
Dialogue#CLARENCE=To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
Dialogue#CLARENCE=To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
Dialogue#CLARENCE=But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=Awaked you not with this sore agony?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
Dialogue#CLARENCE=O, then began the tempest to my soul,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
Dialogue#CLARENCE=And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
Dialogue#CLARENCE=A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
Dialogue#CLARENCE='Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
Dialogue#CLARENCE=With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
Dialogue#CLARENCE=I trembling waked, and for a season after
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Could not believe but that I was in hell,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Such terrible impression made the dream.
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Which now bear evidence against my soul,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
Dialogue#CLARENCE=O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
Dialogue#CLARENCE=I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
Dialogue#CLARENCE=My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
Notice#CLARENCE sleeps
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=Princes have but their tides for their glories,
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=An outward honour for an inward toil;
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=And, for unfelt imagination,
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=They often feel a world of restless cares:
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
Notice#Enter the two Murderers
Dialogue#First Murderer=Ho! who's here?
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?
Dialogue#First Murderer=I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=Yea, are you so brief?
Dialogue#Second Murderer=O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
Dialogue#Second Murderer=him our commission; talk no more.
Notice#BRAKENBURY reads it
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=I am, in this, commanded to deliver
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=I will not reason what is meant hereby,
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
Dialogue#BRAKENBURY=Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:

Dialogue#First Murderer=Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.

Dialogue#Second Murderer=What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?
Dialogue#First Murderer=No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
Dialogue#Second Murderer=the judgment-day.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
Dialogue#Second Murderer=of remorse in me.
Dialogue#First Murderer=What, art thou afraid?
Dialogue#Second Murderer=Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
Dialogue#Second Murderer=damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.
Dialogue#First Murderer=I thought thou hadst been resolute.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=So I am, to let him live.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
Dialogue#Second Murderer=will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
Dialogue#Second Murderer=would tell twenty.
Dialogue#First Murderer=How dost thou feel thyself now?
Dialogue#Second Murderer='Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
Dialogue#Second Murderer=within me.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
Dialogue#Second Murderer='Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Where is thy conscience now?
Dialogue#Second Murderer=In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
Dialogue#First Murderer=So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
Dialogue#First Murderer=thy conscience flies out.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.
Dialogue#First Murderer=How if it come to thee again?
Dialogue#Second Murderer=I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
Dialogue#Second Murderer=makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
Dialogue#Second Murderer=accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
Dialogue#Second Murderer=he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
Dialogue#Second Murderer=detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
Dialogue#Second Murderer=mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
Dialogue#Second Murderer=obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
Dialogue#Second Murderer=that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
Dialogue#Second Murderer=is turned out of all towns and cities for a
Dialogue#Second Murderer=dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
Dialogue#Second Murderer=well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
Dialogue#Second Murderer=without it.
Dialogue#First Murderer='Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
Dialogue#First Murderer=not to kill the duke.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
Dialogue#Second Murderer=would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
Dialogue#First Murderer=I warrant thee.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
Dialogue#Second Murderer=reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
Dialogue#First Murderer=Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
Dialogue#First Murderer=sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
Dialogue#First Murderer=in the next room.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?
Dialogue#Second Murderer=No, first let's reason with him.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.
Dialogue#Second murderer=You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=In God's name, what art thou?
Dialogue#Second Murderer=A man, as you are.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=But not, as I am, royal.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=Nor you, as we are, loyal.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
Dialogue#Both=To, to, to--
Dialogue#CLARENCE=To murder me?
Dialogue#Both=Ay, ay.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
Dialogue#First Murderer=Offended us you have not, but the king.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=I shall be reconciled to him again.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
Dialogue#CLARENCE=To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
Dialogue#CLARENCE=The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Before I be convict by course of law,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
Dialogue#CLARENCE=By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=That you depart and lay no hands on me
Dialogue#CLARENCE=The deed you undertake is damnable.
Dialogue#First Murderer=What we will do, we do upon command.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=And he that hath commanded is the king.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Hath in the tables of his law commanded
Dialogue#CLARENCE=That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
Dialogue#Second Murderer=For false forswearing and for murder too:
Dialogue#Second Murderer=Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
Dialogue#Second Murderer=To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
Dialogue#First Murderer=And, like a traitor to the name of God,
Dialogue#First Murderer=Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
Dialogue#First Murderer=Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
Dialogue#First Murderer=How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
Dialogue#First Murderer=When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=He sends ye not to murder me for this
Dialogue#CLARENCE=For in this sin he is as deep as I.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=If God will be revenged for this deed.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
Dialogue#CLARENCE=He needs no indirect nor lawless course
Dialogue#CLARENCE=To cut off those that have offended him.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
Dialogue#First Murderer=When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
Dialogue#First Murderer=That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
Dialogue#First Murderer=Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
Dialogue#CLARENCE=I am his brother, and I love him well.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=If you be hired for meed, go back again,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Who shall reward you better for my life
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Go you to him from me.
Dialogue#Both=Ay, so we will.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Tell him, when that our princely father York
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=And charged us from his soul to love each other,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=He little thought of this divided friendship:
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Right,
Dialogue#First Murderer=As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
Dialogue#First Murderer='Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=That he would labour my delivery.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
Dialogue#Second Murderer=From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=To counsel me to make my peace with God,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
Dialogue#CLARENCE=To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
Dialogue#Second Murderer=What shall we do?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=                  Relent, and save your souls.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Would not entreat for life?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
Dialogue#CLARENCE=O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
Dialogue#CLARENCE=As you would beg, were you in my distress
Dialogue#CLARENCE=A begging prince what beggar pities not?
Dialogue#Second Murderer=Look behind you, my lord.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
Notice#Stabs him
Dialogue#First Murderer=I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
Notice#Exit, with the body

Dialogue#Second Murderer=Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
Notice#Re-enter First Murderer
Dialogue#First Murderer=How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
Dialogue#First Murderer=By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!
Dialogue#Second Murderer=I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
Dialogue#Second Murderer=Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
Dialogue#Second Murderer=For I repent me that the duke is slain.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#First Murderer=So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
Dialogue#First Murderer=Now must I hide his body in some hole,
Dialogue#First Murderer=Until the duke take order for his burial:
Dialogue#First Murderer=And when I have my meed, I must away;
Dialogue#First Murderer=For this will out, and here I must not stay.

Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.
Dialogue#RIVERS=Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Which would be so much the more dangerous
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And may direct his course as please himself,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I hope the king made peace with all of us
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And the compact is firm and true in me.
Dialogue#RIVERS=And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
Dialogue#RIVERS=Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
Dialogue#RIVERS=To no apparent likelihood of breach,
Dialogue#RIVERS=Which haply by much company might be urged:
Dialogue#RIVERS=Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
Dialogue#RIVERS=That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.

Dialogue#Third Citizen=Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
Dialogue#Third Citizen=O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
Dialogue#Third Citizen=And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
Dialogue#Third Citizen=And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
Dialogue#Third Citizen=This sickly land might solace as before.
Dialogue#First Citizen=Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.
Dialogue#Third Citizen=When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;

Dialogue#YORK=Gloucester,
Dialogue#YORK='Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
Dialogue#YORK=And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
Dialogue#YORK=Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.

Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=I want more uncles here to welcome me.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=God keep me from false friends! but they were none.

Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Unto his princely brother presently?
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
Dialogue#CARDINAL=My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory

Dialogue#CARDINAL=To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
Dialogue#CARDINAL=We should infringe the holy privilege
Dialogue#CARDINAL=Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
Dialogue#CARDINAL=Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Too ceremonious and traditional
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=The benefit thereof is always granted
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And those who have the wit to claim the place:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=You break no privilege nor charter there.

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=For your best health and recreation.
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=I do not like the Tower, of any place.
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=Is it upon record, or else reported
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=Successively from age to age, he built it?
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Upon record, my gracious lord.
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=[Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=live long.
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=What say you, uncle?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I say, without characters, fame lives long.
Notice#Aside
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I moralize two meanings in one word.
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=With what his valour did enrich his wit,
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=His wit set down to make his valour live
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=What, my gracious lord?

Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=Too late he died that might have kept that title,
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
Dialogue#YORK=I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
Dialogue#YORK=You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
Dialogue#YORK=The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=He hath, my lord.
Dialogue#YORK=                  And therefore is he idle?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
Dialogue#YORK=Then is he more beholding to you than I.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=He may command me as my sovereign;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
Dialogue#YORK=I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=A beggar, brother?
Dialogue#YORK=Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
Dialogue#YORK=A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=A gentle cousin, were it light enough.
Dialogue#YORK=O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
Dialogue#YORK=In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
Dialogue#YORK=I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
Dialogue#YORK=I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=How?
Dialogue#YORK=Little.
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.
Dialogue#YORK=You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
Dialogue#YORK=Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
Dialogue#YORK=Because that I am little, like an ape,
Dialogue#YORK=He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=So cunning and so young is wonderful.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=My lord, will't please you pass along?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Will to your mother, to entreat of her
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
Dialogue#YORK=What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=My lord protector needs will have it so.
Dialogue#YORK=I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Why, what should you fear?
Dialogue#YORK=Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
Dialogue#YORK=My grandam told me he was murdered there.
Dialogue#PRINCE EDWARD=I fear no uncles dead.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Nor none that live, I hope.

Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=To sit about the coronation.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=If thou dost find him tractable to us,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And give us notice of his inclination:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.

Dialogue#HASTINGS=I would be so triumphant as I am?
Dialogue#STANLEY=The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
Dialogue#STANLEY=Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
Dialogue#STANLEY=And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
Dialogue#STANLEY=But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
Dialogue#STANLEY=This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
Dialogue#STANLEY=Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
Dialogue#STANLEY=What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
Dialogue#HASTINGS=To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I took him for the plainest harmless creature
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The history of all her secret thoughts:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=He lived from all attainder of suspect.

Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=This day had plotted, in the council-house
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
Dialogue#Lord Mayor=What, had he so?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Or that we would, against the form of law,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But that the extreme peril of the case,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The peace of England and our persons' safety,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Enforced us to this execution?
Dialogue#Lord Mayor=Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
Dialogue#Lord Mayor=And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
Dialogue#Lord Mayor=To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
Dialogue#Lord Mayor=I never look'd for better at his hands,
Dialogue#Lord Mayor=After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Yet had not we determined he should die,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Until your lordship came to see his death;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The traitor speak, and timorously confess
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The manner and the purpose of his treason;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=That you might well have signified the same
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Unto the citizens, who haply may
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
Dialogue#Lord Mayor=But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
Dialogue#Lord Mayor=As well as I had seen and heard him speak
Dialogue#Lord Mayor=And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
Dialogue#Lord Mayor=But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
Dialogue#Lord Mayor=With all your just proceedings in this cause.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=To avoid the carping censures of the world.

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Only for saying he would make his son
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And bestial appetite in change of lust;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Without control, listed to make his prey.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Tell them, when that my mother went with child
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=My princely father then had wars in France
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=And, by just computation of the time,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Found that the issue was not his begot;
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Which well appeared in his lineaments,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.

Dialogue#Scrivener=And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
Dialogue#Scrivener=Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
Dialogue#Scrivener=For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;
Dialogue#Scrivener=The precedent was full as long a-doing:
Dialogue#Scrivener=And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,
Dialogue#Scrivener=Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
Dialogue#Scrivener=Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
Dialogue#Scrivener=That seeth not this palpable device?

Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=The citizens are mum and speak not a word.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And his contract by deputy in France;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=The insatiate greediness of his desires,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And his enforcement of the city wives;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=As being got, your father then in France,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=His resemblance, being not like the duke;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Withal I did infer your lineaments,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Being the right idea of your father,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose

Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And when mine oratory grew to an end
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=I bid them that did love their country's good
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Ah! and did they so?
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=His answer was, the people were not wont
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=To be spoke to but by the recorder.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM='Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=When he had done, some followers of mine own,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And thus I took the vantage of those few,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM='Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM='This general applause and loving shout
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And even here brake off, and came away.

Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=No, by my troth, my lord.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;

Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And be not easily won to our request:

Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=But meditating with two deep divines;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Happy were England, would this gracious prince
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Neglect the visitation of my friends.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,

Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And by their vehement instigation,

Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Attend the sequel of your imposition,
