Dialogue#Second Servant=Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.
Dialogue#SLY=These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
Dialogue#SLY=But did I never speak of all that time?
Dialogue#First Servant=O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:
Dialogue#First Servant=For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,

Dialogue#SLY=Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
Dialogue#Third Servant=Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
Dialogue#Third Servant=Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,

Dialogue#TRANIO=Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
Dialogue#TRANIO=I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
Dialogue#TRANIO=Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
Dialogue#TRANIO=Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
Dialogue#TRANIO=That till the father rid his hands of her,
Dialogue#TRANIO=Master, your love must live a maid at home;
Dialogue#TRANIO=And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
Dialogue#TRANIO=Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=But art thou not advised, he took some care
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
Dialogue#TRANIO=Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=I have it, Tranio.
Dialogue#TRANIO=                  Master, for my hand,
Dialogue#TRANIO=Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Tell me thine first.
Dialogue#TRANIO=You will be schoolmaster
Dialogue#TRANIO=And undertake the teaching of the maid:
Dialogue#TRANIO=That's your device.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=It is: may it be done?
Dialogue#TRANIO=Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
Dialogue#TRANIO=And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
Dialogue#TRANIO=Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
Dialogue#TRANIO=Visit his countrymen and banquet them?
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Basta; content thee, for I have it full.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=We have not yet been seen in any house,
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=For man or master; then it follows thus;
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Keep house and port and servants as I should:
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=I will some other be, some Florentine,
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO='Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
Dialogue#TRANIO=So had you need.
Dialogue#TRANIO=In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
Dialogue#TRANIO=And I am tied to be obedient;
Dialogue#TRANIO=For so your father charged me at our parting,
Dialogue#TRANIO='Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
Dialogue#TRANIO=Although I think 'twas in another sense;
Dialogue#TRANIO=I am content to be Lucentio,
Dialogue#TRANIO=Because so well I love Lucentio.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Here comes the rogue.

Dialogue#BIONDELLO=Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
Dialogue#BIONDELLO=you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=And therefore frame your manners to the time.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=And I for my escape have put on his;
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=For in a quarrel since I came ashore
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=While I make way from hence to save my life:
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=You understand me?
Dialogue#BIONDELLO=                  I, sir! ne'er a whit.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
Dialogue#BIONDELLO=The better for him: would I were so too!
Dialogue#TRANIO=So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
Dialogue#TRANIO=That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
Dialogue#TRANIO=But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
Dialogue#TRANIO=You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
Dialogue#TRANIO=When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
Dialogue#TRANIO=But in all places else your master Lucentio.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that

Dialogue#GRUMIO=Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has
Dialogue#GRUMIO=rebused your worship?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
Dialogue#GRUMIO=Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
Dialogue#GRUMIO=I should knock you here, sir?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
Dialogue#GRUMIO=My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
Dialogue#GRUMIO=you first,
Dialogue#GRUMIO=And then I know after who comes by the worst.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Will it not be?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.

Dialogue#HORTENSIO=and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO='Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO='Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=this quarrel.
Dialogue#GRUMIO=Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
Dialogue#GRUMIO=if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
Dialogue#GRUMIO=service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap
Dialogue#GRUMIO=him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to
Dialogue#GRUMIO=use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,
Dialogue#GRUMIO=two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had
Dialogue#GRUMIO=well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And could not get him for my heart to do it.
Dialogue#GRUMIO=Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
Dialogue#GRUMIO=words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,
Dialogue#GRUMIO=knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
Dialogue#GRUMIO=now with, 'knocking at the gate'?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.

Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=To seek their fortunes farther than at home
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Where small experience grows. But in a few,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Antonio, my father, is deceased;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And I have thrust myself into this maze,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And so am come abroad to see the world.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And I'll not wish thee to her.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
Dialogue#GRUMIO=Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his
Dialogue#GRUMIO=mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
Dialogue#GRUMIO=a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er
Dialogue#GRUMIO=a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases
Dialogue#GRUMIO=as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,
Dialogue#GRUMIO=so money comes withal.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=With wealth enough and young and beauteous,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Is that she is intolerable curst
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=That, were my state far worser than it is,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=For I will board her, though she chide as loud
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Her father is Baptista Minola,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=An affable and courteous gentleman:
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Her name is Katharina Minola,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I know her father, though I know not her;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And he knew my deceased father well.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And therefore let me be thus bold with you
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=To give you over at this first encounter,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Unless you will accompany me thither.
Dialogue#GRUMIO=I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.
Dialogue#GRUMIO=O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she
Dialogue#GRUMIO=would think scolding would do little good upon him:
Dialogue#GRUMIO=she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
Dialogue#GRUMIO=why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in
Dialogue#GRUMIO=his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she
Dialogue#GRUMIO=stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
Dialogue#GRUMIO=her face and so disfigure her with it that she
Dialogue#GRUMIO=shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
Dialogue#GRUMIO=You know him not, sir.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And her withholds from me and other more,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Suitors to her and rivals in my love,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Supposing it a thing impossible,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=For those defects I have before rehearsed,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=That ever Katharina will be woo'd;
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=That none shall have access unto Bianca
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.
Dialogue#GRUMIO=Katharina the curst!
Dialogue#GRUMIO=A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And offer me disguised in sober robes
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=That so I may, by this device, at least
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Have leave and leisure to make love to her
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And unsuspected court her by herself.
Dialogue#GRUMIO=Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,
Dialogue#GRUMIO=how the young folks lay their heads together!
Notice#Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised
Dialogue#GRUMIO=Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Petruchio, stand by a while.
Dialogue#GRUMIO=A proper stripling and an amorous!
Dialogue#GREMIO=O, very well; I have perused the note.
Dialogue#GREMIO=Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:
Dialogue#GREMIO=All books of love, see that at any hand;
Dialogue#GREMIO=And see you read no other lectures to her:
Dialogue#GREMIO=You understand me: over and beside
Dialogue#GREMIO=Signior Baptista's liberality,
Dialogue#GREMIO=I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
Dialogue#GREMIO=And let me have them very well perfumed
Dialogue#GREMIO=For she is sweeter than perfume itself
Dialogue#GREMIO=To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=As for my patron, stand you so assured,
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=As firmly as yourself were still in place:
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
Dialogue#GREMIO=O this learning, what a thing it is!
Dialogue#GRUMIO=O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Peace, sirrah!
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.
Dialogue#GREMIO=And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
Dialogue#GREMIO=Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
Dialogue#GREMIO=I promised to inquire carefully
Dialogue#GREMIO=About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
Dialogue#GREMIO=And by good fortune I have lighted well
Dialogue#GREMIO=On this young man, for learning and behavior
Dialogue#GREMIO=Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
Dialogue#GREMIO=And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO='Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Hath promised me to help me to another,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=So shall I no whit be behind in duty
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
Dialogue#GREMIO=Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.
Dialogue#GRUMIO=And that his bags shall prove.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Upon agreement from us to his liking,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.
Dialogue#GREMIO=So said, so done, is well.
Dialogue#GREMIO=Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
Dialogue#GREMIO=No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And I do hope good days and long to see.
Dialogue#GREMIO=O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
Dialogue#GREMIO=But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:
Dialogue#GREMIO=You shall have me assisting you in all.
Dialogue#GREMIO=But will you woo this wild-cat?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Will I live?
Dialogue#GRUMIO=Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Why came I hither but to that intent?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Have I not in a pitched battle heard
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=That gives not half so great a blow to hear
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.
Dialogue#GRUMIO=For he fears none.
Dialogue#GREMIO=Hortensio, hark:
Dialogue#GREMIO=This gentleman is happily arrived,
Dialogue#GREMIO=My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=I promised we would be contributors
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.
Dialogue#GREMIO=And so we will, provided that he win her.

Dialogue#GREMIO=Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--

Dialogue#TRANIO=For me as for you?
Dialogue#GREMIO=                  But so is not she.
Dialogue#TRANIO=For what reason, I beseech you?
Dialogue#GREMIO=For this reason, if you'll know,

Dialogue#HORTENSIO=That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
Dialogue#TRANIO=Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,

Dialogue#TRANIO=Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
Dialogue#TRANIO=And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,

Dialogue#TRANIO=As is the other for beauteous modesty.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
Dialogue#GREMIO=Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;

Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I see you do not mean to part with her,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Or else you like not of my company.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=A man well known throughout all Italy.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
Dialogue#GREMIO=Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
Dialogue#GREMIO=Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
Dialogue#GREMIO=Baccare! you are marvellous forward.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.
Dialogue#GREMIO=I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
Dialogue#GREMIO=wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
Dialogue#GREMIO=sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,

Dialogue#GREMIO=any, freely give unto you this young scholar,

Dialogue#GREMIO=accept his service.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Welcome, good Cambio.
Notice#To TRANIO
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
Dialogue#TRANIO=Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
Dialogue#TRANIO=That, being a stranger in this city here,
Dialogue#TRANIO=Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
Dialogue#TRANIO=Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
Dialogue#TRANIO=Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
Dialogue#TRANIO=In the preferment of the eldest sister.
Dialogue#TRANIO=This liberty is all that I request,
Dialogue#TRANIO=That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
Dialogue#TRANIO=I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
Dialogue#TRANIO=And free access and favour as the rest:
Dialogue#TRANIO=And, toward the education of your daughters,
Dialogue#TRANIO=I here bestow a simple instrument,

Notice#Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO, BIONDELLO following
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=We will go walk a little in the orchard,
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And every day I cannot come to woo.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=You knew my father well, and in him me,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=After my death the one half of my lands,
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=And in possession twenty thousand crowns.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=That covenants may be kept on either hand.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=That is, her love; for that is all in all.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And where two raging fires meet together
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Though little fire grows great with little wind,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=So I to her and so she yields to me;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=That shake not, though they blow perpetually.
Notice#Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO='Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=with them:'
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And through the instrument my pate made way;
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And there I stood amazed for a while,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=While she did call me rascal fiddler
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=As had she studied to misuse me so.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=O, how I long to have some chat with her!
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I pray you do.
Notice#Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I will attend her here,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Then I'll commend her volubility,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=As though she bid me stay by her a week:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
Notice#Enter KATHARINA
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
Dialogue#KATHARINA=They call me Katharina that do talk of me.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
Dialogue#KATHARINA=You were a moveable.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Why, what's a moveable?
Dialogue#KATHARINA=A join'd-stool.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Women are made to bear, and so are you.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=No such jade as you, if me you mean.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=For, knowing thee to be but young and light--
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
Dialogue#KATHARINA=And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Should be! should--buzz!
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=My remedy is then, to pluck it out.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Who knows not where a wasp does
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=wear his sting? In his tail.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=In his tongue.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Whose tongue?
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Good Kate; I am a gentleman.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=That I'll try.
Notice#She strikes him
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=So may you lose your arms:
Dialogue#KATHARINA=If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
Dialogue#KATHARINA=And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
Dialogue#KATHARINA=What is your crest? a coxcomb?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=There is, there is.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Then show it me.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Had I a glass, I would.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=What, you mean my face?
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Well aim'd of such a young one.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Yet you are wither'd.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO='Tis with cares.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=I care not.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO='Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And now I find report a very liar;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=With gentle conference, soft and affable.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Did ever Dian so become a grove
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Where did you study all this goodly speech?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=It is extempore, from my mother-wit.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=A witty mother! witless else her son.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Am I not wise?
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Yes; keep you warm.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Thou must be married to no man but me;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Conformable as other household Kates.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Here comes your father: never make denial;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I must and will have Katharina to my wife.
Notice#Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=How but well, sir? how but well?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=It were impossible I should speed amiss.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
Dialogue#KATHARINA=You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
Dialogue#KATHARINA=A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=If she be curst, it is for policy,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
Dialogue#GREMIO=Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
Dialogue#GREMIO=hang'd first.
Dialogue#TRANIO=Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO='Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=That she shall still be curst in company.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=That in a twink she won me to her love.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=How tame, when men and women are alone,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.
Dialogue#TRANIO=Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=We will have rings and things and fine array;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.
Notice#Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally
Dialogue#GREMIO=Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=And venture madly on a desperate mart.
Dialogue#TRANIO='Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
Dialogue#TRANIO='Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.
Dialogue#GREMIO=No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
Dialogue#GREMIO=But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:
Dialogue#GREMIO=Now is the day we long have looked for:
Dialogue#GREMIO=I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
Dialogue#TRANIO=And I am one that love Bianca more
Dialogue#TRANIO=Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.
Dialogue#GREMIO=Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
Dialogue#TRANIO=Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.
Dialogue#GREMIO=But thine doth fry.
Dialogue#GREMIO=Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.
Dialogue#TRANIO=But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
Dialogue#BAPTISTA='Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Shall have my Bianca's love.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?
Dialogue#GREMIO=First, as you know, my house within the city
Dialogue#GREMIO=Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
Dialogue#GREMIO=Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
Dialogue#GREMIO=My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
Dialogue#GREMIO=In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
Dialogue#GREMIO=In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
Dialogue#GREMIO=Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
Dialogue#GREMIO=Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
Dialogue#GREMIO=Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
Dialogue#GREMIO=Pewter and brass and all things that belong
Dialogue#GREMIO=To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
Dialogue#GREMIO=I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Dialogue#GREMIO=Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
Dialogue#GREMIO=And all things answerable to this portion.
Dialogue#GREMIO=Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
Dialogue#GREMIO=And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
Dialogue#GREMIO=If whilst I live she will be only mine.
Dialogue#TRANIO=That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
Dialogue#TRANIO=I am my father's heir and only son:
Dialogue#TRANIO=If I may have your daughter to my wife,
Dialogue#TRANIO=I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
Dialogue#TRANIO=Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
Dialogue#TRANIO=Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Dialogue#TRANIO=Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Dialogue#TRANIO=Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
Dialogue#TRANIO=What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
Dialogue#GREMIO=Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
Dialogue#GREMIO=My land amounts not to so much in all:
Dialogue#GREMIO=That she shall have; besides an argosy
Dialogue#GREMIO=That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
Dialogue#GREMIO=What, have I choked you with an argosy?
Dialogue#TRANIO=Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
Dialogue#TRANIO=Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,
Dialogue#TRANIO=And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,
Dialogue#TRANIO=And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.
Dialogue#GREMIO=Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
Dialogue#GREMIO=And she can have no more than all I have:
Dialogue#GREMIO=If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
Dialogue#TRANIO=Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
Dialogue#TRANIO=By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=I must confess your offer is the best;
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=And, let your father make her the assurance,
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=She is your own; else, you must pardon me,
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=if you should die before him, where's her dower?
Dialogue#TRANIO=That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.
Dialogue#GREMIO=And may not young men die, as well as old?
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Well, gentlemen,
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=My daughter Katharina is to be married:
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Be bride to you, if you this assurance;
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=If not, Signior Gremio:
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.
Dialogue#GREMIO=Adieu, good neighbour.
Notice#Exit BAPTISTA
Dialogue#GREMIO=Now I fear thee not:

Dialogue#GREMIO=An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#TRANIO=A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
Dialogue#TRANIO=Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
Dialogue#TRANIO='Tis in my head to do my master good:
Dialogue#TRANIO=I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
Dialogue#TRANIO=Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
Dialogue#TRANIO=And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
Dialogue#TRANIO=Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
Dialogue#TRANIO=A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=But, wrangling pedant, this is
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=The patroness of heavenly harmony:
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Then give me leave to have prerogative;
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And when in music we have spent an hour,
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Preposterous ass, that never read so far
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Was it not to refresh the mind of man
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=After his studies or his usual pain?

Dialogue#TRANIO=What said the wench when he rose again?
Dialogue#GREMIO=Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
Dialogue#GREMIO=As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
Dialogue#GREMIO=But after many ceremonies done,
Dialogue#GREMIO=He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
Dialogue#GREMIO=He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
Dialogue#GREMIO=After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
Dialogue#GREMIO=And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
Dialogue#GREMIO=Having no other reason
Dialogue#GREMIO=But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
Dialogue#GREMIO=And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
Dialogue#GREMIO=This done, he took the bride about the neck
Dialogue#GREMIO=And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
Dialogue#GREMIO=That at the parting all the church did echo:

Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Now, where's my wife?
Dialogue#BIONDELLO=She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
Dialogue#BIONDELLO=She will not come: she bids you come to her.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Intolerable, not to be endured!
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Say, I command her to come to me.
Notice#Exit GRUMIO
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=I know her answer.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=                  What?
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=She will not.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!
Notice#Re-enter KATARINA
Dialogue#KATHARINA=What is your will, sir, that you send for me?
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
Dialogue#KATHARINA=They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
Notice#Exit KATHARINA
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And awful rule and right supremacy;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=The wager thou hast won; and I will add
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=Another dowry to another daughter,
Dialogue#BAPTISTA=For she is changed, as she had never been.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Nay, I will win my wager better yet
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And show more sign of her obedience,
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Her new-built virtue and obedience.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=See where she comes and brings your froward wives
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
Notice#Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.
Dialogue#Widow=Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
Dialogue#Widow=Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
Dialogue#BIANCA=Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=I would your duty were as foolish too:
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.
Dialogue#BIANCA=The more fool you, for laying on my duty.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
Dialogue#Widow=Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
Dialogue#Widow=She shall not.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=I say she shall: and first begin with her.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
Dialogue#KATHARINA=It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=And in no sense is meet or amiable.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
Dialogue#KATHARINA=And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=And for thy maintenance commits his body
Dialogue#KATHARINA=To painful labour both by sea and land,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
Dialogue#KATHARINA=And craves no other tribute at thy hands
Dialogue#KATHARINA=But love, fair looks and true obedience;
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Too little payment for so great a debt.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Such duty as the subject owes the prince
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
Dialogue#KATHARINA=And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=And not obedient to his honest will,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=What is she but a foul contending rebel
Dialogue#KATHARINA=And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
Dialogue#KATHARINA=I am ashamed that women are so simple
Dialogue#KATHARINA=To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Should well agree with our external parts?
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
Dialogue#KATHARINA=My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=My heart as great, my reason haply more,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
Dialogue#KATHARINA=But now I see our lances are but straws,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Dialogue#KATHARINA=Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=And place your hands below your husband's foot:
Dialogue#KATHARINA=In token of which duty, if he please,
Dialogue#KATHARINA=My hand is ready; may it do him ease.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.
Dialogue#VINCENTIO='Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO=But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=We three are married, but you two are sped.
Notice#To LUCENTIO
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO='Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
Dialogue#PETRUCHIO=And, being a winner, God give you good night!
Notice#Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA
Dialogue#HORTENSIO=Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.
Dialogue#LUCENTIO='Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.
Notice#Exeunt
