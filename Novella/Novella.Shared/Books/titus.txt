Dialogue#CHIRON=And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!
Dialogue#AARON=Away, I say!
Dialogue#AARON=Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,
Dialogue#AARON=This petty brabble will undo us all.
Dialogue#AARON=Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous
Dialogue#AARON=It is to jet upon a prince's right?
Dialogue#AARON=What, is Lavinia then become so loose,
Dialogue#AARON=Or Bassianus so degenerate,
Dialogue#AARON=That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
Dialogue#AARON=Without controlment, justice, or revenge?
Dialogue#AARON=Young lords, beware! and should the empress know

Dialogue#CHIRON=Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.
Dialogue#AARON=To achieve her! how?
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Why makest thou it so strange?
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=She is a woman, therefore may be won;
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=What, man! more water glideth by the mill
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Than wots the miller of; and easy it is
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:

Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
Dialogue#AARON=Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so
Dialogue#AARON=Would serve your turns.
Dialogue#CHIRON=Ay, so the turn were served.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Aaron, thou hast hit it.
Dialogue#AARON=Would you had hit it too!

Dialogue#CHIRON=Faith, not me.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=                  Nor me, so I were one.

Dialogue#AARON='Tis policy and stratagem must do
Dialogue#AARON=That you affect; and so must you resolve,
Dialogue#AARON=That what you cannot as you would achieve,
Dialogue#AARON=You must perforce accomplish as you may.

Dialogue#AARON=Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.
Dialogue#AARON=A speedier course than lingering languishment
Dialogue#AARON=Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
Dialogue#AARON=My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;
Dialogue#AARON=There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
Dialogue#AARON=The forest walks are wide and spacious;
Dialogue#AARON=And many unfrequented plots there are
Dialogue#AARON=Fitted by kind for rape and villany:
Dialogue#AARON=Single you thither then this dainty doe,
Dialogue#AARON=And strike her home by force, if not by words:
Dialogue#AARON=This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.
Dialogue#AARON=Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit
Dialogue#AARON=To villany and vengeance consecrate,
Dialogue#AARON=Will we acquaint with all that we intend;
Dialogue#AARON=And she shall file our engines with advice,
Dialogue#AARON=That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
Dialogue#AARON=But to your wishes' height advance you both.
Dialogue#AARON=The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,
Dialogue#AARON=The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:
Dialogue#AARON=The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;
Dialogue#AARON=There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take
Dialogue#AARON=your turns;
Dialogue#AARON=There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,
Dialogue#AARON=And revel in Lavinia's treasury.
Dialogue#CHIRON=Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,

Dialogue#LUCIUS=Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey
Dialogue#LUCIUS=This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?
Dialogue#LUCIUS=A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
Dialogue#AARON=Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Too like the sire for ever being good.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;
Dialogue#LUCIUS=A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Get me a ladder.
Notice#A ladder brought, which AARON is made to ascend
Dialogue#AARON=                  Lucius, save the child,
Dialogue#AARON=And bear it from me to the empress.
Dialogue#AARON=If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,
Dialogue#AARON=That highly may advantage thee to hear:
Dialogue#AARON=If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
Dialogue#AARON=I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.
Dialogue#AARON=An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,
Dialogue#AARON='Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
Dialogue#AARON=For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,
Dialogue#AARON=Acts of black night, abominable deeds,
Dialogue#AARON=Complots of mischief, treason, villanies
Dialogue#AARON=Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:
Dialogue#AARON=And this shall all be buried by my death,
Dialogue#AARON=Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
Dialogue#AARON=Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:
Dialogue#LUCIUS=That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
Dialogue#AARON=What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;
Dialogue#AARON=Yet, for I know thou art religious
Dialogue#AARON=And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
Dialogue#AARON=With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,
Dialogue#AARON=Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
Dialogue#AARON=Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know
Dialogue#AARON=An idiot holds his bauble for a god
Dialogue#AARON=And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
Dialogue#AARON=To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow
Dialogue#AARON=By that same god, what god soe'er it be,
Dialogue#AARON=That thou adorest and hast in reverence,
Dialogue#AARON=To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;
Dialogue#AARON=Or else I will discover nought to thee.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
Dialogue#AARON=First know thou, I begot him on the empress.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
Dialogue#AARON=Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
Dialogue#AARON=To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
Dialogue#AARON='Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;
Dialogue#AARON=They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her
Dialogue#AARON=And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?
Dialogue#AARON=Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas
Dialogue#AARON=Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!
Dialogue#AARON=Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:
Dialogue#AARON=That codding spirit had they from their mother,
Dialogue#AARON=As sure a card as ever won the set;
Dialogue#AARON=That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,
Dialogue#AARON=As true a dog as ever fought at head.
Dialogue#AARON=Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
Dialogue#AARON=I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
Dialogue#AARON=Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:
Dialogue#AARON=I wrote the letter that thy father found
Dialogue#AARON=And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,
Dialogue#AARON=Confederate with the queen and her two sons:
Dialogue#AARON=And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
Dialogue#AARON=Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
Dialogue#AARON=I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,
Dialogue#AARON=And, when I had it, drew myself apart
Dialogue#AARON=And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:
Dialogue#AARON=I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
Dialogue#AARON=When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;
Dialogue#AARON=Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,
Dialogue#AARON=That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :
Dialogue#AARON=And when I told the empress of this sport,
Dialogue#AARON=She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,
Dialogue#AARON=And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.
Dialogue#First Goth=What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?
Dialogue#AARON=Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
Dialogue#AARON=Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
Dialogue#AARON=Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
Dialogue#AARON=Few come within the compass of my curse,--
Dialogue#AARON=Wherein I did not some notorious ill,
Dialogue#AARON=As kill a man, or else devise his death,
Dialogue#AARON=Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,
Dialogue#AARON=Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,
Dialogue#AARON=Set deadly enmity between two friends,
Dialogue#AARON=Make poor men's cattle break their necks;
Dialogue#AARON=Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,
Dialogue#AARON=And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
Dialogue#AARON=Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
Dialogue#AARON=And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,
Dialogue#AARON=Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;
Dialogue#AARON=And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
Dialogue#AARON=Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,
Dialogue#AARON='Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'
Dialogue#AARON=Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
Dialogue#AARON=As willingly as one would kill a fly,
Dialogue#AARON=And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
Dialogue#AARON=But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Bring down the devil; for he must not die
Dialogue#LUCIUS=So sweet a death as hanging presently.
Dialogue#AARON=If there be devils, would I were a devil,
Dialogue#AARON=To live and burn in everlasting fire,
Dialogue#AARON=So I might have your company in hell,
Dialogue#AARON=But to torment you with my bitter tongue!
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.

Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Do shameful execution on herself.
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Grave witnesses of true experience,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Cannot induce you to attend my words,
Notice#To LUCIUS
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=The story of that baleful burning night
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=But floods of tears will drown my oratory,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=And break my utterance, even in the time
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=When it should move you to attend me most,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Lending your kind commiseration.
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=That cursed Chiron and Demetrius
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;
Dialogue#LUCIUS=And they it were that ravished our sister:
Dialogue#LUCIUS=For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=And sent her enemies unto the grave.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=To beg relief among Rome's enemies:
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=I am the turned forth, be it known to you,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=That have preserved her welfare in my blood;
Dialogue#LUCIUS=And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;
Dialogue#LUCIUS=My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=That my report is just and full of truth.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;
Dialogue#LUCIUS=For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:
Notice#Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Of this was Tamora delivered;
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=The issue of an irreligious Moor,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Chief architect and plotter of these woes:
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=The villain is alive in Titus' house,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=And as he is, to witness this is true.
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Or more than any living man could bear.
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Have we done aught amiss,--show us wherein,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=And, from the place where you behold us now,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=The poor remainder of Andronici
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=And make a mutual closure of our house.
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.
Dialogue#AEMILIUS=Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,
Dialogue#AEMILIUS=And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,
Dialogue#AEMILIUS=Lucius our emperor; for well I know
Dialogue#AEMILIUS=The common voice do cry it shall be so.
Dialogue#All=Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,
Notice#To Attendants
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=As punishment for his most wicked life.
Notice#Exeunt Attendants
Notice#LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend
Dialogue#All=Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!
Dialogue#LUCIUS=But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=For nature puts me to a heavy task:
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
Notice#Kissing TITUS
Dialogue#LUCIUS=These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=The last true duties of thy noble son!
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=O were the sum of these that I should pay
Dialogue#MARCUS ANDRONICUS=Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us
Dialogue#LUCIUS=To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Many a time he danced thee on his knee,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Many a matter hath he told to thee,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;
Dialogue#LUCIUS=In that respect, then, like a loving child,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Because kind nature doth require it so:
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.
Dialogue#Young LUCIUS=O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart
Dialogue#Young LUCIUS=Would I were dead, so you did live again!
Dialogue#Young LUCIUS=O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;
Dialogue#Young LUCIUS=My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.
Notice#Re-enter Attendants with AARON
Dialogue#AEMILIUS=You sad Andronici, have done with woes:
Dialogue#AEMILIUS=Give sentence on this execrable wretch,
Dialogue#AEMILIUS=That hath been breeder of these dire events.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
Dialogue#LUCIUS=There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;
Dialogue#LUCIUS=If any one relieves or pities him,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=For the offence he dies. This is our doom:
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.
Dialogue#AARON=O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
Dialogue#AARON=I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
Dialogue#AARON=I should repent the evils I have done:
Dialogue#AARON=Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
Dialogue#AARON=Would I perform, if I might have my will;
Dialogue#AARON=If one good deed in all my life I did,
Dialogue#AARON=I do repent it from my very soul.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=And give him burial in his father's grave:
Dialogue#LUCIUS=My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Be closed in our household's monument.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=No funeral rite, nor man m mourning weeds,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
Dialogue#LUCIUS=But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;
Dialogue#LUCIUS=And, being so, shall have like want of pity.
Dialogue#LUCIUS=See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:
Dialogue#LUCIUS=Then, afterwards, to order well the state,
Dialogue#LUCIUS=That like events may ne'er it ruinate.
