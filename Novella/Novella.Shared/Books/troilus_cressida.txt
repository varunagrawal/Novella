Banner:PROLOGUE
Dialogue:PROSPERO=In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece
Dialogue:PROSPERO=The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Fraught with the ministers and instruments
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made
Dialogue:PROSPERO=To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures
Dialogue:PROSPERO=The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,
Dialogue:PROSPERO=With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.
Dialogue:PROSPERO=To Tenedos they come;
Dialogue:PROSPERO=And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
Dialogue:PROSPERO=The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,
Dialogue:PROSPERO=And Antenorides, with massy staples
Dialogue:PROSPERO=And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Sperr up the sons of Troy.
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,
Dialogue:PROSPERO=On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come
Dialogue:PROSPERO=A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited
Dialogue:PROSPERO=In like conditions as our argument,
Dialogue:PROSPERO=To tell you, fair beholders, that our play
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Beginning in the middle, starting thence away
Dialogue:PROSPERO=To what may be digested in a play.
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:
Dialogue:PROSPERO=Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.
Banner:SCENE I. Troy. Before Priam's palace.
Notice:Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS
Dialogue:TROILUS=Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:
Dialogue:TROILUS=Why should I war without the walls of Troy,
Dialogue:TROILUS=That find such cruel battle here within?
Dialogue:TROILUS=Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Will this gear ne'er be mended?
Dialogue:TROILUS=The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;
Dialogue:TROILUS=But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Less valiant than the virgin in the night
Dialogue:TROILUS=And skilless as unpractised infancy.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,
Dialogue:PANDARUS=I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will
Dialogue:PANDARUS=have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Have I not tarried?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry
Dialogue:PANDARUS=the bolting.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Have I not tarried?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Still have I tarried.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word
Dialogue:PANDARUS='hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the
Dialogue:PANDARUS=heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must
Dialogue:PANDARUS=stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.
Dialogue:TROILUS=At Priam's royal table do I sit;
Dialogue:TROILUS=And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--
Dialogue:TROILUS=So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw
Dialogue:PANDARUS=her look, or any woman else.
Dialogue:TROILUS=I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,
Dialogue:TROILUS=As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,
Dialogue:TROILUS=I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:
Dialogue:TROILUS=But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--
Dialogue:PANDARUS=well, go to--there were no more comparison between
Dialogue:PANDARUS=the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I
Dialogue:PANDARUS=would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would
Dialogue:PANDARUS=somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I
Dialogue:PANDARUS=will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--
Dialogue:TROILUS=O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--
Dialogue:TROILUS=When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Reply not in how many fathoms deep
Dialogue:TROILUS=They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad
Dialogue:TROILUS=In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'
Dialogue:TROILUS=Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
Dialogue:TROILUS=Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,
Dialogue:TROILUS=In whose comparison all whites are ink,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure
Dialogue:TROILUS=The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
Dialogue:TROILUS=Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,
Dialogue:TROILUS=As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;
Dialogue:TROILUS=But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
Dialogue:TROILUS=The knife that made it.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=I speak no more than truth.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Thou dost not speak so much.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:
Dialogue:PANDARUS=if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be
Dialogue:PANDARUS=not, she has the mends in her own hands.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!
Dialogue:PANDARUS=I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of
Dialogue:PANDARUS=her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and
Dialogue:PANDARUS=between, but small thanks for my labour.
Dialogue:TROILUS=What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair
Dialogue:PANDARUS=as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as
Dialogue:PANDARUS=fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care
Dialogue:PANDARUS=I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Say I she is not fair?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to
Dialogue:PANDARUS=stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so
Dialogue:PANDARUS=I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,
Dialogue:PANDARUS=I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Pandarus,--
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Not I.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Sweet Pandarus,--
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I
Dialogue:PANDARUS=found it, and there an end.
Notice:Exit PANDARUS. An alarum
Dialogue:TROILUS=Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
Dialogue:TROILUS=Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,
Dialogue:TROILUS=When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
Dialogue:TROILUS=I cannot fight upon this argument;
Dialogue:TROILUS=It is too starved a subject for my sword.
Dialogue:TROILUS=But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!
Dialogue:TROILUS=I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;
Dialogue:TROILUS=And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.
Dialogue:TROILUS=As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,
Dialogue:TROILUS=What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?
Dialogue:TROILUS=Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:
Dialogue:TROILUS=Between our Ilium and where she resides,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar
Dialogue:TROILUS=Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.
Notice:Alarum. Enter AENEAS
Dialogue:AENEAS=How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?
Dialogue:TROILUS=Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,
Dialogue:TROILUS=For womanish it is to be from thence.
Dialogue:TROILUS=What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?
Dialogue:AENEAS=That Paris is returned home and hurt.
Dialogue:TROILUS=By whom, AEneas?
Dialogue:AENEAS=                  Troilus, by Menelaus.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;
Dialogue:TROILUS=Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.
Notice:Alarum
Dialogue:AENEAS=Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!
Dialogue:TROILUS=Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'
Dialogue:TROILUS=But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?
Dialogue:AENEAS=In all swift haste.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Come, go we then together.
Notice:Exeunt
Banner:SCENE II. The Same. A street.
Notice:Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Who were those went by?
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=Queen Hecuba and Helen.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=And whither go they?
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=Up to the eastern tower,
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=To see the battle. Hector, whose patience
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=And, like as there were husbandry in war,
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=And to the field goes he; where every flower
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=In Hector's wrath.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=                  What was his cause of anger?
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=They call him Ajax.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Good; and what of him?
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=They say he is a very man per se,
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=And stands alone.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=But how should this man, that makes
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=me smile, make Hector angry?
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Who comes here?
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=Madam, your uncle Pandarus.
Notice:Enter PANDARUS
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Hector's a gallant man.
Dialogue:ALEXANDER=As may be in the world, lady.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=What's that? what's that?
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When
Dialogue:PANDARUS=were you at Ilium?
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=This morning, uncle.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector
Dialogue:PANDARUS=armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not
Dialogue:PANDARUS=up, was she?
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Even so: Hector was stirring early.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=That were we talking of, and of his anger.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Was he angry?
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=So he says here.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay
Dialogue:PANDARUS=about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take
Dialogue:PANDARUS=heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=What, is he angry too?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a
Dialogue:PANDARUS=man if you see him?
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA='Tis just to each of them; he is himself.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=So he is.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=He is not Hector.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were
Dialogue:PANDARUS=himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend
Dialogue:PANDARUS=or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were
Dialogue:PANDARUS=in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Excuse me.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=He is elder.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Pardon me, pardon me.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another
Dialogue:PANDARUS=tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not
Dialogue:PANDARUS=have his wit this year.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=He shall not need it, if he have his own.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Nor his qualities.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=No matter.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Nor his beauty.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA='Twould not become him; his own's better.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=You have no judgment, niece: Helen
Dialogue:PANDARUS=herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for
Dialogue:PANDARUS=a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--
Dialogue:PANDARUS=not brown neither,--
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=No, but brown.
Dialogue:PANDARUS='Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=To say the truth, true and not true.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=She praised his complexion above Paris.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Why, Paris hath colour enough.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=So he has.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=him above, his complexion is higher than his; he
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=having colour enough, and the other higher, is too
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=a copper nose.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other
Dialogue:PANDARUS=day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he
Dialogue:PANDARUS=has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=particulars therein to a total.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within
Dialogue:PANDARUS=three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came
Dialogue:PANDARUS=and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling
Dialogue:PANDARUS=becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=O, he smiles valiantly.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Does he not?
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen
Dialogue:PANDARUS=loves Troilus,--
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=prove it so.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem
Dialogue:PANDARUS=an addle egg.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled
Dialogue:PANDARUS=his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I
Dialogue:PANDARUS=must needs confess,--
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Without the rack.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed
Dialogue:PANDARUS=that her eyes ran o'er.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=With mill-stones.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=And Cassandra laughed.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=But there was more temperate fire under the pot of
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=And Hector laughed.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=At what was all this laughing?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=too.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=What was his answer?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your
Dialogue:PANDARUS=chin, and one of them is white.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=This is her question.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and
Dialogue:PANDARUS=fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white
Dialogue:PANDARUS=hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'
Dialogue:PANDARUS='Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,
Dialogue:PANDARUS=my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't
Dialogue:PANDARUS=out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!
Dialogue:PANDARUS=and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the
Dialogue:PANDARUS=rest so laughed, that it passed.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=So let it now; for it has been while going by.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=So I do.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twere
Dialogue:PANDARUS=a man born in April.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=against May.
Notice:A retreat sounded
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we
Dialogue:PANDARUS=stand up here, and see them as they pass toward
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=At your pleasure.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may
Dialogue:PANDARUS=see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their
Dialogue:PANDARUS=names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Speak not so loud.
Notice:AENEAS passes
Dialogue:PANDARUS=That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of
Dialogue:PANDARUS=the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Troilus; you shall see anon.
Notice:ANTENOR passes
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Who's that?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;
Dialogue:PANDARUS=and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest
Dialogue:PANDARUS=judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if
Dialogue:PANDARUS=he see me, you shall see him nod at me.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Will he give you the nod?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=You shall see.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=If he do, the rich shall have more.
Notice:HECTOR passes
Dialogue:PANDARUS=That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a
Dialogue:PANDARUS=fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,
Dialogue:PANDARUS=niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
Dialogue:PANDARUS=a countenance! is't not a brave man?
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=O, a brave man!
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you
Dialogue:PANDARUS=what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do
Dialogue:PANDARUS=you see? look you there: there's no jesting;
Dialogue:PANDARUS=there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:
Dialogue:PANDARUS=there be hacks!
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Be those with swords?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil come
Dialogue:PANDARUS=to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's
Dialogue:PANDARUS=heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.
Notice:PARIS passes
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,
Dialogue:PANDARUS=is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came
Dialogue:PANDARUS=hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.
Notice:HELENUS passes
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Who's that?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Can Helenus fight, uncle?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I
Dialogue:PANDARUS=marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the
Dialogue:PANDARUS=people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
Notice:TROILUS passes
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!
Dialogue:PANDARUS=there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the
Dialogue:PANDARUS=prince of chivalry!
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Peace, for shame, peace!
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon
Dialogue:PANDARUS=him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and
Dialogue:PANDARUS=his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,
Dialogue:PANDARUS=and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw
Dialogue:PANDARUS=three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,
Dialogue:PANDARUS=he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to
Dialogue:PANDARUS=change, would give an eye to boot.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Here come more.
Notice:Forces pass
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
Dialogue:PANDARUS=porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the
Dialogue:PANDARUS=eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles
Dialogue:PANDARUS=are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had
Dialogue:PANDARUS=rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and
Dialogue:PANDARUS=all Greece.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Well, well.
Dialogue:PANDARUS='Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have
Dialogue:PANDARUS=you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not
Dialogue:PANDARUS=birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,
Dialogue:PANDARUS=learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,
Dialogue:PANDARUS=and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=in the pie, for then the man's date's out.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you
Dialogue:PANDARUS=lie.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=thousand watches.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Say one of your watches.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=past watching.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=You are such another!
Notice:Enter Troilus's Boy
Dialogue:Boy=Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Where?
Dialogue:Boy=At your own house; there he unarms him.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Good boy, tell him I come.
Notice:Exit boy
Dialogue:PANDARUS=I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Adieu, uncle.
Dialogue:PANDARUS=I'll be with you, niece, by and by.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=To bring, uncle?
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Ay, a token from Troilus.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=By the same token, you are a bawd.
Notice:Exit PANDARUS
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=He offers in another's enterprise;
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=That she was never yet that ever knew
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
Notice:Exeunt
Banner:SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.
Notice:Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES, MENELAUS, and others
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Princes,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=The ample proposition that hope makes
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=In all designs begun on earth below
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=That we come short of our suppose so far
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Sith every action that hath gone before,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Whereof we have record, trial did draw
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=And that unbodied figure of the thought
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=But the protractive trials of great Jove
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=To find persistive constancy in men:
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=The fineness of which metal is not found
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Puffing at all, winnows the light away;
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=And what hath mass or matter, by itself
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
Dialogue:NESTOR=With due observance of thy godlike seat,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
Dialogue:NESTOR=Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
Dialogue:NESTOR=Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,
Dialogue:NESTOR=How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
Dialogue:NESTOR=Upon her patient breast, making their way
Dialogue:NESTOR=With those of nobler bulk!
Dialogue:NESTOR=But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
Dialogue:NESTOR=The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
Dialogue:NESTOR=The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Bounding between the two moist elements,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
Dialogue:NESTOR=Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
Dialogue:NESTOR=Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
Dialogue:NESTOR=Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
Dialogue:NESTOR=In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
Dialogue:NESTOR=The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
Dialogue:NESTOR=Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
Dialogue:NESTOR=Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
Dialogue:NESTOR=And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage
Dialogue:NESTOR=As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,
Dialogue:NESTOR=And with an accent tuned in selfsame key
Dialogue:NESTOR=Retorts to chiding fortune.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Agamemnon,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=In whom the tempers and the minds of all
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Besides the applause and approbation To which,
Notice:To AGAMEMNON
Dialogue:ULYSSES=most mighty for thy place and sway,
Notice:To NESTOR
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life
Dialogue:ULYSSES=I give to both your speeches, which were such
Dialogue:ULYSSES=As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Should hold up high in brass, and such again
Dialogue:ULYSSES=As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree
Dialogue:ULYSSES=On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears
Dialogue:ULYSSES=To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=That matter needless, of importless burden,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Divide thy lips, than we are confident,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=We shall hear music, wit and oracle.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=But for these instances.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The specialty of rule hath been neglected:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=When that the general is not like the hive
Dialogue:ULYSSES=To whom the foragers shall all repair,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Observe degree, priority and place,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Office and custom, in all line of order;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
Dialogue:ULYSSES=In noble eminence enthroned and sphered
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And posts, like the commandment of a king,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets
Dialogue:ULYSSES=In evil mixture to disorder wander,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!
Dialogue:ULYSSES=What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Divert and crack, rend and deracinate
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The unity and married calm of states
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Which is the ladder to all high designs,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The primogenitive and due of birth,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=But by degree, stand in authentic place?
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Take but degree away, untune that string,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets
Dialogue:ULYSSES=In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And make a sop of all this solid globe:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Strength should be lord of imbecility,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And the rude son should strike his father dead:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Between whose endless jar justice resides,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Then every thing includes itself in power,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Power into will, will into appetite;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And appetite, an universal wolf,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=So doubly seconded with will and power,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Must make perforce an universal prey,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Follows the choking.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And this neglection of degree it is
Dialogue:ULYSSES=That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose
Dialogue:ULYSSES=It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd
Dialogue:ULYSSES=By him one step below, he by the next,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=That next by him beneath; so every step,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Exampled by the first pace that is sick
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Of pale and bloodless emulation:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
Dialogue:NESTOR=Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
Dialogue:NESTOR=The fever whereof all our power is sick.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=What is the remedy?
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The sinew and the forehand of our host,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Having his ear full of his airy fame,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Breaks scurril jests;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And with ridiculous and awkward action,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Thy topless deputation he puts on,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And, like a strutting player, whose conceit
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
Dialogue:ULYSSES=To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
Dialogue:ULYSSES='Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
Dialogue:ULYSSES=He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,
Dialogue:ULYSSES='Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=As he being drest to some oration.'
Dialogue:ULYSSES=That's done, as near as the extremest ends
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!
Dialogue:ULYSSES='Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Arming to answer in a night alarm.'
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
Dialogue:ULYSSES=In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Severals and generals of grace exact,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
Dialogue:ULYSSES=As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.
Dialogue:NESTOR=And in the imitation of these twain--
Dialogue:NESTOR=Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
Dialogue:NESTOR=With an imperial voice--many are infect.
Dialogue:NESTOR=Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head
Dialogue:NESTOR=In such a rein, in full as proud a place
Dialogue:NESTOR=As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;
Dialogue:NESTOR=Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,
Dialogue:NESTOR=A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
Dialogue:NESTOR=To match us in comparisons with dirt,
Dialogue:NESTOR=To weaken and discredit our exposure,
Dialogue:NESTOR=How rank soever rounded in with danger.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Count wisdom as no member of the war,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
Dialogue:ULYSSES=But that of hand: the still and mental parts,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=That do contrive how many hands shall strike,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=When fitness calls them on, and know by measure
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,--
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=So that the ram that batters down the wall,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=They place before his hand that made the engine,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Or those that with the fineness of their souls
Dialogue:ULYSSES=By reason guide his execution.
Dialogue:NESTOR=Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
Dialogue:NESTOR=Makes many Thetis' sons.
Notice:A tucket
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=What trumpet? look, Menelaus.
Dialogue:MENELAUS=From Troy.
Notice:Enter AENEAS
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=What would you 'fore our tent?
Dialogue:AENEAS=Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Even this.
Dialogue:AENEAS=May one, that is a herald and a prince,
Dialogue:AENEAS=Do a fair message to his kingly ears?
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON='Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Call Agamemnon head and general.
Dialogue:AENEAS=Fair leave and large security. How may
Dialogue:AENEAS=A stranger to those most imperial looks
Dialogue:AENEAS=Know them from eyes of other mortals?
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=How!
Dialogue:AENEAS=Ay;
Dialogue:AENEAS=I ask, that I might waken reverence,
Dialogue:AENEAS=And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
Dialogue:AENEAS=Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
Dialogue:AENEAS=The youthful Phoebus:
Dialogue:AENEAS=Which is that god in office, guiding men?
Dialogue:AENEAS=Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Are ceremonious courtiers.
Dialogue:AENEAS=Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,
Dialogue:AENEAS=As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:
Dialogue:AENEAS=But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
Dialogue:AENEAS=Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,
Dialogue:AENEAS=Jove's accord,
Dialogue:AENEAS=Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,
Dialogue:AENEAS=Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!
Dialogue:AENEAS=The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
Dialogue:AENEAS=If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:
Dialogue:AENEAS=But what the repining enemy commends,
Dialogue:AENEAS=That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,
Dialogue:AENEAS=transcends.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?
Dialogue:AENEAS=Ay, Greek, that is my name.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=What's your affair I pray you?
Dialogue:AENEAS=Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
Dialogue:AENEAS=Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:
Dialogue:AENEAS=I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
Dialogue:AENEAS=To set his sense on the attentive bent,
Dialogue:AENEAS=And then to speak.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=                  Speak frankly as the wind;
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=He tells thee so himself.
Dialogue:AENEAS=Trumpet, blow loud,
Dialogue:AENEAS=Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
Dialogue:AENEAS=And every Greek of mettle, let him know,
Dialogue:AENEAS=What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.
Notice:Trumpet sounds
Dialogue:AENEAS=We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy
Dialogue:AENEAS=A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--
Dialogue:AENEAS=Who in this dull and long-continued truce
Dialogue:AENEAS=Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,
Dialogue:AENEAS=And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!
Dialogue:AENEAS=If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
Dialogue:AENEAS=That holds his honour higher than his ease,
Dialogue:AENEAS=That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
Dialogue:AENEAS=That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,
Dialogue:AENEAS=That loves his mistress more than in confession,
Dialogue:AENEAS=With truant vows to her own lips he loves,
Dialogue:AENEAS=And dare avow her beauty and her worth
Dialogue:AENEAS=In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.
Dialogue:AENEAS=Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
Dialogue:AENEAS=Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,
Dialogue:AENEAS=He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,
Dialogue:AENEAS=Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,
Dialogue:AENEAS=And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
Dialogue:AENEAS=Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
Dialogue:AENEAS=To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:
Dialogue:AENEAS=If any come, Hector shall honour him;
Dialogue:AENEAS=If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,
Dialogue:AENEAS=The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
Dialogue:AENEAS=The splinter of a lance. Even so much.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=If none of them have soul in such a kind,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=That means not, hath not, or is not in love!
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.
Dialogue:NESTOR=Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man
Dialogue:NESTOR=When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;
Dialogue:NESTOR=But if there be not in our Grecian host
Dialogue:NESTOR=One noble man that hath one spark of fire,
Dialogue:NESTOR=To answer for his love, tell him from me
Dialogue:NESTOR=I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
Dialogue:NESTOR=And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
Dialogue:NESTOR=And meeting him will tell him that my lady
Dialogue:NESTOR=Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
Dialogue:NESTOR=As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
Dialogue:NESTOR=I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.
Dialogue:AENEAS=Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Amen.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Achilles shall have word of this intent;
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Yourself shall feast with us before you go
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=And find the welcome of a noble foe.
Notice:Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Nestor!
Dialogue:NESTOR=What says Ulysses?
Dialogue:ULYSSES=I have a young conception in my brain;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
Dialogue:NESTOR=What is't?
Dialogue:ULYSSES=This 'tis:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride
Dialogue:ULYSSES=That hath to this maturity blown up
Dialogue:ULYSSES=In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=To overbulk us all.
Dialogue:NESTOR=Well, and how?
Dialogue:ULYSSES=This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=However it is spread in general name,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Relates in purpose only to Achilles.
Dialogue:NESTOR=The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Whose grossness little characters sum up:
Dialogue:NESTOR=And, in the publication, make no strain,
Dialogue:NESTOR=But that Achilles, were his brain as barren
Dialogue:NESTOR=As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,
Dialogue:NESTOR='Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose
Dialogue:NESTOR=Pointing on him.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And wake him to the answer, think you?
Dialogue:NESTOR=Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,
Dialogue:NESTOR=That can from Hector bring his honour off,
Dialogue:NESTOR=If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;
Dialogue:NESTOR=For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
Dialogue:NESTOR=With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Our imputation shall be oddly poised
Dialogue:NESTOR=In this wild action; for the success,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Although particular, shall give a scantling
Dialogue:NESTOR=Of good or bad unto the general;
Dialogue:NESTOR=And in such indexes, although small pricks
Dialogue:NESTOR=To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
Dialogue:NESTOR=The baby figure of the giant mass
Dialogue:NESTOR=Of things to come at large. It is supposed
Dialogue:NESTOR=He that meets Hector issues from our choice
Dialogue:NESTOR=And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
Dialogue:NESTOR=As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd
Dialogue:NESTOR=Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,
Dialogue:NESTOR=What heart receives from hence the conquering part,
Dialogue:NESTOR=To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
Dialogue:NESTOR=Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,
Dialogue:NESTOR=In no less working than are swords and bows
Dialogue:NESTOR=Directive by the limbs.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Give pardon to my speech:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The lustre of the better yet to show,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Shall show the better. Do not consent
Dialogue:ULYSSES=That ever Hector and Achilles meet;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=For both our honour and our shame in this
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Are dogg'd with two strange followers.
Dialogue:NESTOR=I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?
Dialogue:ULYSSES=What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Were he not proud, we all should share with him:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=But he already is too insolent;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=A nd we were better parch in Afric sun
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Why then, we did our main opinion crush
Dialogue:ULYSSES=In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Give him allowance for the better man;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=For that will physic the great Myrmidon
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
Dialogue:ULYSSES=His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Yet go we under our opinion still
Dialogue:ULYSSES=That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.
Dialogue:NESTOR=Ulysses,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Now I begin to relish thy advice;
Dialogue:NESTOR=And I will give a taste of it forthwith
Dialogue:NESTOR=To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.
Dialogue:NESTOR=Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
Dialogue:NESTOR=Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.

Notice:Enter AJAX and THERSITES
Dialogue:AJAX=Thersites!
Dialogue:THERSITES=Agamemnon, how if he had boils? full, all over,
Dialogue:THERSITES=generally?
Dialogue:AJAX=Thersites!
Dialogue:THERSITES=And those boils did run? say so: did not the
Dialogue:THERSITES=general run then? were not that a botchy core?
Dialogue:AJAX=Dog!
Dialogue:THERSITES=Then would come some matter from him; I see none now.
Dialogue:AJAX=Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?
Notice:Beating him
Dialogue:AJAX=Feel, then.
Dialogue:THERSITES=The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel
Dialogue:THERSITES=beef-witted lord!
Dialogue:AJAX=Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will
Dialogue:AJAX=beat thee into handsomeness.
Dialogue:THERSITES=I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but,
Dialogue:THERSITES=I think, thy horse will sooner con an oration than
Dialogue:THERSITES=thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,
Dialogue:THERSITES=canst thou? a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks!
Dialogue:AJAX=Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.
Dialogue:THERSITES=Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?
Dialogue:AJAX=The proclamation!
Dialogue:THERSITES=Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.
Dialogue:AJAX=Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch.
Dialogue:THERSITES=I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had
Dialogue:THERSITES=the scratching of thee; I would make thee the
Dialogue:THERSITES=loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in
Dialogue:THERSITES=the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.
Dialogue:AJAX=I say, the proclamation!
Dialogue:THERSITES=Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles,
Dialogue:THERSITES=and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as
Dialogue:THERSITES=Cerberus is at Proserpine's beauty, ay, that thou
Dialogue:THERSITES=barkest at him.
Dialogue:AJAX=Mistress Thersites!
Dialogue:THERSITES=Thou shouldest strike him.
Dialogue:AJAX=Cobloaf!
Dialogue:THERSITES=He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a

Dialogue:THERSITES=Do, do.
Dialogue:AJAX=Thou stool for a witch!
Dialogue:THERSITES=Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast no
Dialogue:THERSITES=more brain than I have in mine elbows; an assinego
Dialogue:THERSITES=may tutor thee: thou scurvy-valiant ass! thou art
Dialogue:THERSITES=here but to thrash Trojans; and thou art bought and
Dialogue:THERSITES=sold among those of any wit, like a barbarian slave.
Dialogue:THERSITES=If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel, and
Dialogue:THERSITES=tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no
Dialogue:THERSITES=bowels, thou!
Dialogue:AJAX=You dog!
Dialogue:THERSITES=You scurvy lord!
Dialogue:AJAX=[Beating him]  You cur!
Dialogue:THERSITES=Mars his idiot! do, rudeness; do, camel; do, do.
Notice:Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Why, how now, Ajax! wherefore do you thus? How now,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Thersites! what's the matter, man?
Dialogue:THERSITES=You see him there, do you?
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Ay; what's the matter?
Dialogue:THERSITES=Nay, look upon him.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=So I do: what's the matter?
Dialogue:THERSITES=Nay, but regard him well.
Dialogue:ACHILLES='Well!' why, I do so.
Dialogue:THERSITES=But yet you look not well upon him; for whosoever you
Dialogue:THERSITES=take him to be, he is Ajax.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=I know that, fool.
Dialogue:THERSITES=Ay, but that fool knows not himself.
Dialogue:AJAX=Therefore I beat thee.
Dialogue:THERSITES=Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! his
Dialogue:THERSITES=evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his
Dialogue:THERSITES=brain more than he has beat my bones: I will buy
Dialogue:THERSITES=nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not
Dialogue:THERSITES=worth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord,
Dialogue:THERSITES=Achilles, Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly and
Dialogue:THERSITES=his guts in his head, I'll tell you what I say of
Dialogue:THERSITES=him.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=What?
Dialogue:THERSITES=I say, this Ajax--
Notice:Ajax offers to beat him
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Nay, good Ajax.
Dialogue:THERSITES=Has not so much wit--
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Nay, I must hold you.
Dialogue:THERSITES=As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he
Dialogue:THERSITES=comes to fight.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Peace, fool!
Dialogue:THERSITES=I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will
Dialogue:THERSITES=not: he there: that he: look you there.
Dialogue:AJAX=O thou damned cur! I shall--
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Will you set your wit to a fool's?
Dialogue:THERSITES=No, I warrant you; for a fools will shame it.
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Good words, Thersites.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=What's the quarrel?
Dialogue:AJAX=I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the
Dialogue:AJAX=proclamation, and he rails upon me.
Dialogue:THERSITES=I serve thee not.
Dialogue:AJAX=Well, go to, go to.
Dialogue:THERSITES=I serve here voluntarily.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Your last service was sufferance, 'twas not
Dialogue:ACHILLES=voluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was
Dialogue:ACHILLES=here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.
Dialogue:THERSITES=E'en so; a great deal of your wit, too, lies in your
Dialogue:THERSITES=sinews, or else there be liars. Hector have a great
Dialogue:THERSITES=catch, if he knock out either of your brains: a'
Dialogue:THERSITES=were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=What, with me too, Thersites?
Dialogue:THERSITES=There's Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was mouldy
Dialogue:THERSITES=ere your grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke you
Dialogue:THERSITES=like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=What, what?
Dialogue:THERSITES=Yes, good sooth: to, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!
Dialogue:AJAX=I shall cut out your tongue.
Dialogue:THERSITES='Tis no matter! I shall speak as much as thou
Dialogue:THERSITES=afterwards.
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=No more words, Thersites; peace!
Dialogue:THERSITES=I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall I?
Dialogue:ACHILLES=There's for you, Patroclus.
Dialogue:THERSITES=I will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I come
Dialogue:THERSITES=any more to your tents: I will keep where there is
Dialogue:THERSITES=wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=A good riddance.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host:
Dialogue:ACHILLES=That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy
Dialogue:ACHILLES=To-morrow morning call some knight to arms
Dialogue:ACHILLES=That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.
Dialogue:AJAX=Farewell. Who shall answer him?
Dialogue:ACHILLES=I know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwise
Dialogue:ACHILLES=He knew his man.
Dialogue:AJAX=O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.

Notice:Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUS
Dialogue:PRIAM=After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,
Dialogue:PRIAM=Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
Dialogue:PRIAM='Deliver Helen, and all damage else--
Dialogue:PRIAM=As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,
Dialogue:PRIAM=Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed
Dialogue:PRIAM=In hot digestion of this cormorant war--
Dialogue:PRIAM=Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?
Dialogue:HECTOR=Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
Dialogue:HECTOR=As far as toucheth my particular,
Dialogue:HECTOR=Yet, dread Priam,
Dialogue:HECTOR=There is no lady of more softer bowels,
Dialogue:HECTOR=More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
Dialogue:HECTOR=More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
Dialogue:HECTOR=Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,
Dialogue:HECTOR=Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd
Dialogue:HECTOR=The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
Dialogue:HECTOR=To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:
Dialogue:HECTOR=Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
Dialogue:HECTOR=Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,
Dialogue:HECTOR=Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:
Dialogue:HECTOR=If we have lost so many tenths of ours,
Dialogue:HECTOR=To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,
Dialogue:HECTOR=Had it our name, the value of one ten,
Dialogue:HECTOR=What merit's in that reason which denies
Dialogue:HECTOR=The yielding of her up?
Dialogue:TROILUS=Fie, fie, my brother!
Dialogue:TROILUS=Weigh you the worth and honour of a king
Dialogue:TROILUS=So great as our dread father in a scale
Dialogue:TROILUS=Of common ounces? will you with counters sum
Dialogue:TROILUS=The past proportion of his infinite?
Dialogue:TROILUS=And buckle in a waist most fathomless
Dialogue:TROILUS=With spans and inches so diminutive
Dialogue:TROILUS=As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!
Dialogue:HELENUS=No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,
Dialogue:HELENUS=You are so empty of them. Should not our father
Dialogue:HELENUS=Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,
Dialogue:HELENUS=Because your speech hath none that tells him so?
Dialogue:TROILUS=You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;
Dialogue:TROILUS=You fur your gloves with reason. Here are
Dialogue:TROILUS=your reasons:
Dialogue:TROILUS=You know an enemy intends you harm;
Dialogue:TROILUS=You know a sword employ'd is perilous,
Dialogue:TROILUS=And reason flies the object of all harm:
Dialogue:TROILUS=Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds
Dialogue:TROILUS=A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
Dialogue:TROILUS=The very wings of reason to his heels
Dialogue:TROILUS=And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour
Dialogue:TROILUS=Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat
Dialogue:TROILUS=their thoughts
Dialogue:TROILUS=With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect
Dialogue:TROILUS=Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
Dialogue:HECTOR=Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
Dialogue:HECTOR=The holding.
Dialogue:TROILUS=                  What is aught, but as 'tis valued?
Dialogue:HECTOR=But value dwells not in particular will;
Dialogue:HECTOR=It holds his estimate and dignity
Dialogue:HECTOR=As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
Dialogue:HECTOR=As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry
Dialogue:HECTOR=To make the service greater than the god
Dialogue:HECTOR=And the will dotes that is attributive
Dialogue:HECTOR=To what infectiously itself affects,
Dialogue:HECTOR=Without some image of the affected merit.
Dialogue:TROILUS=I take to-day a wife, and my election
Dialogue:TROILUS=Is led on in the conduct of my will;
Dialogue:TROILUS=My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores
Dialogue:TROILUS=Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Although my will distaste what it elected,
Dialogue:TROILUS=The wife I chose? there can be no evasion
Dialogue:TROILUS=To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:
Dialogue:TROILUS=We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,
Dialogue:TROILUS=When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands
Dialogue:TROILUS=We do not throw in unrespective sieve,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Because we now are full. It was thought meet
Dialogue:TROILUS=Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
Dialogue:TROILUS=Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
Dialogue:TROILUS=The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce
Dialogue:TROILUS=And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,
Dialogue:TROILUS=And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,
Dialogue:TROILUS=He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
Dialogue:TROILUS=Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:
Dialogue:TROILUS=Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,
Dialogue:TROILUS=And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
Dialogue:TROILUS=If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--
Dialogue:TROILUS=As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--
Dialogue:TROILUS=If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--
Dialogue:TROILUS=As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands
Dialogue:TROILUS=And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now
Dialogue:TROILUS=The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,
Dialogue:TROILUS=And do a deed that fortune never did,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Beggar the estimation which you prized
Dialogue:TROILUS=Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
Dialogue:TROILUS=That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!
Dialogue:TROILUS=But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,
Dialogue:TROILUS=That in their country did them that disgrace,
Dialogue:TROILUS=We fear to warrant in our native place!
Dialogue:CASSANDRA=[Within]  Cry, Trojans, cry!
Dialogue:PRIAM=What noise? what shriek is this?
Dialogue:TROILUS='Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.
Dialogue:CASSANDRA=[Within]  Cry, Trojans!
Dialogue:HECTOR=It is Cassandra.
Notice:Enter CASSANDRA, raving

Dialogue:CASSANDRA=Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,
Dialogue:CASSANDRA=Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes
Dialogue:CASSANDRA=A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
Dialogue:CASSANDRA=Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!
Dialogue:CASSANDRA=Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;
Dialogue:CASSANDRA=Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.
Dialogue:CASSANDRA=Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:
Dialogue:CASSANDRA=Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:HECTOR=Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
Dialogue:HECTOR=Of divination in our sister work
Dialogue:HECTOR=Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
Dialogue:HECTOR=So madly hot that no discourse of reason,
Dialogue:HECTOR=Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
Dialogue:HECTOR=Can qualify the same?
Dialogue:TROILUS=Why, brother Hector,
Dialogue:TROILUS=We may not think the justness of each act
Dialogue:TROILUS=Such and no other than event doth form it,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Nor once deject the courage of our minds,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures
Dialogue:TROILUS=Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
Dialogue:TROILUS=Which hath our several honours all engaged
Dialogue:TROILUS=To make it gracious. For my private part,
Dialogue:TROILUS=I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:
Dialogue:TROILUS=And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
Dialogue:TROILUS=Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
Dialogue:TROILUS=To fight for and maintain!
Dialogue:PARIS=Else might the world convince of levity
Dialogue:PARIS=As well my undertakings as your counsels:
Dialogue:PARIS=But I attest the gods, your full consent
Dialogue:PARIS=Gave wings to my propension and cut off
Dialogue:PARIS=All fears attending on so dire a project.
Dialogue:PARIS=For what, alas, can these my single arms?
Dialogue:PARIS=What Propugnation is in one man's valour,
Dialogue:PARIS=To stand the push and enmity of those
Dialogue:PARIS=This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,
Dialogue:PARIS=Were I alone to pass the difficulties
Dialogue:PARIS=And had as ample power as I have will,
Dialogue:PARIS=Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,
Dialogue:PARIS=Nor faint in the pursuit.
Dialogue:PRIAM=Paris, you speak
Dialogue:PRIAM=Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
Dialogue:PRIAM=You have the honey still, but these the gall;
Dialogue:PRIAM=So to be valiant is no praise at all.
Dialogue:PARIS=Sir, I propose not merely to myself
Dialogue:PARIS=The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;
Dialogue:PARIS=But I would have the soil of her fair rape
Dialogue:PARIS=Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.
Dialogue:PARIS=What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,
Dialogue:PARIS=Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,
Dialogue:PARIS=Now to deliver her possession up
Dialogue:PARIS=On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
Dialogue:PARIS=That so degenerate a strain as this
Dialogue:PARIS=Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
Dialogue:PARIS=There's not the meanest spirit on our party
Dialogue:PARIS=Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
Dialogue:PARIS=When Helen is defended, nor none so noble
Dialogue:PARIS=Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
Dialogue:PARIS=Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,
Dialogue:PARIS=Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,
Dialogue:PARIS=The world's large spaces cannot parallel.
Dialogue:HECTOR=Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
Dialogue:HECTOR=And on the cause and question now in hand
Dialogue:HECTOR=Have glozed, but superficially: not much
Dialogue:HECTOR=Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
Dialogue:HECTOR=Unfit to hear moral philosophy:
Dialogue:HECTOR=The reasons you allege do more conduce
Dialogue:HECTOR=To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
Dialogue:HECTOR=Than to make up a free determination
Dialogue:HECTOR='Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge
Dialogue:HECTOR=Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
Dialogue:HECTOR=Of any true decision. Nature craves
Dialogue:HECTOR=All dues be render'd to their owners: now,
Dialogue:HECTOR=What nearer debt in all humanity
Dialogue:HECTOR=Than wife is to the husband? If this law
Dialogue:HECTOR=Of nature be corrupted through affection,
Dialogue:HECTOR=And that great minds, of partial indulgence
Dialogue:HECTOR=To their benumbed wills, resist the same,
Dialogue:HECTOR=There is a law in each well-order'd nation
Dialogue:HECTOR=To curb those raging appetites that are
Dialogue:HECTOR=Most disobedient and refractory.
Dialogue:HECTOR=If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,
Dialogue:HECTOR=As it is known she is, these moral laws
Dialogue:HECTOR=Of nature and of nations speak aloud
Dialogue:HECTOR=To have her back return'd: thus to persist
Dialogue:HECTOR=In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
Dialogue:HECTOR=But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
Dialogue:HECTOR=Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,
Dialogue:HECTOR=My spritely brethren, I propend to you
Dialogue:HECTOR=In resolution to keep Helen still,
Dialogue:HECTOR=For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
Dialogue:HECTOR=Upon our joint and several dignities.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:
Dialogue:TROILUS=Were it not glory that we more affected
Dialogue:TROILUS=Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
Dialogue:TROILUS=I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
Dialogue:TROILUS=Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,
Dialogue:TROILUS=She is a theme of honour and renown,
Dialogue:TROILUS=A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
Dialogue:TROILUS=Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
Dialogue:TROILUS=And fame in time to come canonize us;
Dialogue:TROILUS=For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose
Dialogue:TROILUS=So rich advantage of a promised glory
Dialogue:TROILUS=As smiles upon the forehead of this action
Dialogue:TROILUS=For the wide world's revenue.
Dialogue:HECTOR=I am yours,
Dialogue:HECTOR=You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
Dialogue:HECTOR=I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
Dialogue:HECTOR=The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks
Dialogue:HECTOR=Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:
Dialogue:HECTOR=I was advertised their great general slept,

Dialogue:THERSITES=would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,
Dialogue:THERSITES=whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to
Dialogue:THERSITES=conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of

Dialogue:THERSITES=rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two
Dialogue:THERSITES=undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of

Dialogue:THERSITES=short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
Dialogue:THERSITES=scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly

Dialogue:THERSITES=whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,

Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Thou mayst tell that knowest.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=O, tell, tell.
Dialogue:THERSITES=I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands

Dialogue:ACHILLES=He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.
Dialogue:THERSITES=Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites
Dialogue:THERSITES=is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Derive this; come.
Dialogue:THERSITES=Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;
Dialogue:THERSITES=Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;
Dialogue:THERSITES=Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and
Dialogue:THERSITES=Patroclus is a fool positive.
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Why am I a fool?

Dialogue:NESTOR=Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=No, you see, he is his argument that has his
Dialogue:ULYSSES=argument, Achilles.
Dialogue:NESTOR=All the better; their fraction is more our wish than
Dialogue:NESTOR=their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool
Dialogue:NESTOR=could disunite.

Dialogue:AJAX=Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I
Dialogue:AJAX=know not what pride is.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the

Dialogue:TROILUS=As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,

Dialogue:TROILUS=Yet, after all comparisons of truth,

Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Prophet may you be!
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=When time is old and hath forgot itself,
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=And mighty states characterless are grated
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=To dusty nothing, yet let memory,
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=From false to false, among false maids in love,
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'

Dialogue:CRESSIDA='As false as Cressid.'

Dialogue:TROILUS=Amen.
Dialogue:CRESSIDA=Amen.

Dialogue:PANDARUS=And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here
Dialogue:PANDARUS=Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!

Notice:Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX, MENELAUS, and CALCHAS
Dialogue:CALCHAS=Now, princes, for the service I have done you,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
Dialogue:CALCHAS=To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
Dialogue:CALCHAS=That, through the sight I bear in things to love,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=From certain and possess'd conveniences,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all
Dialogue:CALCHAS=That time, acquaintance, custom and condition
Dialogue:CALCHAS=Made tame and most familiar to my nature,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=And here, to do you service, am become
Dialogue:CALCHAS=As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:
Dialogue:CALCHAS=I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=To give me now a little benefit,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=Out of those many register'd in promise,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.
Dialogue:CALCHAS=You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
Dialogue:CALCHAS=Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
Dialogue:CALCHAS=Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
Dialogue:CALCHAS=That their negotiations all must slack,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=Wanting his manage; and they will almost
Dialogue:CALCHAS=Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
Dialogue:CALCHAS=Shall quite strike off all service I have done,
Dialogue:CALCHAS=In most accepted pain.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Let Diomedes bear him,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=Which I am proud to bear.
Notice:Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS
Notice:Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Please it our general to pass strangely by him,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=As if he were forgot; and, princes all,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=If so, I have derision medicinable,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=To use between your strangeness and his pride,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Which his own will shall have desire to drink:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=It may be good: pride hath no other glass
Dialogue:ULYSSES=To show itself but pride, for supple knees
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=We'll execute your purpose, and put on
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=A form of strangeness as we pass along:
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=So do each lord, and either greet him not,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=What, comes the general to speak with me?
Dialogue:ACHILLES=You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=What says Achilles? would he aught with us?
Dialogue:NESTOR=Would you, my lord, aught with the general?
Dialogue:ACHILLES=No.
Dialogue:NESTOR=Nothing, my lord.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=The better.

Dialogue:ACHILLES=What, does the cuckold scorn me?
Dialogue:AJAX=How now, Patroclus!
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Good morrow, Ajax.
Dialogue:AJAX=Ha?
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Good morrow.
Dialogue:AJAX=Ay, and good next day too.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:ACHILLES=What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=They pass by strangely: they were used to bend
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=To send their smiles before them to Achilles;
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=To come as humbly as they used to creep
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=To holy altars.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=                  What, am I poor of late?
Dialogue:ACHILLES='Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
Dialogue:ACHILLES=He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
Dialogue:ACHILLES=As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=And not a man, for being simply man,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Hath any honour, but honour for those honours
Dialogue:ACHILLES=That are without him, as place, riches, favour,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Do one pluck down another and together
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
Dialogue:ACHILLES=At ample point all that I did possess,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Something not worth in me such rich beholding
Dialogue:ACHILLES=As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;
Dialogue:ACHILLES=I'll interrupt his reading.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=How now Ulysses!
Dialogue:ULYSSES=                  Now, great Thetis' son!
Dialogue:ACHILLES=What are you reading?
Dialogue:ULYSSES=A strange fellow here
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=How much in having, or without or in,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=As when his virtues shining upon others
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Heat them and they retort that heat again
Dialogue:ULYSSES=To the first giver.'
Dialogue:ACHILLES=This is not strange, Ulysses.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=The beauty that is borne here in the face
Dialogue:ACHILLES=The bearer knows not, but commends itself
Dialogue:ACHILLES=To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Salutes each other with each other's form;
Dialogue:ACHILLES=For speculation turns not to itself,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=I do not strain at the position,--
Dialogue:ULYSSES=It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves
Dialogue:ULYSSES=That no man is the lord of any thing,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Though in and of him there be much consisting,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Till he communicate his parts to others:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Till he behold them form'd in the applause
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Where they're extended; who, like an arch,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=reverberates
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The voice again, or, like a gate of steel
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
Dialogue:ULYSSES=His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And apprehended here immediately
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The unknown Ajax.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Most abject in regard and dear in use!
Dialogue:ULYSSES=What things again most dear in the esteem
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--
Dialogue:ULYSSES=An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=While some men leave to do!
Dialogue:ULYSSES=How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
Dialogue:ULYSSES=How one man eats into another's pride,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
Dialogue:ULYSSES=To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already
Dialogue:ULYSSES=They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And great Troy shrieking.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=I do believe it; for they pass'd by me
Dialogue:ACHILLES=As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd
Dialogue:ULYSSES=As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
Dialogue:ULYSSES=As done: perseverance, dear my lord,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
Dialogue:ULYSSES=In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=For honour travels in a strait so narrow,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=For emulation hath a thousand sons
Dialogue:ULYSSES=That one by one pursue: if you give way,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And leave you hindmost;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=For time is like a fashionable host
Dialogue:ULYSSES=That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not
Dialogue:ULYSSES=virtue seek
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Remuneration for the thing it was;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=For beauty, wit,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
Dialogue:ULYSSES=To envious and calumniating time.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Though they are made and moulded of things past,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And give to dust that is a little gilt
Dialogue:ULYSSES=More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The present eye praises the present object.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And still it might, and yet it may again,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And case thy reputation in thy tent;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And drave great Mars to faction.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Of this my privacy
Dialogue:ACHILLES=I have strong reasons.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=But 'gainst your privacy
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The reasons are more potent and heroical:
Dialogue:ULYSSES='Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
Dialogue:ULYSSES=With one of Priam's daughters.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Ha! known!
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Is that a wonder?
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The providence that's in a watchful state
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=There is a mystery--with whom relation
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Which hath an operation more divine
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Than breath or pen can give expressure to:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=All the commerce that you have had with Troy
Dialogue:ULYSSES=As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And better would it fit Achilles much
Dialogue:ULYSSES=To throw down Hector than Polyxena:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,
Dialogue:ULYSSES='Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=A woman impudent and mannish grown
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=They think my little stomach to the war
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=And your great love to me restrains you thus:
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Be shook to air.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=                  Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=I see my reputation is at stake
Dialogue:ACHILLES=My fame is shrewdly gored.
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=O, then, beware;
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Omission to do what is necessary
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Even then when we sit idly in the sun.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:
Dialogue:ACHILLES=I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
Dialogue:ACHILLES=To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
Dialogue:ACHILLES=To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=An appetite that I am sick withal,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=To talk with him and to behold his visage,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Even to my full of view.
Notice:Enter THERSITES
Dialogue:ACHILLES=A labour saved!
Dialogue:THERSITES=A wonder!
Dialogue:ACHILLES=What?
Dialogue:THERSITES=Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=How so?
Dialogue:THERSITES=He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so
Dialogue:THERSITES=prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
Dialogue:THERSITES=raves in saying nothing.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=How can that be?
Dialogue:THERSITES=Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride
Dialogue:THERSITES=and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
Dialogue:THERSITES=arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:
Dialogue:THERSITES=bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should
Dialogue:THERSITES=say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'
Dialogue:THERSITES=and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire
Dialogue:THERSITES=in a flint, which will not show without knocking.
Dialogue:THERSITES=The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his
Dialogue:THERSITES=neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in
Dialogue:THERSITES=vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,
Dialogue:THERSITES=Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think
Dialogue:THERSITES=you of this man that takes me for the general? He's
Dialogue:THERSITES=grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.
Dialogue:THERSITES=A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both
Dialogue:THERSITES=sides, like a leather jerkin.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.
Dialogue:THERSITES=Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not
Dialogue:THERSITES=answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his
Dialogue:THERSITES=tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let
Dialogue:THERSITES=Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the
Dialogue:THERSITES=pageant of Ajax.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the
Dialogue:ACHILLES=valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
Dialogue:ACHILLES=to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure
Dialogue:ACHILLES=safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous
Dialogue:ACHILLES=and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured
Dialogue:ACHILLES=captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=et cetera. Do this.
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Jove bless great Ajax!
Dialogue:THERSITES=Hum!
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=I come from the worthy Achilles,--
Dialogue:THERSITES=Ha!
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--
Dialogue:THERSITES=Hum!
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.
Dialogue:THERSITES=Agamemnon!
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Ay, my lord.
Dialogue:THERSITES=Ha!
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=What say you to't?
Dialogue:THERSITES=God b' wi' you, with all my heart.
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Your answer, sir.
Dialogue:THERSITES=If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it will
Dialogue:THERSITES=go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me
Dialogue:THERSITES=ere he has me.
Dialogue:PATROCLUS=Your answer, sir.
Dialogue:THERSITES=Fare you well, with all my heart.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?
Dialogue:THERSITES=No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in
Dialogue:THERSITES=him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know
Dialogue:THERSITES=not; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo
Dialogue:THERSITES=get his sinews to make catlings on.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.
Dialogue:THERSITES=Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the more
Dialogue:THERSITES=capable creature.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;
Dialogue:ACHILLES=And I myself see not the bottom of it.
Notice:Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
Dialogue:THERSITES=Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,
Dialogue:THERSITES=that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a
Dialogue:THERSITES=tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.

Dialogue:AENEAS=Had I so good occasion to lie long
Dialogue:AENEAS=As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business
Dialogue:AENEAS=Should rob my bed-mate of my company.
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.
Dialogue:PARIS=A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--
Dialogue:PARIS=Witness the process of your speech, wherein
Dialogue:PARIS=You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
Dialogue:PARIS=Did haunt you in the field.
Dialogue:AENEAS=Health to you, valiant sir,
Dialogue:AENEAS=During all question of the gentle truce;
Dialogue:AENEAS=But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance
Dialogue:AENEAS=As heart can think or courage execute.
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=The one and other Diomed embraces.
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=But when contention and occasion meet,
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=With all my force, pursuit and policy.
Dialogue:AENEAS=And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly
Dialogue:AENEAS=With his face backward. In humane gentleness,
Dialogue:AENEAS=Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,
Dialogue:AENEAS=Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,
Dialogue:AENEAS=No man alive can love in such a sort
Dialogue:AENEAS=The thing he means to kill more excellently.
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=A thousand complete courses of the sun!
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!
Dialogue:AENEAS=We know each other well.
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=We do; and long to know each other worse.
Dialogue:PARIS=This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,
Dialogue:PARIS=The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.
Dialogue:PARIS=What business, lord, so early?
Dialogue:AENEAS=I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.
Dialogue:PARIS=His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
Dialogue:PARIS=To Calchas' house, and there to render him,
Dialogue:PARIS=For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:
Dialogue:PARIS=Let's have your company, or, if you please,
Dialogue:PARIS=Haste there before us: I constantly do think--
Dialogue:PARIS=Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--
Dialogue:PARIS=My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
Dialogue:PARIS=Rouse him and give him note of our approach.
Dialogue:PARIS=With the whole quality wherefore: I fear
Dialogue:PARIS=We shall be much unwelcome.
Dialogue:AENEAS=That I assure you:
Dialogue:AENEAS=Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
Dialogue:AENEAS=Than Cressid borne from Troy.

Dialogue:DIOMEDES=Not making any scruple of her soilure,
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=With such a hell of pain and world of charge,
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=And you as well to keep her, that defend her,
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=Not palating the taste of her dishonour,
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:

Dialogue:DIOMEDES=The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=But he as he, the heavier for a whore.
Dialogue:PARIS=You are too bitter to your countrywoman.
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=For every false drop in her bawdy veins
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=Of her contaminated carrion weight,

Dialogue:HECTOR=Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:
Dialogue:HECTOR=By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;
Dialogue:HECTOR=Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
Dialogue:HECTOR=Cousin, all honour to thee!
Dialogue:AJAX=I thank thee, Hector
Dialogue:AJAX=Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
Dialogue:AJAX=I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
Dialogue:AJAX=A great addition earned in thy death.
Dialogue:HECTOR=Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
Dialogue:HECTOR=On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
Dialogue:HECTOR=Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself
Dialogue:HECTOR=A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
Dialogue:AENEAS=There is expectance here from both the sides,
Dialogue:AENEAS=What further you will do.
Dialogue:HECTOR=We'll answer it;
Dialogue:HECTOR=The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.
Dialogue:AJAX=If I might in entreaties find success--
Dialogue:AJAX=As seld I have the chance--I would desire
Dialogue:AJAX=My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
Dialogue:DIOMEDES='Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles
Dialogue:DIOMEDES=Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
Dialogue:HECTOR=AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
Dialogue:HECTOR=And signify this loving interview
Dialogue:HECTOR=To the expecters of our Trojan part;
Dialogue:HECTOR=Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;
Dialogue:HECTOR=I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
Dialogue:AJAX=Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
Dialogue:HECTOR=The worthiest of them tell me name by name;
Dialogue:HECTOR=But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes
Dialogue:HECTOR=Shall find him by his large and portly size.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=That would be rid of such an enemy;
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=But that's no welcome: understand more clear,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=And formless ruin of oblivion;
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Bids thee, with most divine integrity,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.

Dialogue:HECTOR=Who must we answer?
Dialogue:AENEAS=The noble Menelaus.
Dialogue:HECTOR=O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
Dialogue:HECTOR=Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;
Dialogue:HECTOR=Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
Dialogue:HECTOR=She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.
Dialogue:MENELAUS=Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
Dialogue:HECTOR=O, pardon; I offend.
Dialogue:NESTOR=I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft
Dialogue:NESTOR=Labouring for destiny make cruel way
Dialogue:NESTOR=Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,
Dialogue:NESTOR=As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Despising many forfeits and subduements,
Dialogue:NESTOR=When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Not letting it decline on the declined,
Dialogue:NESTOR=That I have said to some my standers by
Dialogue:NESTOR='Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'
Dialogue:NESTOR=And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
Dialogue:NESTOR=When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;
Dialogue:NESTOR=But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,
Dialogue:NESTOR=I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,
Dialogue:NESTOR=And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;
Dialogue:NESTOR=But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,
Dialogue:NESTOR=Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;
Dialogue:NESTOR=And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.
Dialogue:AENEAS='Tis the old Nestor.
Dialogue:HECTOR=Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,
Dialogue:HECTOR=That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:
Dialogue:HECTOR=Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.
Dialogue:NESTOR=I would my arms could match thee in contention,
Dialogue:NESTOR=As they contend with thee in courtesy.
Dialogue:HECTOR=I would they could.
Dialogue:NESTOR=Ha!
Dialogue:NESTOR=By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.
Dialogue:NESTOR=Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=I wonder now how yonder city stands
Dialogue:ULYSSES=When we have here her base and pillar by us.
Dialogue:HECTOR=I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.
Dialogue:HECTOR=Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,
Dialogue:HECTOR=Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
Dialogue:HECTOR=In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=My prophecy is but half his journey yet;
Dialogue:ULYSSES=For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Must kiss their own feet.
Dialogue:HECTOR=I must not believe you:
Dialogue:HECTOR=There they stand yet, and modestly I think,
Dialogue:HECTOR=The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
Dialogue:HECTOR=A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,
Dialogue:HECTOR=And that old common arbitrator, Time,
Dialogue:HECTOR=Will one day end it.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=So to him we leave it.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:
Dialogue:ULYSSES=After the general, I beseech you next
Dialogue:ULYSSES=To feast with me and see me at my tent.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;
Dialogue:ACHILLES=I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=And quoted joint by joint.
Dialogue:HECTOR=Is this Achilles?
Dialogue:ACHILLES=I am Achilles.
Dialogue:HECTOR=Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Behold thy fill.
Dialogue:HECTOR=                  Nay, I have done already.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Thou art too brief: I will the second time,
Dialogue:ACHILLES=As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.
Dialogue:HECTOR=O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;
Dialogue:HECTOR=But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
Dialogue:HECTOR=Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?
Dialogue:ACHILLES=That I may give the local wound a name
Dialogue:ACHILLES=And make distinct the very breach whereout
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!
Dialogue:HECTOR=It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,
Dialogue:HECTOR=To answer such a question: stand again:
Dialogue:HECTOR=Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
Dialogue:HECTOR=As to prenominate in nice conjecture
Dialogue:HECTOR=Where thou wilt hit me dead?
Dialogue:ACHILLES=I tell thee, yea.
Dialogue:HECTOR=Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,
Dialogue:HECTOR=I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;
Dialogue:HECTOR=For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;
Dialogue:HECTOR=But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,
Dialogue:HECTOR=I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.
Dialogue:HECTOR=You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;
Dialogue:HECTOR=His insolence draws folly from my lips;
Dialogue:HECTOR=But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,
Dialogue:HECTOR=Or may I never--
Dialogue:AJAX=                  Do not chafe thee, cousin:
Dialogue:AJAX=And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
Dialogue:AJAX=Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
Dialogue:AJAX=You may have every day enough of Hector
Dialogue:AJAX=If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,
Dialogue:AJAX=Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
Dialogue:HECTOR=I pray you, let us see you in the field:
Dialogue:HECTOR=We have had pelting wars, since you refused
Dialogue:HECTOR=The Grecians' cause.
Dialogue:ACHILLES=Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
Dialogue:ACHILLES=To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;
Dialogue:ACHILLES=To-night all friends.
Dialogue:HECTOR=Thy hand upon that match.
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=There in the full convive we: afterwards,
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
Dialogue:AGAMEMNON=Concur together, severally entreat him.

Dialogue:ULYSSES=Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,
Dialogue:ULYSSES=But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
Dialogue:ULYSSES=On the fair Cressid.
Dialogue:TROILUS=Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,
Dialogue:TROILUS=After we part from Agamemnon's tent,
Dialogue:TROILUS=To bring me thither?
Dialogue:ULYSSES=You shall command me, sir.
Dialogue:ULYSSES=As gentle tell me, of what honour was
Dialogue:ULYSSES=This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
Dialogue:ULYSSES=That wails her absence?
Dialogue:TROILUS=O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars
Dialogue:TROILUS=A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
Dialogue:TROILUS=She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth:
