Dialogue#MARIA=Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest

Dialogue#MARIA=What's that to the purpose?
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
Dialogue#MARIA=Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:
Dialogue#MARIA=he's a very fool and a prodigal.
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the

Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=word for word without book, and hath all the good

Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
Dialogue#MARIA=My name is Mary, sir.
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=Good Mistress Mary Accost,--
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=her, woo her, assail her.
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=By my troth, I would not undertake her in this
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?
Dialogue#MARIA=Fare you well, gentlemen.
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=never draw sword again.
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=An you part so, mistress, I would I might never
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have

Dialogue#MARIA=It's dry, sir.
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?

Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=followed the arts!
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=Why, would that have mended my hair?
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I

Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=Taurus! That's sides and heart.

Dialogue#OLIVIA=Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Your will?
Dialogue#VIOLA=Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--I
Dialogue#VIOLA=pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
Dialogue#VIOLA=for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
Dialogue#VIOLA=my speech, for besides that it is excellently well
Dialogue#VIOLA=penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
Dialogue#VIOLA=beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
Dialogue#VIOLA=comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Whence came you, sir?
Dialogue#VIOLA=I can say little more than I have studied, and that
Dialogue#VIOLA=question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
Dialogue#VIOLA=modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,
Dialogue#VIOLA=that I may proceed in my speech.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Are you a comedian?
Dialogue#VIOLA=No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs
Dialogue#VIOLA=of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you
Dialogue#VIOLA=the lady of the house?
Dialogue#OLIVIA=If I do not usurp myself, I am.
Dialogue#VIOLA=Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
Dialogue#VIOLA=yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours
Dialogue#VIOLA=to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will
Dialogue#VIOLA=on with my speech in your praise, and then show you
Dialogue#VIOLA=the heart of my message.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.
Dialogue#VIOLA=Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,
Dialogue#OLIVIA=keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,
Dialogue#OLIVIA=and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
Dialogue#OLIVIA=than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if
Dialogue#OLIVIA=you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of
Dialogue#OLIVIA=moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
Dialogue#MARIA=Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.
Dialogue#VIOLA=No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little
Dialogue#VIOLA=longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet
Dialogue#VIOLA=lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when
Dialogue#OLIVIA=the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
Dialogue#VIOLA=It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
Dialogue#VIOLA=war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my
Dialogue#VIOLA=hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?
Dialogue#VIOLA=The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
Dialogue#VIOLA=learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
Dialogue#VIOLA=would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,

Dialogue#OLIVIA=Where lies your text?
Dialogue#VIOLA=In Orsino's bosom.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
Dialogue#VIOLA=To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
Dialogue#VIOLA=Good madam, let me see your face.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
Dialogue#OLIVIA=with my face? You are now out of your text: but

Dialogue#VIOLA=And leave the world no copy.

Dialogue#OLIVIA=out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
Dialogue#OLIVIA=inventoried, and every particle and utensil
Dialogue#OLIVIA=labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,

Dialogue#VIOLA=The nonpareil of beauty!
Dialogue#OLIVIA=How does he love me?
Dialogue#VIOLA=With adorations, fertile tears,
Dialogue#VIOLA=With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:

Dialogue#OLIVIA=Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
Dialogue#OLIVIA=In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;
Dialogue#OLIVIA=And in dimension and the shape of nature
Dialogue#OLIVIA=A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
Dialogue#OLIVIA=He might have took his answer long ago.
Dialogue#VIOLA=If I did love you in my master's flame,
Dialogue#VIOLA=With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
Dialogue#VIOLA=In your denial I would find no sense;
Dialogue#VIOLA=I would not understand it.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Why, what would you?
Dialogue#VIOLA=Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
Dialogue#VIOLA=And call upon my soul within the house;
Dialogue#VIOLA=Write loyal cantons of contemned love
Dialogue#VIOLA=And sing them loud even in the dead of night;

Dialogue#VIOLA=And make the babbling gossip of the air
Dialogue#VIOLA=Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest
Dialogue#VIOLA=Between the elements of air and earth,

Dialogue#OLIVIA=I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
Dialogue#VIOLA=I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
Dialogue#VIOLA=My master, not myself, lacks recompense.

Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps

Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=me in manners the rather to express myself. You
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=which I called Roderigo. My father was that
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,

Dialogue#ANTONIO=Alas the day!
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=though I could not with such estimable wonder
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but

Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Than women's are.

Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Then let thy love be younger than thyself,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;

Dialogue#VIOLA=My father had a daughter loved a man,
Dialogue#VIOLA=As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
Dialogue#VIOLA=I should your lordship.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=And what's her history?
Dialogue#VIOLA=A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
Dialogue#VIOLA=But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
Dialogue#VIOLA=Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
Dialogue#VIOLA=And with a green and yellow melancholy
Dialogue#VIOLA=She sat like patience on a monument,
Dialogue#VIOLA=Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
Dialogue#VIOLA=We men may say more, swear more: but indeed
Dialogue#VIOLA=Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
Dialogue#VIOLA=Much in our vows, but little in our love.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=But died thy sister of her love, my boy?

Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the

Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=I saw't i' the orchard.
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=As plain as I see you now.
Dialogue#FABIAN=This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW='Slight, will you make an ass o' me?
Dialogue#FABIAN=I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of
Dialogue#FABIAN=judgment and reason.
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah

Dialogue#FABIAN=She did show favour to the youth in your sight only
Dialogue#FABIAN=to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to
Dialogue#FABIAN=put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
Dialogue#FABIAN=You should then have accosted her; and with some
Dialogue#FABIAN=excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should
Dialogue#FABIAN=have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
Dialogue#FABIAN=looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the
Dialogue#FABIAN=double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
Dialogue#FABIAN=off, and you are now sailed into the north of my
Dialogue#FABIAN=lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle
Dialogue#FABIAN=on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by
Dialogue#FABIAN=some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=An't be any way, it must be with valour; for policy
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=politician.
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no

Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=commendation with woman than report of valour.
Dialogue#FABIAN=There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?

Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be

Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=paper, although the sheet were big enough for the
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.

Dialogue#FABIAN=not deliver't?
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of

Dialogue#MARIA=murderer. He does obey every point of the letter
Dialogue#MARIA=that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his
Dialogue#MARIA=face into more lines than is in the new map with the
Dialogue#MARIA=augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such

Dialogue#ANTONIO=More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;

Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=With the memorials and the things of fame
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=That do renown this city.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Would you'ld pardon me;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I do not without danger walk these streets:

Dialogue#ANTONIO=I did some service; of such note indeed,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Belike you slew great number of his people.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=The offence is not of such a bloody nature;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Might well have given us bloody argument.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=It might have since been answer'd in repaying
Dialogue#ANTONIO=What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,

Dialogue#OLIVIA=Where is Malvolio?
Dialogue#MARIA=He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He
Dialogue#MARIA=is, sure, possessed, madam.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Why, what's the matter? does he rave?
Dialogue#MARIA=No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your

Dialogue#MALVOLIO=Sweet lady, ho, ho.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Smilest thou?
Dialogue#OLIVIA=I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=please all.'
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It

Notice#Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than

Dialogue#MALVOLIO=the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that

Dialogue#MALVOLIO=face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing

Dialogue#OLIVIA=What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--
Dialogue#VIOLA=My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
Dialogue#OLIVIA=It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
Dialogue#OLIVIA=As howling after music.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Still so cruel?
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Still so constant, lord.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=And that I partly know the instrument
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=That screws me from my true place in your favour,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=But this your minion, whom I know you love,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
Dialogue#VIOLA=And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,
Dialogue#VIOLA=To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Where goes Cesario?
Dialogue#VIOLA=After him I love
Dialogue#VIOLA=More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
Dialogue#VIOLA=More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.
Dialogue#VIOLA=If I do feign, you witnesses above
Dialogue#VIOLA=Punish my life for tainting of my love!
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!
Dialogue#VIOLA=Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Call forth the holy father.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Come, away!
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Husband!
Dialogue#OLIVIA=       Ay, husband: can he that deny?
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Her husband, sirrah!
Dialogue#VIOLA=No, my lord, not I.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear
Dialogue#OLIVIA=That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art
Dialogue#OLIVIA=As great as that thou fear'st.
Notice#Enter Priest
Dialogue#OLIVIA=O, welcome, father!
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,

Dialogue#OLIVIA=To keep in darkness what occasion now
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.
Dialogue#Priest=A contract of eternal bond of love,
Dialogue#Priest=Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,
Dialogue#Priest=Attested by the holy close of lips,
Dialogue#Priest=Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;
Dialogue#Priest=And all the ceremony of this compact
Dialogue#Priest=Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:
Dialogue#Priest=Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave
Dialogue#Priest=I have travell'd but two hours.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
Dialogue#VIOLA=My lord, I do protest--
Dialogue#OLIVIA=O, do not swear!
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
Notice#Enter SIR ANDREW
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=to Sir Toby.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=What's the matter?
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=My gentleman, Cesario?
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW='Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do't
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=by Sir Toby.
Dialogue#VIOLA=Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
Dialogue#VIOLA=You drew your sword upon me without cause;
Dialogue#VIOLA=But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
Notice#Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=but if he had not been in drink, he would have
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=tickled you othergates than he did.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=How now, gentleman! how is't with you?
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=on't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?
Dialogue#Clown=O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes
Dialogue#Clown=were set at eight i' the morning.
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=hate a drunken rogue.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?
Dialogue#SIR ANDREW=I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together.
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a
Dialogue#SIR TOBY BELCH=knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.
Notice#Exeunt Clown, FABIAN, SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW
Notice#Enter SEBASTIAN
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=But, had it been the brother of my blood,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=I must have done no less with wit and safety.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=I do perceive it hath offended you:
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=We made each other but so late ago.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=A natural perspective, that is and is not!
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Since I have lost thee!
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Sebastian are you?
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=                  Fear'st thou that, Antonio?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=How have you made division of yourself?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Most wonderful!
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Do I stand there? I never had a brother;
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Nor can there be that deity in my nature,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Of here and every where. I had a sister,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Of charity, what kin are you to me?
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=What countryman? what name? what parentage?
Dialogue#VIOLA=Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;
Dialogue#VIOLA=Such a Sebastian was my brother too,
Dialogue#VIOLA=So went he suited to his watery tomb:
Dialogue#VIOLA=If spirits can assume both form and suit
Dialogue#VIOLA=You come to fright us.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=A spirit I am indeed;
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=But am in that dimension grossly clad
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Which from the womb I did participate.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'
Dialogue#VIOLA=My father had a mole upon his brow.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=And so had mine.
Dialogue#VIOLA=And died that day when Viola from her birth
Dialogue#VIOLA=Had number'd thirteen years.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=O, that record is lively in my soul!
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=He finished indeed his mortal act
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=That day that made my sister thirteen years.
Dialogue#VIOLA=If nothing lets to make us happy both
Dialogue#VIOLA=But this my masculine usurp'd attire,
Dialogue#VIOLA=Do not embrace me till each circumstance
Dialogue#VIOLA=Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
Dialogue#VIOLA=That I am Viola: which to confirm,
Dialogue#VIOLA=I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
Dialogue#VIOLA=Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
Dialogue#VIOLA=I was preserved to serve this noble count.
Dialogue#VIOLA=All the occurrence of my fortune since
Dialogue#VIOLA=Hath been between this lady and this lord.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=[To OLIVIA]  So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=But nature to her bias drew in that.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=You would have been contracted to a maid;
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
Notice#To VIOLA
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
Dialogue#VIOLA=And all those sayings will I overswear;
Dialogue#VIOLA=And those swearings keep as true in soul
Dialogue#VIOLA=As doth that orbed continent the fire
Dialogue#VIOLA=That severs day from night.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Give me thy hand;
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
Dialogue#VIOLA=The captain that did bring me first on shore
Dialogue#VIOLA=Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
Dialogue#VIOLA=Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,
Dialogue#VIOLA=A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
Dialogue#OLIVIA=And yet, alas, now I remember me,
Dialogue#OLIVIA=They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
Notice#Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN
Dialogue#OLIVIA=A most extracting frenzy of mine own
Dialogue#OLIVIA=From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=How does he, sirrah?
Dialogue#Clown=Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as
Dialogue#Clown=well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
Dialogue#Clown=letter to you; I should have given't you to-day
Dialogue#Clown=morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,
Dialogue#Clown=so it skills not much when they are delivered.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Open't, and read it.
Dialogue#Clown=Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
Dialogue#Clown=the madman.
Notice#Reads
Dialogue#Clown='By the Lord, madam,'--
Dialogue#OLIVIA=How now! art thou mad?
Dialogue#Clown=No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship
Dialogue#Clown=will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
Dialogue#Clown=So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to
Dialogue#Clown=read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Read it you, sirrah.
Notice#To FABIAN
Dialogue#FABIAN=[Reads]  'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the
Dialogue#FABIAN=world shall know it: though you have put me into
Dialogue#FABIAN=darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
Dialogue#FABIAN=me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as
Dialogue#FABIAN=your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
Dialogue#FABIAN=me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt
Dialogue#FABIAN=not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.
Dialogue#FABIAN=Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
Dialogue#FABIAN=unthought of and speak out of my injury.
Dialogue#FABIAN=THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Did he write this?
Dialogue#Clown=Ay, madam.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=This savours not much of distraction.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.
Notice#Exit FABIAN
Dialogue#OLIVIA=My lord so please you, these things further

Dialogue#OLIVIA=Here at my house and at my proper cost.
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.
Notice#To VIOLA
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Your master quits you; and for your service done him,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=So much against the mettle of your sex,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=And since you call'd me master for so long,
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Here is my hand: you shall from this time be
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Your master's mistress.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=A sister! you are she.
Notice#Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO
Dialogue#DUKE ORSINO=Is this the madman?

Dialogue#OLIVIA=How now, Malvolio!
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=                  Madam, you have done me wrong,
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=Notorious wrong.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=                  Have I, Malvolio? no.
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=You must not now deny it is your hand:
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=You can say none of this: well, grant it then
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=To put on yellow stockings and to frown
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=And, acting this in an obedient hope,
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=And made the most notorious geck and gull
Dialogue#MALVOLIO=That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Though, I confess, much like the character
Dialogue#OLIVIA=But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=And now I do bethink me, it was she
Dialogue#OLIVIA=First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,
Dialogue#OLIVIA=And in such forms which here were presupposed
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:
Dialogue#OLIVIA=This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;
Dialogue#OLIVIA=But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Of thine own cause.
Dialogue#FABIAN=Good madam, hear me speak,
Dialogue#FABIAN=And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
Dialogue#FABIAN=Taint the condition of this present hour,
Dialogue#FABIAN=Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,
Dialogue#FABIAN=Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
Dialogue#FABIAN=Set this device against Malvolio here,
Dialogue#FABIAN=Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
Dialogue#FABIAN=We had conceived against him: Maria writ
Dialogue#FABIAN=The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;
Dialogue#FABIAN=In recompense whereof he hath married her.
Dialogue#FABIAN=How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,
Dialogue#FABIAN=May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;
Dialogue#FABIAN=If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
Dialogue#FABIAN=That have on both sides pass'd.
Dialogue#OLIVIA=Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
Dialogue#Clown=Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,
Dialogue#Clown=and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was
Dialogue#Clown=one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but
Dialogue#Clown=that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'
Dialogue#Clown=But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such
Dialogue#Clown=a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'
