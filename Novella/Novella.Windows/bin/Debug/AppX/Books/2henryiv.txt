Notice#Enter RUMOUR, painted full of tongues
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Open your ears; for which of you will stop
Dialogue#RUMOUR=The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?
Dialogue#RUMOUR=I, from the orient to the drooping west,
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold
Dialogue#RUMOUR=The acts commenced on this ball of earth:
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,
Dialogue#RUMOUR=The which in every language I pronounce,
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.
Dialogue#RUMOUR=I speak of peace, while covert enmity
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Under the smile of safety wounds the world:
Dialogue#RUMOUR=And who but Rumour, who but only I,
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Make fearful musters and prepared defence,
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,
Dialogue#RUMOUR=And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures
Dialogue#RUMOUR=And of so easy and so plain a stop
Dialogue#RUMOUR=That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
Dialogue#RUMOUR=The still-discordant wavering multitude,
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Can play upon it. But what need I thus
Dialogue#RUMOUR=My well-known body to anatomize
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Among my household? Why is Rumour here?
Dialogue#RUMOUR=I run before King Harry's victory;
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Even with the rebel's blood. But what mean I
Dialogue#RUMOUR=To speak so true at first? my office is
Dialogue#RUMOUR=To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
Dialogue#RUMOUR=And that the king before the Douglas' rage
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
Dialogue#RUMOUR=This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
Dialogue#RUMOUR=And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,
Dialogue#RUMOUR=And not a man of them brings other news
Dialogue#RUMOUR=Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues
Dialogue#RUMOUR=They bring smooth comforts false, worse than
Dialogue#RUMOUR=true wrongs.

Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Where is the earl?
Dialogue#Porter=What shall I say you are?
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Tell thou the earl
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.
Dialogue#Porter=His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard;
Dialogue#Porter=Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,
Dialogue#Porter=And he himself wilt answer.
Notice#Enter NORTHUMBERLAND
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Here comes the earl.
Notice#Exit Porter
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Should be the father of some stratagem:
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=The times are wild: contention, like a horse
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=And bears down all before him.
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Noble earl,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Good, an God will!
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=                  As good as heart can wish:
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=The king is almost wounded to the death;
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=And, in the fortune of my lord your son,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Came not till now to dignify the times,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Since Caesar's fortunes!
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=How is this derived?
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=A gentleman well bred and of good name,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=That freely render'd me these news for true.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=On Tuesday last to listen after news.
Notice#Enter TRAVERS
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=My lord, I over-rode him on the way;
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=And he is furnish'd with no certainties
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=More than he haply may retail from me.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?
Dialogue#TRAVERS=My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back
Dialogue#TRAVERS=With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,
Dialogue#TRAVERS=Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
Dialogue#TRAVERS=A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
Dialogue#TRAVERS=That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.
Dialogue#TRAVERS=He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him
Dialogue#TRAVERS=I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:
Dialogue#TRAVERS=He told me that rebellion had bad luck
Dialogue#TRAVERS=And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.
Dialogue#TRAVERS=With that, he gave his able horse the head,
Dialogue#TRAVERS=And bending forward struck his armed heels
Dialogue#TRAVERS=Against the panting sides of his poor jade
Dialogue#TRAVERS=Up to the rowel-head, and starting so
Dialogue#TRAVERS=He seem'd in running to devour the way,
Dialogue#TRAVERS=Staying no longer question.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Ha! Again:
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Had met ill luck?
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=                  My lord, I'll tell you what;
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=If my young lord your son have not the day,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Upon mine honour, for a silken point
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=I'll give my barony: never talk of it.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Give then such instances of loss?
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Who, he?
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=He was some hilding fellow that had stolen
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.
Notice#Enter MORTON
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Hath left a witness'd usurpation.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?
Dialogue#MORTON=I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;
Dialogue#MORTON=Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
Dialogue#MORTON=To fright our party.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=How doth my son and brother?
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'
Dialogue#MORTON=Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
Dialogue#MORTON=But, for my lord your son--
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Why, he is dead.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=He that but fears the thing he would not know
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Tell thou an earl his divination lies,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.
Dialogue#MORTON=You are too great to be by me gainsaid:
Dialogue#MORTON=Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=I see a strange confession in thine eye:
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=The tongue offends not that reports his death:
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Not he which says the dead is not alive.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Hath but a losing office, and his tongue
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Remember'd tolling a departing friend.
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.
Dialogue#MORTON=I am sorry I should force you to believe
Dialogue#MORTON=That which I would to God I had not seen;
Dialogue#MORTON=But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,
Dialogue#MORTON=Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,
Dialogue#MORTON=To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down
Dialogue#MORTON=The never-daunted Percy to the earth,
Dialogue#MORTON=From whence with life he never more sprung up.
Dialogue#MORTON=In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire
Dialogue#MORTON=Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,
Dialogue#MORTON=Being bruited once, took fire and heat away
Dialogue#MORTON=From the best temper'd courage in his troops;
Dialogue#MORTON=For from his metal was his party steel'd;
Dialogue#MORTON=Which once in him abated, all the rest
Dialogue#MORTON=Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:
Dialogue#MORTON=And as the thing that's heavy in itself,
Dialogue#MORTON=Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
Dialogue#MORTON=So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,
Dialogue#MORTON=Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
Dialogue#MORTON=That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
Dialogue#MORTON=Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,
Dialogue#MORTON=Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester
Dialogue#MORTON=Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,
Dialogue#MORTON=The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword
Dialogue#MORTON=Had three times slain the appearance of the king,
Dialogue#MORTON='Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
Dialogue#MORTON=Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,
Dialogue#MORTON=Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all
Dialogue#MORTON=Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out
Dialogue#MORTON=A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
Dialogue#MORTON=Under the conduct of young Lancaster
Dialogue#MORTON=And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=In poison there is physic; and these news,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Having been well, that would have made me sick,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Being sick, have in some measure made me well:
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=And let this world no longer be a stage
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=To feed contention in a lingering act;
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=But let one spirit of the first-born Cain
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=And darkness be the burier of the dead!
Dialogue#TRAVERS=This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.
Dialogue#MORTON=The lives of all your loving complices
Dialogue#MORTON=Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er
Dialogue#MORTON=To stormy passion, must perforce decay.
Dialogue#MORTON=You cast the event of war, my noble lord,
Dialogue#MORTON=And summ'd the account of chance, before you said
Dialogue#MORTON='Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,
Dialogue#MORTON=That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:
Dialogue#MORTON=You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,
Dialogue#MORTON=More likely to fall in than to get o'er;
Dialogue#MORTON=You were advised his flesh was capable
Dialogue#MORTON=Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
Dialogue#MORTON=Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:
Dialogue#MORTON=Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,
Dialogue#MORTON=Though strongly apprehended, could restrain
Dialogue#MORTON=The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,
Dialogue#MORTON=Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,
Dialogue#MORTON=More than that being which was like to be?
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=We all that are engaged to this loss
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=That if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one;
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd;
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=And since we are o'erset, venture again.
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.
Dialogue#MORTON='Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,
Dialogue#MORTON=I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,
Dialogue#MORTON=The gentle Archbishop of York is up
Dialogue#MORTON=With well-appointed powers: he is a man
Dialogue#MORTON=Who with a double surety binds his followers.
Dialogue#MORTON=My lord your son had only but the corpse,
Dialogue#MORTON=But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;
Dialogue#MORTON=For that same word, rebellion, did divide
Dialogue#MORTON=The action of their bodies from their souls;
Dialogue#MORTON=And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,
Dialogue#MORTON=As men drink potions, that their weapons only
Dialogue#MORTON=Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,
Dialogue#MORTON=This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,
Dialogue#MORTON=As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop
Dialogue#MORTON=Turns insurrection to religion:
Dialogue#MORTON=Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,
Dialogue#MORTON=He's followed both with body and with mind;
Dialogue#MORTON=And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
Dialogue#MORTON=Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;
Dialogue#MORTON=Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;
Dialogue#MORTON=Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,
Dialogue#MORTON=Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;
Dialogue#MORTON=And more and less do flock to follow him.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=This present grief had wiped it from my mind.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Go in with me; and counsel every man
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=The aptest way for safety and revenge:
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Never so few, and never yet more need.

Notice#Enter FALSTAFF, with his Page bearing his sword and buckler
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?
Dialogue#Page=He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy
Dialogue#Page=water; but, for the party that owed it, he might
Dialogue#Page=have more diseases than he knew for.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=prince put thee into my service for any other reason
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=send you back again to your master, for a jewel,--
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=the satin for my short cloak and my slops?
Dialogue#Page=He said, sir, you should procure him better
Dialogue#Page=assurance than Bardolph: he would not take his
Dialogue#Page=band and yours; he liked not the security.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God his
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=and then stand upon security! The whoreson
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=through with them in honest taking up, then they
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=must stand upon security. I had as lief they would
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=security. I looked a' should have sent me two and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Where's Bardolph?
Dialogue#Page=He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.
Notice#Enter the Lord Chief-Justice and Servant
Dialogue#Page=Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the
Dialogue#Page=Prince for striking him about Bardolph.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Wait, close; I will not see him.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	What's he that goes there?
Dialogue#Servant=Falstaff, an't please your lordship.
Dialogue#Servant=Lord Chief-Justice	He that was in question for the robbery?
Dialogue#Servant=He, my lord: but he hath since done good service at
Dialogue#Servant=Shrewsbury; and, as I hear, is now going with some
Dialogue#Servant=charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.
Dialogue#Servant=Lord Chief-Justice	What, to York? Call him back again.
Dialogue#Servant=Sir John Falstaff!
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Boy, tell him I am deaf.
Dialogue#Page=You must speak louder; my master is deaf.
Dialogue#Page=Lord Chief-Justice	I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.
Dialogue#Page=Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him.
Dialogue#Servant=Sir John!
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=wars? is there not employment? doth not the king
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=lack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=how to make it.
Dialogue#Servant=You mistake me, sir.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=in my throat, if I had said so.
Dialogue#Servant=I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our
Dialogue#Servant=soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you,
Dialogue#Servant=you lie in your throat, if you say I am any other
Dialogue#Servant=than an honest man.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=which grows to me! if thou gettest any leave of me,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=hang me; if thou takest leave, thou wert better be
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=hanged. You hunt counter: hence! avaunt!
Dialogue#Servant=Sir, my lord would speak with you.
Dialogue#Servant=Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=My good lord! God give your lordship good time of
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=of your health.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Shrewsbury.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=returned with some discomfort from Wales.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I sent for you.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=this same whoreson apoplexy.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=you.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=blood, a whoreson tingling.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	What tell you me of it? be it as it is.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=It hath its original from much grief, from study and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	I think you are fallen into the disease; for you
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=hear not what I say to you.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=of not marking, that I am troubled withal.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	To punish you by the heels would amend the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=attention of your ears; and I care not if I do
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=become your physician.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=your lordship may minister the potion of
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=should I be your patient to follow your
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	I sent for you, when there were matters against you
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=for your life, to come speak with me.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=laws of this land-service, I did not come.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I would it were otherwise; I would my means were
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=greater, and my waist slenderer.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	You have misled the youthful prince.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=with the great belly, and he my dog.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=that action.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=My lord?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=sleeping wolf.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=out.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=of wax, my growth would approve the truth.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	There is not a white hair on your face but should
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=have his effect of gravity.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	You follow the young prince up and down, like his
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=ill angel.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=costermonger times that true valour is turned
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=You that are old consider not the capacities of us
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=that are young; you do measure the heat of our
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=are wags too.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=that are written down old with all the characters of
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=every part about you blasted with antiquity? and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=afternoon, with a white head and something a round
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=and singing of anthems. To approve my youth
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=judgment and understanding; and he that will caper
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=and you took it like a sensible lord. I have
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=and old sack.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	Well, God send the prince a better companion!
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=God send the companion a better prince! I cannot
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=rid my hands of him.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: I
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=against the Archbishop and the Earl of
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Northumberland.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=might never spit white again. There is not a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=dangerous action can peep out his head but I am
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=they have a good thing, to make it too common. If
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=me rest. I would to God my name were not so
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=nothing with perpetual motion.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=expedition!
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=furnish me forth?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=bear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to my

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=What money is in my purse?
Dialogue#Page=Seven groats and two pence.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I can get no remedy against this consumption of the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=purse: borrowing only lingers and lingers it out,

Notice#Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the Lords HASTINGS, MOWBRAY, and BARDOLPH
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=I well allow the occasion of our arms;
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=But gladly would be better satisfied
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=How in our means we should advance ourselves
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=To look with forehead bold and big enough
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Upon the power and puissance of the king.
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Our present musters grow upon the file
Dialogue#HASTINGS=To five and twenty thousand men of choice;
Dialogue#HASTINGS=And our supplies live largely in the hope
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
Dialogue#HASTINGS=With an incensed fire of injuries.
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Whether our present five and twenty thousand
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=May hold up head without Northumberland?
Dialogue#HASTINGS=With him, we may.
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=                  Yea, marry, there's the point:
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=But if without him we be thought too feeble,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=My judgment is, we should not step too far
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Till we had his assistance by the hand;
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=For in a theme so bloody-faced as this
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Conjecture, expectation, and surmise
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Of aids incertain should not be admitted.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK='Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Eating the air on promise of supply,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Flattering himself in project of a power
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=And so, with great imagination
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Proper to madmen, led his powers to death
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=And winking leap'd into destruction.
Dialogue#HASTINGS=But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
Dialogue#HASTINGS=To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Yes, if this present quality of war,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Lives so in hope as in an early spring
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Hope gives not so much warrant as despair
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=We first survey the plot, then draw the model;
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=And when we see the figure of the house,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Then must we rate the cost of the erection;
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Which if we find outweighs ability,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=What do we then but draw anew the model
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=In fewer offices, or at last desist
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=To build at all? Much more, in this great work,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=And set another up, should we survey
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=The plot of situation and the model,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Consent upon a sure foundation,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Question surveyors, know our own estate,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=How able such a work to undergo,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=To weigh against his opposite; or else
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=We fortify in paper and in figures,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Using the names of men instead of men:
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Like one that draws the model of a house
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=A naked subject to the weeping clouds
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd
Dialogue#HASTINGS=The utmost man of expectation,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=I think we are a body strong enough,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Even as we are, to equal with the king.
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?
Dialogue#HASTINGS=To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.
Dialogue#HASTINGS=For his divisions, as the times do brawl,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Are in three heads: one power against the French,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=And one against Glendower; perforce a third
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Must take up us: so is the unfirm king
Dialogue#HASTINGS=In three divided; and his coffers sound
Dialogue#HASTINGS=With hollow poverty and emptiness.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=That he should draw his several strengths together
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And come against us in full puissance,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Need not be dreaded.
Dialogue#HASTINGS=If he should do so,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Baying him at the heels: never fear that.
Dialogue#LORD BARDOLPH=Who is it like should lead his forces hither?
Dialogue#HASTINGS=The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:
Dialogue#HASTINGS=But who is substituted 'gainst the French,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=I have no certain notice.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Let us on,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And publish the occasion of our arms.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=An habitation giddy and unsure
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=O thou fond many, with what loud applause
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And howl'st to find it. What trust is in
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=these times?
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Are now become enamour'd on his grave:
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=When through proud London he came sighing on
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed!
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Past and to come seems best; things present worst.
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?

Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=Yea, good Master Snare; I have entered him and all.
Dialogue#SNARE=It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.
Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabbed me in
Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=mine own house, and that most beastly: in good

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	How comes this, Sir John? Fie! what man of good
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=What is the gross sum that I owe thee?
Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=that come with such more than impudent sauciness
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=from you, can thrust me from a level consideration:
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=you have, as it appears to me, practised upon the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=serve your uses both in purse and in person.
Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=Yea, in truth, my lord.
Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=Lord Chief-Justice	Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, and
Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=unpay the villany you have done her: the one you
Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=may do with sterling money, and the other with
Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=current repentance.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=reply. You call honourable boldness impudent
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=sauciness: if a man will make courtesy and say
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=nothing, he is virtuous: no, my lord, my humble
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers,

Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fain

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=the Prodigal, or the German hunting in water-work,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=is worth a thousand of these bed-hangings and these

Dialogue#GOWER=Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Comes the king back from Wales, my noble lord?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	You shall have letters of me presently:

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=My lord!
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	What's the matter?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner?

Dialogue#GOWER=take soldiers up in counties as you go.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Will you sup with me, Master Gower?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Lord Chief-Justice	What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir John?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fool
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=that taught them me. This is the right fencing
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=grace, my lord; tap for tap, and so part fair.

Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Before God, I am exceeding weary.
Dialogue#POINS=Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not
Dialogue#POINS=have attached one of so high blood.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Faith, it does me; though it discolours the
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?
Dialogue#POINS=Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as
Dialogue#POINS=to remember so weak a composition.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=small beer. But, indeed, these humble
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=considerations make me out of love with my
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=take note how many pair of silk stockings thou
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=hast, viz. these, and those that were thy
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=a great while, because the rest of thy low
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=midwives say the children are not in the fault;
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=mightily strengthened.
Dialogue#POINS=How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,
Dialogue#POINS=you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good
Dialogue#POINS=young princes would do so, their fathers being so
Dialogue#POINS=sick as yours at this time is?
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?
Dialogue#POINS=Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.
Dialogue#POINS=Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you
Dialogue#POINS=will tell.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=indeed too.
Dialogue#POINS=Very hardly upon such a subject.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art

Dialogue#POINS=The reason?
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?
Dialogue#POINS=I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=It would be every man's thought; and thou art a
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=better than thine: every man would think me an
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=worshipful thought to think so?
Dialogue#POINS=Why, because you have been so lewd and so much
Dialogue#POINS=engraffed to Falstaff.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=And to thee.
Dialogue#POINS=By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it
Dialogue#POINS=with my own ears: the worst that they can say of
Dialogue#POINS=me is that I am a second brother and that I am a
Dialogue#POINS=proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I
Dialogue#POINS=confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.

Dialogue#BARDOLPH=Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you

Dialogue#Page=A' calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red
Dialogue#Page=lattice, and I could discern no part of his face
Dialogue#Page=from the window: at last I spied his eyes, and
Dialogue#Page=methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife's
Dialogue#Page=new petticoat and so peeped through.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Has not the boy profited?
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!
Dialogue#Page=Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?
Dialogue#Page=Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamed she was delivered
Dialogue#Page=of a fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.

Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=And how doth thy master, Bardolph?
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=Well, my lord. He heard of your grace's coming to
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=town: there's a letter for you.
Dialogue#POINS=Delivered with good respect. And how doth the
Dialogue#POINS=martlemas, your master?
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=In bodily health, sir.
Dialogue#POINS=Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; but
Dialogue#POINS=that moves not him: though that be sick, it dies
Dialogue#POINS=not.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=dog; and he holds his place; for look you how be writes.
Dialogue#POINS=[Reads]  'John Falstaff, knight,'--every man must
Dialogue#POINS=know that, as oft as he has occasion to name
Dialogue#POINS=himself: even like those that are kin to the king;
Dialogue#POINS=for they never prick their finger but they say,
Dialogue#POINS='There's some of the king's blood spilt.' 'How
Dialogue#POINS=comes that?' says he, that takes upon him not to
Dialogue#POINS=conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower's
Dialogue#POINS=cap, 'I am the king's poor cousin, sir.'
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=from Japhet. But to the letter.
Dialogue#POINS=[Reads]  'Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son of
Dialogue#POINS=the king, nearest his father, Harry Prince of
Dialogue#POINS=Wales, greeting.' Why, this is a certificate.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Peace!
Dialogue#POINS=[Reads]  'I will imitate the honourable Romans in
Dialogue#POINS=brevity:' he sure means brevity in breath,
Dialogue#POINS=short-winded. 'I commend me to thee, I commend
Dialogue#POINS=thee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with
Dialogue#POINS=Poins; for he misuses thy favours so much, that he
Dialogue#POINS=swears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repent
Dialogue#POINS=at idle times as thou mayest; and so, farewell.
Dialogue#POINS=Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as to
Dialogue#POINS=say, as thou usest him, JACK FALSTAFF with my
Dialogue#POINS=familiars, JOHN with my brothers and sisters,
Dialogue#POINS=and SIR JOHN with all Europe.'
Dialogue#POINS=My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=you use me thus, Ned? must I marry your sister?
Dialogue#POINS=God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Is your master here in London?
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=Yea, my lord.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Where sups he? doth the old boar feed in the old frank?

Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Sup any women with him?
Dialogue#Page=None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and

Dialogue#Page=A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=bull. Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?
Dialogue#POINS=I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=master that I am yet come to town: there's for
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=your silence.

Notice#Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.

Dialogue#POINS=Alban's and London.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=in his true colours, and not ourselves be seen?
Dialogue#POINS=Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait
Dialogue#POINS=upon him at his table as drawers.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=From a God to a bull? a heavy decension! it was
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Jove's case. From a prince to a prentice? a low

Dialogue#LADY PERCY=Did all the chivalry of England move

Dialogue#LADY PERCY=Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,
Dialogue#LADY PERCY=To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck,
Dialogue#LADY PERCY=Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave.
Dialogue#NORTHUMBERLAND=Beshrew your heart,

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=as Tewksbury mustard; there's no more conceit in him
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=than is in a mallet.
Dialogue#DOLL TEARSHEET=Why does the prince love him so, then?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Because their legs are both of a bigness, and a'
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=and drinks off candles' ends for flap-dragons, and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=rides the wild-mare with the boys, and jumps upon

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=stories; and such other gambol faculties a' has,

Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Very true, sir; and I come to draw you out by the ears.
Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=O, the Lord preserve thy good grace! by my troth,
Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=welcome to London. Now, the Lord bless that sweet
Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=face of thine! O, Jesu, are you come from Wales?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty, by this light
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=flesh and corrupt blood, thou art welcome.
Dialogue#DOLL TEARSHEET=How, you fat fool! I scorn you.
Dialogue#POINS=My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge and
Dialogue#POINS=turn all to a merriment, if you take not the heat.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=You whoreson candle-mine, you, how vilely did you
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=speak of me even now before this honest, virtuous,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=civil gentlewoman!

Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=by my troth.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Didst thou hear me?
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Yea, and you knew me, as you did when you ran away
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=by Gad's-hill: you knew I was at your back, and
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=spoke it on purpose to try my patience.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=No, no, no; not so; I did not think thou wast within hearing.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=I shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse;
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=and then I know how to handle you.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=No abuse, Hal, o' mine honour, no abuse.

Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=bread-chipper and I know not what?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=No abuse, Hal.
Dialogue#POINS=No abuse?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=No abuse, Ned, i' the world; honest Ned, none. I
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=dispraised him before the wicked, that the wicked
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=might not fall in love with him; in which doing, I
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=have done the part of a careful friend and a true
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=subject, and thy father is to give me thanks for it.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=No abuse, Hal: none, Ned, none: no, faith, boys, none.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=See now, whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=close with us? is she of the wicked? is thine
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=hostess here of the wicked? or is thy boy of the
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=wicked? or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in his
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=nose, of the wicked?
Dialogue#POINS=Answer, thou dead elm, answer.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable;
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=and his face is Lucifer's privy-kitchen, where he
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=doth nothing but roast malt-worms. For the boy,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=there is a good angel about him; but the devil
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=outbids him too.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=For the women?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=For one of them, she is in hell already, and burns
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=poor souls. For the other, I owe her money, and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=whether she be damned for that, I know not.
Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=No, I warrant you.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=No, I think thou art not; I think thou art quit for
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=that. Marry, there is another indictment upon thee,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=contrary to the law; for the which I think thou wilt howl.
Dialogue#MISTRESS QUICKLY=All victuallers do so; what's a joint of mutton or

Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=You, gentlewoman,-
Dialogue#DOLL TEARSHEET=What says your grace?

Dialogue#SHALLOW=It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said
Dialogue#SHALLOW=indeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,
Dialogue#SHALLOW=indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?
Dialogue#FEEBLE=I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Well said, good woman's tailor! well said,

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Never, never; she would always say she could not
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=abide Master Shallow.
Dialogue#SHALLOW=By the mass, I could anger her to the heart. She
Dialogue#SHALLOW=was then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Old, old, Master Shallow.
Dialogue#SHALLOW=Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;
Dialogue#SHALLOW=certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork by old
Dialogue#SHALLOW=Nightwork before I came to Clement's Inn.
Dialogue#SILENCE=That's fifty-five year ago.
Dialogue#SHALLOW=Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that
Dialogue#SHALLOW=this knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.
Dialogue#SHALLOW=That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith,
Dialogue#SHALLOW=Sir John, we have: our watch-word was 'Hem boys!'
Dialogue#SHALLOW=Come, let's to dinner; come, let's to dinner:
Dialogue#SHALLOW=Jesus, the days that we have seen! Come, come.

Dialogue#BULLCALF=and here's four Harry ten shillings in French crowns
Dialogue#BULLCALF=for you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief be
Dialogue#BULLCALF=hanged, sir, as go: and yet, for mine own part, sir,
Dialogue#BULLCALF=I do not care; but rather, because I am unwilling,
Dialogue#BULLCALF=and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with
Dialogue#BULLCALF=my friends; else, sir, I did not care, for mine own
Dialogue#BULLCALF=part, so much.
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=Go to; stand aside.
Dialogue#MOULDY=And, good master corporal captain, for my old
Dialogue#MOULDY=dame's sake, stand my friend: she has nobody to do
Dialogue#MOULDY=any thing about her when I am gone; and she is old,
Dialogue#MOULDY=and cannot help herself: You shall have forty, sir.
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=Go to; stand aside.
Dialogue#FEEBLE=By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once: we
Dialogue#FEEBLE=owe God a death: I'll ne'er bear a base mind:
Dialogue#FEEBLE=an't be my destiny, so; an't be not, so: no man is
Dialogue#FEEBLE=too good to serve's prince; and let it go which way
Dialogue#FEEBLE=it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=Well said; thou'rt a good fellow.

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Come, sir, which men shall I have?
Dialogue#SHALLOW=Four of which you please.
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=Sir, a word with you: I have three pound to free
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=Mouldy and Bullcalf.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Go to; well.
Dialogue#SHALLOW=Come, Sir John, which four will you have?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Do you choose for me.
Dialogue#SHALLOW=Marry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble and Shadow.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=till you are past service: and for your part,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Bullcalf, grow till you come unto it: I will none of you.
Dialogue#SHALLOW=Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they are
Dialogue#SHALLOW=your likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=man? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=spirit, Master Shallow. Here's Wart; you see what a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=ragged appearance it is; a' shall charge you and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=on the brewer's bucket. And this same half-faced
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=fellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents no
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=Hold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Come, manage me your caliver. So: very well: go
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=to: very good, exceeding good. O, give me always a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=little, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i'
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=faith, Wart; thou'rt a good scab: hold, there's a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=tester for thee.
Dialogue#SHALLOW=He is not his craft's master; he doth not do it
Dialogue#SHALLOW=right. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at
Dialogue#SHALLOW=Clement's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's
Dialogue#SHALLOW=show,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a'
Dialogue#SHALLOW=would manage you his piece thus; and a' would about
Dialogue#SHALLOW=and about, and come you in and come you in: 'rah,
Dialogue#SHALLOW=tah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce' would a' say; and
Dialogue#SHALLOW=away again would a' go, and again would a' come: I
Dialogue#SHALLOW=shall ne'er see such a fellow.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. God
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=keep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=with you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thank
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=you: I must a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, give
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=the soldiers coats.
Dialogue#SHALLOW=Sir John, the Lord bless you! God prosper your
Dialogue#SHALLOW=affairs! God send us peace! At your return visit
Dialogue#SHALLOW=our house; let our old acquaintance be renewed;
Dialogue#SHALLOW=peradventure I will with ye to the court.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF='Fore God, I would you would, Master Shallow.
Dialogue#SHALLOW=Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Fare you well, gentle gentlemen.

Notice# c
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.

Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=To know the numbers of our enemies.
Dialogue#HASTINGS=We have sent forth already.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK='Tis well done.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=My friends and brethren in these great affairs,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=I must acquaint you that I have received
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=New-dated letters from Northumberland;
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Here doth he wish his person, with such powers

Dialogue#Messenger=West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,
Dialogue#Messenger=In goodly form comes on the enemy;
Dialogue#Messenger=And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number
Dialogue#Messenger=Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=The just proportion that we gave them out
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Let us sway on and face them in the field.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=What well-appointed leader fronts us here?
Notice#Enter WESTMORELAND
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Health and fair greeting from our general,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=What doth concern your coming?
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Then, my lord,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Unto your grace do I in chief address
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=The substance of my speech. If that rebellion
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Came like itself, in base and abject routs,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=And countenanced by boys and beggary,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=In his true, native and most proper shape,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=You, reverend father, and these noble lords
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Had not been here, to dress the ugly form
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Of base and bloody insurrection
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Whose white investments figure innocence,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Your pens to lances and your tongue divine
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=To a trumpet and a point of war?
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And we must bleed for it; of which disease
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=I take not on me here as a physician,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Nor do I as an enemy to peace
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Troop in the throngs of military men;
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=But rather show awhile like fearful war,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=To diet rank minds sick of happiness
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And purge the obstructions which begin to stop
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=I have in equal balance justly weigh'd
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And find our griefs heavier than our offences.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=We see which way the stream of time doth run,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And are enforced from our most quiet there
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=By the rough torrent of occasion;
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And have the summary of all our griefs,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=When time shall serve, to show in articles;
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And might by no suit gain our audience:
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=We are denied access unto his person
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Even by those men that most have done us wrong.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=The dangers of the days but newly gone,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Whose memory is written on the earth
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=With yet appearing blood, and the examples
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Of every minute's instance, present now,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Not to break peace or any branch of it,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=But to establish here a peace indeed,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Concurring both in name and quality.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=When ever yet was your appeal denied?
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Wherein have you been galled by the king?
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=That you should seal this lawless bloody book
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Of forged rebellion with a seal divine
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=My brother general, the commonwealth,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=To brother born an household cruelty,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=I make my quarrel in particular.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=There is no need of any such redress;
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Or if there were, it not belongs to you.
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Why not to him in part, and to us all
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=That feel the bruises of the days before,
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=And suffer the condition of these times
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=To lay a heavy and unequal hand
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Upon our honours?
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=                  O, my good Lord Mowbray,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Construe the times to their necessities,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=And you shall say indeed, it is the time,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=And not the king, that doth you injuries.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Yet for your part, it not appears to me
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Either from the king or in the present time
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=That you should have an inch of any ground
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=To build a grief on: were you not restored
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Your noble and right well remember'd father's?
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=What thing, in honour, had my father lost,
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=That need to be revived and breathed in me?
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=The king that loved him, as the state stood then,
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Being mounted and both roused in their seats,
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=And the loud trumpet blowing them together,
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=O when the king did throw his warder down,
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=His own life hung upon the staff he threw;
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Then threw he down himself and all their lives
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=That by indictment and by dint of sword
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=The Earl of Hereford was reputed then
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=In England the most valiant gentlemen:
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=But if your father had been victor there,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=For all the country in a general voice
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=But this is mere digression from my purpose.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Here come I from our princely general
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=That he will give you audience; and wherein
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=It shall appear that your demands are just,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=You shall enjoy them, every thing set off
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=That might so much as think you enemies.
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=But he hath forced us to compel this offer;
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=And it proceeds from policy, not love.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Mowbray, you overween to take it so;
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=For, lo! within a ken our army lies,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Upon mine honour, all too confident
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=To give admittance to a thought of fear.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Our battle is more full of names than yours,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Our men more perfect in the use of arms,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Then reason will our heart should be as good
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Say you not then our offer is compell'd.
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=That argues but the shame of your offence:
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=A rotten case abides no handling.
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Hath the Prince John a full commission,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=In very ample virtue of his father,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=To hear and absolutely to determine
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Of what conditions we shall stand upon?
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=That is intended in the general's name:
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=I muse you make so slight a question.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=For this contains our general grievances:
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Each several article herein redress'd,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=All members of our cause, both here and hence,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=That are insinew'd to this action,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Acquitted by a true substantial form
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And present execution of our wills
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=To us and to our purposes confined,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=We come within our awful banks again
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And knit our powers to the arm of peace.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=This will I show the general. Please you, lords,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=In sight of both our battles we may meet;
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=And either end in peace, which God so frame!
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Or to the place of difference call the swords
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Which must decide it.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=My lord, we will do so.
Notice#Exit WESTMORELAND
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=There is a thing within my bosom tells me
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=That no conditions of our peace can stand.
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Fear you not that: if we can make our peace
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Upon such large terms and so absolute
Dialogue#HASTINGS=As our conditions shall consist upon,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Yea, but our valuation shall be such
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=That every slight and false-derived cause,
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Shall to the king taste of this action;
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=And good from bad find no partition.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Of dainty and such picking grievances:
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=For he hath found to end one doubt by death
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Revives two greater in the heirs of life,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And therefore will he wipe his tables clean
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And keep no tell-tale to his memory
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=That may repeat and history his loss
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=To new remembrance; for full well he knows
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=He cannot so precisely weed this land
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=As his misdoubts present occasion:
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=His foes are so enrooted with his friends
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=That, plucking to unfix an enemy,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=So that this land, like an offensive wife
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=As he is striking, holds his infant up
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And hangs resolved correction in the arm
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=That was uprear'd to execution.
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods
Dialogue#HASTINGS=On late offenders, that he now doth lack
Dialogue#HASTINGS=The very instruments of chastisement:
Dialogue#HASTINGS=So that his power, like to a fangless lion,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=May offer, but not hold.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK='Tis very true:
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=If we do now make our atonement well,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Our peace will, like a broken limb united,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Grow stronger for the breaking.
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Be it so.
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.

Dialogue#LANCASTER=My Lord of York, it better show'd with you
Dialogue#LANCASTER=When that your flock, assembled by the bell,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Encircled you to hear with reverence
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Your exposition on the holy text
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Than now to see you here an iron man,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Turning the word to sword and life to death.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=That man that sits within a monarch's heart,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Would he abuse the countenance of the king,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Alack, what mischiefs might he set abrooch
Dialogue#LANCASTER=In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken
Dialogue#LANCASTER=How deep you were within the books of God?
Dialogue#LANCASTER=To us the speaker in his parliament;
Dialogue#LANCASTER=To us the imagined voice of God himself;
Dialogue#LANCASTER=The very opener and intelligencer
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven
Dialogue#LANCASTER=And our dull workings. O, who shall believe
Dialogue#LANCASTER=But you misuse the reverence of your place,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=As a false favourite doth his prince's name,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Under the counterfeited zeal of God,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=The subjects of his substitute, my father,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=And both against the peace of heaven and him
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Have here up-swarm'd them.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Good my Lord of Lancaster,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=I am not here against your father's peace;
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=To hold our safety up. I sent your grace
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=The parcels and particulars of our grief,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=With grant of our most just and right desires,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And true obedience, of this madness cured,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=If not, we ready are to try our fortunes
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=To the last man.
Dialogue#HASTINGS=                  And though we here fall down,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=We have supplies to second our attempt:
Dialogue#HASTINGS=If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;
Dialogue#HASTINGS=And so success of mischief shall be born
Dialogue#HASTINGS=And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Whiles England shall have generation.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=To sound the bottom of the after-times.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=How far forth you do like their articles.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=I like them all, and do allow them well,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=And swear here, by the honour of my blood,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=My father's purposes have been mistook,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=And some about him have too lavishly
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Wrested his meaning and authority.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Discharge your powers unto their several counties,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=As we will ours: and here between the armies
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Let's drink together friendly and embrace,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=That all their eyes may bear those tokens home

Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=I have bestow'd to breed this present peace,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=You would drink freely: but my love to ye
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Shall show itself more openly hereafter.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=I do not doubt you.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=I am glad of it.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=You wish me health in very happy season;
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=For I am, on the sudden, something ill.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Against ill chances men are ever merry;
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=But heaviness foreruns the good event.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Serves to say thus, 'some good thing comes
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=to-morrow.'
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=So much the worse, if your own rule be true.
Notice#Shouts within
Dialogue#LANCASTER=The word of peace is render'd: hark, how they shout!
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=This had been cheerful after victory.
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=A peace is of the nature of a conquest;
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=For then both parties nobly are subdued,
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=And neither party loser.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Go, my lord,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=And let our army be discharged too.
Notice#Exit WESTMORELAND
Dialogue#LANCASTER=And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains

Dialogue#HASTINGS=East, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,
Dialogue#HASTINGS=Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=And you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Of capitol treason I attach you both.
Dialogue#MOWBRAY=Is this proceeding just and honourable?
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Is your assembly so?
Dialogue#ARCHBISHOP OF YORK=Will you thus break your faith?
Dialogue#LANCASTER=I pawn'd thee none:
Dialogue#LANCASTER=I promised you redress of these same grievances
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=I will perform with a most Christian care.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=But for you, rebels, look to taste the due
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Most shallowly did you these arms commence,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Strike up our drums, pursue the scatter'd stray:

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=What's your name, sir? of what condition are you,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=and of what place, I pray?
Dialogue#COLEVILE=I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the dale.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=degree, and your place the dale: Colevile shall be
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=still your name, a traitor your degree, and the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=dungeon your place, a place deep enough; so shall
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=you be still Colevile of the dale.
Dialogue#COLEVILE=Are not you Sir John Falstaff?
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do ye
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=yield, sir? or shall I sweat for you? if I do
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=sweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and they
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=weep for thy death: therefore rouse up fear and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=trembling, and do observance to my mercy.
Dialogue#COLEVILE=I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that
Dialogue#COLEVILE=thought yield me.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=word but my name. An I had but a belly of any
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=indifference, I were simply the most active fellow
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=in Europe: my womb, my womb, my womb, undoes me.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Here comes our general.
Notice#Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER, WESTMORELAND, BLUNT, and others

Dialogue#LANCASTER=Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland.
Notice#Exit WESTMORELAND
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?
Dialogue#LANCASTER=When every thing is ended, then you come:
Dialogue#LANCASTER=These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=One time or other break some gallows' back.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=of valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=bullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=the very extremest inch of possibility; I have
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=foundered nine score and odd posts: and here,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=But what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF='I came, saw, and overcame.'
Dialogue#LANCASTER=It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I know not: here he is, and here I yield him: and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I beseech your grace, let it be booked with the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=rest of this day's deeds; or, by the Lord, I will
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=have it in a particular ballad else, with mine own
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=picture on the top on't, Colevile kissing my foot:
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=to the which course if I be enforced, if you do not
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=all show like gilt twopences to me, and I in the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=moon doth the cinders of the element, which show
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=like pins' heads to her, believe not the word of
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=the noble: therefore let me have right, and let
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=desert mount.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Thine's too heavy to mount.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Let it shine, then.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Thine's too thick to shine.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=good, and call it what you will.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Is thy name Colevile?
Dialogue#COLEVILE=It is, my lord.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=And a famous true subject took him.
Dialogue#COLEVILE=I am, my lord, but as my betters are
Dialogue#COLEVILE=That led me hither: had they been ruled by me,
Dialogue#COLEVILE=You should have won them dearer than you have.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I know not how they sold themselves: but thou, like
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis; and I
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=thank thee for thee.
Notice#Re-enter WESTMORELAND
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Now, have you left pursuit?

Notice#Exeunt BLUNT and others with COLEVILE
Dialogue#LANCASTER=And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords:

Dialogue#LANCASTER=Our news shall go before us to his majesty,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=And we with sober speed will follow you.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=My lord, I beseech you, give me leave to go
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Through Gloucestershire: and, when you come to court,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Stand my good lord, pray, in your good report.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Fare you well, Falstaff: I, in my condition,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
Notice#Exeunt all but Falstaff
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=There's never none of these demure boys come to any
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=kind of male green-sickness; and then when they
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=excellent wit. The second property of your
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=which, before cold and settled, left the liver
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=the heart, who, great and puffed up with this
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=sack commences it and sets it in act and use.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=would teach them should be, to forswear thin
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=potations and to addict themselves to sack.
Notice#Enter BARDOLPH
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=How now Bardolph?
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=The army is discharged all and gone.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Let them go. I'll through Gloucestershire; and

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=my thumb, and shortly will I seal with him. Come away.

Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Now, lords, if God doth give successful end
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=We will our youth lead on to higher fields
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And draw no swords but what are sanctified.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Our navy is address'd, our power collected,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Our substitutes in absence well invested,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And every thing lies level to our wish:
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Only, we want a little personal strength;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And pause us, till these rebels, now afoot,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Come underneath the yoke of government.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Both which we doubt not but your majesty
Dialogue#WARWICK=Shall soon enjoy.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=                  Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Where is the prince your brother?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And how accompanied?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=I do not know, my lord.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=No, my good lord; he is in presence here.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=What would my lord and father?
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Thou hast a better place in his affection
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And noble offices thou mayst effect
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Of mediation, after I am dead,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Between his greatness and thy other brethren:
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=By seeming cold or careless of his will;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=For he is gracious, if he be observed:
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=He hath a tear for pity and a hand
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Open as day for melting charity:
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=As humorous as winter and as sudden
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=As flaws congealed in the spring of day.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=His temper, therefore, must be well observed:
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=But, being moody, give him line and scope,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=That the united vessel of their blood,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Mingled with venom of suggestion--
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=As, force perforce, the age will pour it in--
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Shall never leak, though it do work as strong
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=As aconitum or rash gunpowder.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=I shall observe him with all care and love.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=He is not there to-day; he dines in London.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And how accompanied? canst thou tell that?
Dialogue#CLARENCE=With Poins, and other his continual followers.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And he, the noble image of my youth,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Is overspread with them: therefore my grief
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Stretches itself beyond the hour of death:
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=In forms imaginary the unguided days
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And rotten times that you shall look upon
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=When I am sleeping with my ancestors.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=When means and lavish manners meet together,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=O, with what wings shall his affections fly
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!
Dialogue#WARWICK=My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:
Dialogue#WARWICK=The prince but studies his companions
Dialogue#WARWICK=Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,
Dialogue#WARWICK='Tis needful that the most immodest word
Dialogue#WARWICK=Be look'd upon and learn'd; which once attain'd,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Your highness knows, comes to no further use
Dialogue#WARWICK=But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,
Dialogue#WARWICK=The prince will in the perfectness of time
Dialogue#WARWICK=Cast off his followers; and their memory
Dialogue#WARWICK=Shall as a pattern or a measure live,
Dialogue#WARWICK=By which his grace must mete the lives of others,
Dialogue#WARWICK=Turning past evils to advantages.

Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And wherefore should these good news make me sick?
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Will fortune never come with both hands full,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=But write her fair words still in foulest letters?
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=She either gives a stomach and no food;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Such are the poor, in health; or else a feast
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And takes away the stomach; such are the rich,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=That have abundance and enjoy it not.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=I should rejoice now at this happy news;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy:
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=O me! come near me; now I am much ill.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Comfort, your majesty!
Dialogue#CLARENCE=O my royal father!
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Be patient, princes; you do know, these fits
Dialogue#WARWICK=Are with his highness very ordinary.
Dialogue#WARWICK=Stand from him. Give him air; he'll straight be well.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs:
Dialogue#CLARENCE=The incessant care and labour of his mind
Dialogue#CLARENCE=Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
Dialogue#CLARENCE=So thin that life looks through and will break out.
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The people fear me; for they do observe
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature:
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=The seasons change their manners, as the year
Dialogue#GLOUCESTER=Had found some months asleep and leap'd them over.
Dialogue#CLARENCE=The river hath thrice flow'd, no ebb between;
Dialogue#CLARENCE=And the old folk, time's doting chronicles,

Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=To stab at half an hour of my life.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Only compound me with forgotten dust
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=For now a time is come to mock at form:
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Harry the Fifth is crown'd: up, vanity!
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And to the English court assemble now,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=From every region, apes of idleness!
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Be happy, he will trouble you no more;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=England shall double gild his treble guilt,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=England shall give him office, honour, might;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=When that my care could not withhold thy riots,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=The moist impediments unto my speech,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=The course of it so far. There is your crown;
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=And He that wears the crown immortally
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Long guard it yours! If I affect it more
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Than as your honour and as your renown,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Let me no more from this obedience rise,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Which my most inward true and duteous spirit
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=God witness with me, when I here came in,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=And found no course of breath within your majesty,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=O, let me in my present wildness die
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=And never live to show the incredulous world
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=The noble change that I have purposed!
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=I spake unto this crown as having sense,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Hath fed upon the body of my father;
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Preserving life in medicine potable;
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Accusing it, I put it on my head,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=To try with it, as with an enemy
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=That had before my face murder'd my father,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=The quarrel of a true inheritor.
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=But if it did infect my blood with joy,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Did with the least affection of a welcome
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Give entertainment to the might of it,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Let God for ever keep it from my head
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=And make me as the poorest vassal is
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=O my son,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=God put it in thy mind to take it hence,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And hear, I think, the very latest counsel
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=I met this crown; and I myself know well
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=How troublesome it sat upon my head.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Better opinion, better confirmation;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=For all the soil of the achievement goes
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=With me into the earth. It seem'd in me
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And I had many living to upbraid
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=My gain of it by their assistances;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Thou see'st with peril I have answered;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=For all my reign hath been but as a scene
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Acting that argument: and now my death
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=So thou the garland wear'st successively.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=By whose fell working I was first advanced
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=To be again displaced: which to avoid,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=I cut them off; and had a purpose now
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=To lead out many to the Holy Land,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Lest rest and lying still might make them look
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=May waste the memory of the former days.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=More would I, but my lungs are wasted so
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=That strength of speech is utterly denied me.
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=How I came by the crown, O God forgive;
Dialogue#KING HENRY IV=And grant it may with thee in true peace live!
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=My gracious liege,
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Then plain and right must my possession be:
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY=Which I with more than with a common pain
Dialogue#PRINCE HENRY='Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.

Dialogue#DAVY=Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?
Dialogue#SHALLOW=Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i' the

Dialogue#DAVY=I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but
Dialogue#DAVY=yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some
Dialogue#DAVY=countenance at his friend's request. An honest
Dialogue#DAVY=man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave
Dialogue#DAVY=is not. I have served your worship truly, sir,
Dialogue#DAVY=this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in
Dialogue#DAVY=a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I
Dialogue#DAVY=have but a very little credit with your worship. The

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And struck me in my very seat of judgment;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Whereon, as an offender to your father,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=I gave bold way to my authority
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And did commit you. If the deed were ill,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Be you contented, wearing now the garland,

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=To pluck down justice from your awful bench,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=To trip the course of law and blunt the sword
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That guards the peace and safety of your person;

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=To mock the expectation of the world,

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And flow henceforth in formal majesty.

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=to shift me,--
Dialogue#SHALLOW=It is best, certain.

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=desire to see him; thinking of nothing else,
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if there

Dialogue#FALSTAFF=him: look you, he must seem thus to the world:
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=fear not your advancements; I will be the man yet
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=that shall make you great.
Dialogue#SHALLOW=I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give
Dialogue#SHALLOW=me your doublet and stuff me out with straw. I
Dialogue#SHALLOW=beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred
Dialogue#SHALLOW=of my thousand.
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=Sir, I will be as good as my word: this that you
Dialogue#FALSTAFF=heard was but a colour.
Dialogue#SHALLOW=A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.

Notice#Spoken by a Dancer
Dialogue#LANCASTER=First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;
Dialogue#LANCASTER=and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look
Dialogue#LANCASTER=for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have
Dialogue#LANCASTER=to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I
Dialogue#LANCASTER=should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it
Dialogue#LANCASTER=known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here
Dialogue#LANCASTER=in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your
Dialogue#LANCASTER=patience for it and to promise you a better. I
Dialogue#LANCASTER=meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an
Dialogue#LANCASTER=ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and
Dialogue#LANCASTER=you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you
Dialogue#LANCASTER=I would be and here I commit my body to your
Dialogue#LANCASTER=mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will
Dialogue#LANCASTER=you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but
Dialogue#LANCASTER=light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a
Dialogue#LANCASTER=good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have
Dialogue#LANCASTER=forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the
Dialogue#LANCASTER=gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which
Dialogue#LANCASTER=was never seen before in such an assembly.
Dialogue#LANCASTER=One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too
Dialogue#LANCASTER=much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will
Dialogue#LANCASTER=continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make
Dialogue#LANCASTER=you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for
Dialogue#LANCASTER=any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,
Dialogue#LANCASTER=unless already a' be killed with your hard
Dialogue#LANCASTER=opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is
Dialogue#LANCASTER=not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are
Dialogue#LANCASTER=too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down
Dialogue#LANCASTER=before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.
