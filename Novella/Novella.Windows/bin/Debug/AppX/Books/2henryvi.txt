Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Did he so often lodge in open field,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=To conquer France, his true inheritance?

Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And shall these labours and these honours die?
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=O peers of England, shameful is this league!

Dialogue:SALISBURY=These counties were the keys of Normandy.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?
Dialogue:WARWICK=For grief that they are past recovery:

Dialogue:YORK=For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,
Dialogue:YORK=That dims the honour of this warlike isle!
Dialogue:YORK=France should have torn and rent my very heart,
Dialogue:YORK=Before I would have yielded to this league.
Dialogue:YORK=I never read but England's kings have had
Dialogue:YORK=Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:
Dialogue:YORK=And our King Henry gives away his own,
Dialogue:YORK=To match with her that brings no vantages.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=A proper jest, and never heard before,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=For costs and charges in transporting her!
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=She should have stayed in France and starved
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=in France, Before--

Dialogue:CARDINAL=So, there goes our protector in a rage.
Dialogue:CARDINAL='Tis known to you he is mine enemy,
Dialogue:CARDINAL=Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,
Dialogue:CARDINAL=And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.
Dialogue:CARDINAL=Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,
Dialogue:CARDINAL=And heir apparent to the English crown:
Dialogue:CARDINAL=Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,
Dialogue:CARDINAL=And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,
Dialogue:CARDINAL=There's reason he should be displeased at it.
Dialogue:CARDINAL=Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words
Dialogue:CARDINAL=Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.
Dialogue:CARDINAL=What though the common people favour him,
Dialogue:CARDINAL=Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of
Dialogue:CARDINAL=Gloucester,'
Dialogue:CARDINAL=Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,
Dialogue:CARDINAL='Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'
Dialogue:CARDINAL=With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'
Dialogue:CARDINAL=I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,
Dialogue:CARDINAL=He will be found a dangerous protector.
Dialogue:BUCKINGHAM=Why should he, then, protect our sovereign,
Dialogue:BUCKINGHAM=He being of age to govern of himself?

Dialogue:SOMERSET=His insolence is more intolerable
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Than all the princes in the land beside:
Dialogue:SOMERSET=If Gloucester be displaced, he'll be protector.
Dialogue:BUCKINGHAM=Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector,
Dialogue:BUCKINGHAM=Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.
Notice:Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Pride went before, ambition follows him.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=While these do labour for their own preferment,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Behoves it us to labour for the realm.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Did bear him like a noble gentleman.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=More like a soldier than a man o' the church,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=As stout and proud as he were lord of all,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Swear like a ruffian and demean himself
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:
Dialogue:SALISBURY=And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=In bringing them to civil discipline,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=When thou wert regent for our sovereign,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Join we together, for the public good,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=In what we can, to bridle and suppress
Dialogue:SALISBURY=The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;
Dialogue:SALISBURY=And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=While they do tend the profit of the land.
Dialogue:WARWICK=So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,
Dialogue:WARWICK=And common profit of his country!
Dialogue:YORK=[Aside]  And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main.
Dialogue:WARWICK=Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;
Dialogue:WARWICK=That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,
Dialogue:WARWICK=And would have kept so long as breath did last!
Dialogue:WARWICK=Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,
Dialogue:WARWICK=Which I will win from France, or else be slain,
Notice:Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY
Dialogue:YORK=Anjou and Maine are given to the French;
Dialogue:YORK=Paris is lost; the state of Normandy

Dialogue:YORK=Suffolk concluded on the articles,
Dialogue:YORK=The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased
Dialogue:YORK=To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.
Dialogue:YORK=I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?
Dialogue:YORK='Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
Dialogue:YORK=Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
Dialogue:YORK=And purchase friends and give to courtezans,

Dialogue:YORK=Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
Dialogue:YORK=And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,
Dialogue:YORK=While all is shared and all is borne away,
Dialogue:YORK=Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
Dialogue:YORK=So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,
Dialogue:YORK=While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.
Dialogue:YORK=Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland
Dialogue:YORK=Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
Dialogue:YORK=As did the fatal brand Althaea burn'd
Dialogue:YORK=Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.
Dialogue:YORK=Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
Dialogue:YORK=Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,
Dialogue:YORK=Even as I have of fertile England's soil.
Dialogue:YORK=A day will come when York shall claim his own;
Dialogue:YORK=And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts
Dialogue:YORK=And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,
Dialogue:YORK=And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,
Dialogue:YORK=For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:
Dialogue:YORK=Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,
Dialogue:YORK=Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
Dialogue:YORK=Nor wear the diadem upon his head,
Dialogue:YORK=Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.
Dialogue:YORK=Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:
Dialogue:YORK=Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,
Dialogue:YORK=To pry into the secrets of the state;
Dialogue:YORK=Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,
Dialogue:YORK=With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,
Dialogue:YORK=And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
Dialogue:YORK=Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,
Dialogue:YORK=With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;
Dialogue:YORK=And in my standard bear the arms of York
Dialogue:YORK=To grapple with the house of Lancaster;

Dialogue:DUCHESS=As frowning at the favours of the world?
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?

Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.
Dialogue:DUCHESS=What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite it
Dialogue:DUCHESS=With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=But, as I think, it was by the cardinal;
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And on the pieces of the broken wand
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Tut, this was nothing but an argument
Dialogue:DUCHESS=That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Shall lose his head for his presumption.
Dialogue:DUCHESS=But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Methought I sat in seat of majesty
Dialogue:DUCHESS=In the cathedral church of Westminster,
Dialogue:DUCHESS=And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd;
Dialogue:DUCHESS=Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me
Dialogue:DUCHESS=And on my head did set the diadem.

Notice:Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK
Dialogue:YORK=Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
Dialogue:YORK=Our simple supper ended, give me leave
Dialogue:YORK=In this close walk to satisfy myself,
Dialogue:YORK=In craving your opinion of my title,
Dialogue:YORK=Which is infallible, to England's crown.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=My lord, I long to hear it at full.
Dialogue:WARWICK=Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,
Dialogue:WARWICK=The Nevils are thy subjects to command.
Dialogue:YORK=Then thus:
Dialogue:YORK=Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
Dialogue:YORK=The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;
Dialogue:YORK=The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,
Dialogue:YORK=Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom
Dialogue:YORK=Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;
Dialogue:YORK=The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;
Dialogue:YORK=The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;
Dialogue:YORK=William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
Dialogue:YORK=Edward the Black Prince died before his father
Dialogue:YORK=And left behind him Richard, his only son,
Dialogue:YORK=Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;
Dialogue:YORK=Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,
Dialogue:YORK=The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
Dialogue:YORK=Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,
Dialogue:YORK=Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,
Dialogue:YORK=Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
Dialogue:YORK=And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,
Dialogue:YORK=Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.
Dialogue:WARWICK=Father, the duke hath told the truth:
Dialogue:WARWICK=Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.
Dialogue:YORK=Which now they hold by force and not by right;
Dialogue:YORK=For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,
Dialogue:YORK=The issue of the next son should have reign'd.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=But William of Hatfield died without an heir.
Dialogue:YORK=The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line
Dialogue:YORK=I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,
Dialogue:YORK=Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:
Dialogue:YORK=Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;
Dialogue:YORK=Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;
Dialogue:SALISBURY=And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Who kept him in captivity till he died.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=But to the rest.
Dialogue:YORK=       His eldest sister, Anne,
Dialogue:YORK=My mother, being heir unto the crown
Dialogue:YORK=Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son
Dialogue:YORK=To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.
Dialogue:YORK=By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
Dialogue:YORK=To Roger Earl of March, who was the son
Dialogue:YORK=Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,
Dialogue:YORK=Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:
Dialogue:YORK=So, if the issue of the elder son
Dialogue:YORK=Succeed before the younger, I am king.
Dialogue:WARWICK=What plain proceeding is more plain than this?
Dialogue:WARWICK=Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,
Dialogue:WARWICK=The fourth son; York claims it from the third.
Dialogue:WARWICK=Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:
Dialogue:WARWICK=It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee
Dialogue:WARWICK=And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.
Dialogue:WARWICK=Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;
Dialogue:WARWICK=And in this private plot be we the first
Dialogue:WARWICK=That shall salute our rightful sovereign
Dialogue:WARWICK=With honour of his birthright to the crown.
Dialogue:BOTH=Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!
Dialogue:YORK=We thank you, lords. But I am not your king
Dialogue:YORK=Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd
Dialogue:YORK=With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;
Dialogue:YORK=And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,
Dialogue:YORK=But with advice and silent secrecy.
Dialogue:YORK=Do you as I do in these dangerous days:
Dialogue:YORK=Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,
Dialogue:YORK=At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,
Dialogue:YORK=At Buckingham and all the crew of them,
Dialogue:YORK=Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,
Dialogue:YORK=That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:
Dialogue:YORK='Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that
Dialogue:YORK=Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.
Dialogue:WARWICK=My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
Dialogue:WARWICK=Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.
Dialogue:YORK=And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:
Dialogue:YORK=Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
Dialogue:YORK=The greatest man in England but the king.

Dialogue:QUEEN MARGARET=We know the time since he was mild and affable,
Dialogue:QUEEN MARGARET=And if we did but glance a far-off look,

Dialogue:SUFFOLK=And, had I first been put to speak my mind,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=I think I should have told your grace's tale.

Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.
Dialogue:CARDINAL=Did he not, contrary to form of law,
Dialogue:CARDINAL=Devise strange deaths for small offences done?

Dialogue:YORK=Levy great sums of money through the realm
Dialogue:YORK=For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?

Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=From meaning treason to our royal person
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=To dream on evil or to work my downfall.
Dialogue:QUEEN MARGARET=Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!
Dialogue:QUEEN MARGARET=Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,

Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=The purest spring is not so free from mud
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:

Dialogue:YORK=That England was defamed by tyranny.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=protector,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Pity was all the fault that was in me;
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=For I should melt at an offender's tears,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Unless it were a bloody murderer,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=I never gave them condign punishment:
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Above the felon or what trespass else.

Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Virtue is choked with foul ambition
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And charity chased hence by rancour's hand;
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Foul subornation is predominant
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And equity exiled your highness' land.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=I know their complot is to have my life,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And if my death might make this island happy,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And prove the period of their tyranny,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=I would expend it with all willingness:
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=But mine is made the prologue to their play;
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=The envious load that lies upon his heart;
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=By false accuse doth level at my life:
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=My liefest liege to be mine enemy:
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Ay, all you have laid your heads together--
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Myself had notice of your conventicles--
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And all to make away my guiltless life.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=I shall not want false witness to condemn me,

Dialogue:CARDINAL=Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at,
Dialogue:CARDINAL=And the offender granted scope of speech,
Dialogue:CARDINAL='Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=As if she had suborned some to swear
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=False allegations to o'erthrow his state?
Dialogue:QUEEN MARGARET=But I can give the loser leave to chide.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed;
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And well such losers may have leave to speak.
Dialogue:BUCKINGHAM=He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day:
Dialogue:BUCKINGHAM=Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner.
Dialogue:CARDINAL=Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Before his legs be firm to bear his body.
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,
Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.

Dialogue:GLOUCESTER=For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.

Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=My body round engirt with misery,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=For what's more miserable than discontent?
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=The map of honour, truth and loyalty:
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=What louring star now envies thy estate,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=That these great lords and Margaret our queen
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=And as the butcher takes away the calf
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=And as the dam runs lowing up and down,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Looking the way her harmless young one went,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=Look after him and cannot do him good,
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=So mighty are his vowed enemies.
Dialogue:KING HENRY VI=His fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groan

Dialogue:QUEEN MARGARET=Or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,
Dialogue:QUEEN MARGARET=With shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a child
Dialogue:QUEEN MARGARET=That for the beauty thinks it excellent.
Dialogue:QUEEN MARGARET=Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I--

Dialogue:CARDINAL=But yet we want a colour for his death:

Dialogue:SUFFOLK=The king will labour still to save his life,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=The commons haply rise, to save his life;
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=And yet we have but trivial argument,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.

Dialogue:SUFFOLK=To make the fox surveyor of the fold?
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Who being accused a crafty murderer,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=His guilt should be but idly posted over,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Because his purpose is not executed.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=By nature proved an enemy to the flock,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=So he be dead; for that is good deceit
Dialogue:SUFFOLK=Which mates him first that first intends deceit.

Dialogue:CARDINAL=What counsel give you in this weighty cause?
Dialogue:YORK=That Somerset be sent as regent thither:

Dialogue:SOMERSET=If York, with all his far-fet policy,
Dialogue:SOMERSET=Had been the regent there instead of me,
Dialogue:SOMERSET=He never would have stay'd in France so long.
Dialogue:YORK=No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:
Dialogue:YORK=I rather would have lost my life betimes
Dialogue:YORK=Than bring a burthen of dishonour home
Dialogue:YORK=By staying there so long till all were lost.

Dialogue:DICK=[Aside]  No question of that; for I have seen him

Dialogue:CADE=I fear neither sword nor fire.

Dialogue:CADE=like brothers and worship me their lord.
Dialogue:DICK=The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.
Dialogue:CADE=Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable
Dialogue:CADE=thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should
Dialogue:CADE=be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled
Dialogue:CADE=o'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings:
Dialogue:CADE=but I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but seal
Dialogue:CADE=once to a thing, and I was never mine own man
Dialogue:CADE=since. How now! who's there?

Dialogue:SIR HUMPHREY=Ay, sir.
Dialogue:CADE=By her he had two children at one birth.
Dialogue:WILLIAM STAFFORD=That's false.
Dialogue:CADE=Ay, there's the question; but I say, 'tis true:

Dialogue:CADE=Was by a beggar-woman stolen away;
Dialogue:CADE=And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,
Dialogue:CADE=Became a bricklayer when he came to age:

Dialogue:CADE=he shall reign; but I'll be protector over him.
Dialogue:DICK=And furthermore, well have the Lord Say's head for
Dialogue:DICK=selling the dukedom of Maine.
Dialogue:CADE=And good reason; for thereby is England mained, and
Dialogue:CADE=fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds
Dialogue:CADE=it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say
Dialogue:CADE=hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch:
Dialogue:CADE=and more than that, he can speak French; and
Dialogue:CADE=therefore he is a traitor.
Dialogue:SIR HUMPHREY=O gross and miserable ignorance!
Dialogue:CADE=Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are our
Dialogue:CADE=enemies; go to, then, I ask but this: can he that
Dialogue:CADE=speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good
Dialogue:CADE=counsellor, or no?
Dialogue:ALL=No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.
Dialogue:WILLIAM STAFFORD=Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,

Dialogue:CADE=paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou
Dialogue:CADE=hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and
Dialogue:CADE=a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian

Dialogue:CADE=Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and because
Dialogue:CADE=they could not read, thou hast hanged them; when,

Dialogue:CADE=on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to

Dialogue:CADE=while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach
Dialogue:CADE=this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'
Dialogue:CADE=was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a
Dialogue:CADE=sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown
Dialogue:CADE=bill; and many a time, when I have been dry and
Dialogue:CADE=bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a
Dialogue:CADE=quart pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'
