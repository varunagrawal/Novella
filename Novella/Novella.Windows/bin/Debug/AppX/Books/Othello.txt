Banner:SCENE I. Venice. A street.
Notice:Enter RODERIGO and IAGO
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly
Dialogue:RODERIGO=That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
Dialogue:RODERIGO=As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
Dialogue:IAGO='Sblood, but you will not hear me:
Dialogue:IAGO=If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
Dialogue:IAGO=Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
Dialogue:IAGO=In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
Dialogue:IAGO=Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,
Dialogue:IAGO=I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
Dialogue:IAGO=But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,
Dialogue:IAGO=Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
Dialogue:IAGO=Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
Dialogue:IAGO=And, in conclusion,
Dialogue:IAGO=Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
Dialogue:IAGO='I have already chose my officer.'
Dialogue:IAGO=And what was he?
Dialogue:IAGO=Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
Dialogue:IAGO=One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
Dialogue:IAGO=A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
Dialogue:IAGO=That never set a squadron in the field,
Dialogue:IAGO=Nor the division of a battle knows
Dialogue:IAGO=More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
Dialogue:IAGO=Wherein the toged consuls can propose
Dialogue:IAGO=As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
Dialogue:IAGO=Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
Dialogue:IAGO=And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
Dialogue:IAGO=At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
Dialogue:IAGO=Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd
Dialogue:IAGO=By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
Dialogue:IAGO=He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
Dialogue:IAGO=And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
Dialogue:IAGO=Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,
Dialogue:IAGO=Preferment goes by letter and affection,
Dialogue:IAGO=And not by old gradation, where each second
Dialogue:IAGO=Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,
Dialogue:IAGO=Whether I in any just term am affined
Dialogue:IAGO=To love the Moor.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=I would not follow him then.
Dialogue:IAGO=O, sir, content you;
Dialogue:IAGO=I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
Dialogue:IAGO=We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
Dialogue:IAGO=Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
Dialogue:IAGO=Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
Dialogue:IAGO=That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
Dialogue:IAGO=Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
Dialogue:IAGO=For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:
Dialogue:IAGO=Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
Dialogue:IAGO=Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
Dialogue:IAGO=Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
Dialogue:IAGO=And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
Dialogue:IAGO=Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
Dialogue:IAGO=their coats
Dialogue:IAGO=Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
Dialogue:IAGO=And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
Dialogue:IAGO=It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
Dialogue:IAGO=Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
Dialogue:IAGO=In following him, I follow but myself;
Dialogue:IAGO=Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
Dialogue:IAGO=But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
Dialogue:IAGO=For when my outward action doth demonstrate
Dialogue:IAGO=The native act and figure of my heart
Dialogue:IAGO=In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
Dialogue:IAGO=But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
Dialogue:IAGO=For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=What a full fortune does the thicklips owe
Dialogue:RODERIGO=If he can carry't thus!
Dialogue:IAGO=Call up her father,
Dialogue:IAGO=Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,
Dialogue:IAGO=Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,
Dialogue:IAGO=And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
Dialogue:IAGO=Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
Dialogue:IAGO=Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,
Dialogue:IAGO=As it may lose some colour.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
Dialogue:IAGO=Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
Dialogue:IAGO=As when, by night and negligence, the fire
Dialogue:IAGO=Is spied in populous cities.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
Dialogue:IAGO=Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!
Dialogue:IAGO=Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!
Dialogue:IAGO=Thieves! thieves!
Notice:BRABANTIO appears above, at a window
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=What is the reason of this terrible summons?
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=What is the matter there?
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Signior, is all your family within?
Dialogue:IAGO=Are your doors lock'd?
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Why, wherefore ask you this?
Dialogue:IAGO='Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on
Dialogue:IAGO=your gown;
Dialogue:IAGO=Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
Dialogue:IAGO=Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
Dialogue:IAGO=Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;
Dialogue:IAGO=Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
Dialogue:IAGO=Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
Dialogue:IAGO=Arise, I say.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=                  What, have you lost your wits?
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Not I	what are you?
Dialogue:RODERIGO=My name is Roderigo.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=The worser welcome:
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=To start my quiet.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Sir, sir, sir,--
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=                  But thou must needs be sure
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=My spirit and my place have in them power
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=To make this bitter to thee.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Patience, good sir.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=My house is not a grange.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Most grave Brabantio,
Dialogue:RODERIGO=In simple and pure soul I come to you.
Dialogue:IAGO='Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not
Dialogue:IAGO=serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to
Dialogue:IAGO=do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll
Dialogue:IAGO=have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;
Dialogue:IAGO=you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
Dialogue:IAGO=coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=What profane wretch art thou?
Dialogue:IAGO=I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter
Dialogue:IAGO=and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Thou art a villain.
Dialogue:IAGO=You are--a senator.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
Dialogue:RODERIGO=If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
Dialogue:RODERIGO=As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
Dialogue:RODERIGO=At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Transported, with no worse nor better guard
Dialogue:RODERIGO=But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
Dialogue:RODERIGO=To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--
Dialogue:RODERIGO=If this be known to you and your allowance,
Dialogue:RODERIGO=We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
Dialogue:RODERIGO=But if you know not this, my manners tell me
Dialogue:RODERIGO=We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
Dialogue:RODERIGO=That, from the sense of all civility,
Dialogue:RODERIGO=I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
Dialogue:RODERIGO=I say again, hath made a gross revolt;
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
Dialogue:RODERIGO=In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
Dialogue:RODERIGO=If she be in her chamber or your house,
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Let loose on me the justice of the state
Dialogue:RODERIGO=For thus deluding you.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Strike on the tinder, ho!
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Give me a taper! call up all my people!
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=This accident is not unlike my dream:
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Belief of it oppresses me already.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Light, I say! light!
Notice:Exit above
Dialogue:IAGO=Farewell; for I must leave you:
Dialogue:IAGO=It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
Dialogue:IAGO=To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--
Dialogue:IAGO=Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,
Dialogue:IAGO=However this may gall him with some cheque,
Dialogue:IAGO=Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
Dialogue:IAGO=With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
Dialogue:IAGO=Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,
Dialogue:IAGO=Another of his fathom they have none,
Dialogue:IAGO=To lead their business: in which regard,
Dialogue:IAGO=Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.
Dialogue:IAGO=Yet, for necessity of present life,
Dialogue:IAGO=I must show out a flag and sign of love,
Dialogue:IAGO=Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
Dialogue:IAGO=Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
Dialogue:IAGO=And there will I be with him. So, farewell.
Notice:Exit
Notice:Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=It is too true an evil: gone she is;
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=And what's to come of my despised time
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Truly, I think they are.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=By what you see them act. Is there not charms
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=By which the property of youth and maidhood
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Of some such thing?
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Yes, sir, I have indeed.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Some one way, some another. Do you know
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
Dialogue:RODERIGO=I think I can discover him, if you please,
Dialogue:RODERIGO=To get good guard and go along with me.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=And raise some special officers of night.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.

Dialogue:IAGO=To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity
Dialogue:IAGO=Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
Dialogue:IAGO=I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.
Dialogue:OTHELLO='Tis better as it is.
Dialogue:IAGO=Nay, but he prated,
Dialogue:IAGO=And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
Dialogue:IAGO=Against your honour
Dialogue:IAGO=That, with the little godliness I have,
Dialogue:IAGO=I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,
Dialogue:IAGO=Are you fast married? Be assured of this,
Dialogue:IAGO=That the magnifico is much beloved,
Dialogue:IAGO=And hath in his effect a voice potential
Dialogue:IAGO=As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;
Dialogue:IAGO=Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
Dialogue:IAGO=The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
Dialogue:IAGO=Will give him cable.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Let him do his spite:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=My services which I have done the signiory
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being
Dialogue:OTHELLO=From men of royal siege, and my demerits
Dialogue:OTHELLO=May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
Dialogue:OTHELLO=As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I would not my unhoused free condition
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Put into circumscription and confine
Dialogue:OTHELLO=For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?
Dialogue:IAGO=Those are the raised father and his friends:
Dialogue:IAGO=You were best go in.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Not I	I must be found:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=My parts, my title and my perfect soul
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?
Dialogue:IAGO=By Janus, I think no.
Notice:Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches

Dialogue:OTHELLO=What is the news?
Dialogue:CASSIO=                  The duke does greet you, general,
Dialogue:CASSIO=And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
Dialogue:CASSIO=Even on the instant.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=What is the matter, think you?
Dialogue:CASSIO=Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
Dialogue:CASSIO=It is a business of some heat: the galleys
Dialogue:CASSIO=Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
Dialogue:CASSIO=This very night at one another's heels,
Dialogue:CASSIO=And many of the consuls, raised and met,
Dialogue:CASSIO=Are at the duke's already: you have been
Dialogue:CASSIO=hotly call'd for;
Dialogue:CASSIO=When, being not at your lodging to be found,
Dialogue:CASSIO=The senate hath sent about three several guests
Dialogue:CASSIO=To search you out.

Dialogue:OTHELLO=And go with you.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:CASSIO=                  Ancient, what makes he here?

Dialogue:CASSIO=I do not understand.
Dialogue:IAGO=He's married.
Dialogue:CASSIO=To who?
Notice:Re-enter OTHELLO

Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Down with him, thief!
Notice:They draw on both sides
Dialogue:IAGO=You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Good signior, you shall more command with years
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Than with your weapons.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=If she in chains of magic were not bound,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=So opposite to marriage that she shunned
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;
Dialogue:BRABANTIO='Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=For an abuser of the world, a practiser
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Subdue him at his peril.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Hold your hands,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Both you of my inclining, and the rest:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Without a prompter. Where will you that I go
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To answer this your charge?
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=To prison, till fit time
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Of law and course of direct session
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Call thee to answer.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=What if I do obey?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=How may the duke be therewith satisfied,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Whose messengers are here about my side,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Upon some present business of the state
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To bring me to him?
Dialogue:First Officer='Tis true, most worthy signior;
Dialogue:First Officer=The duke's in council and your noble self,
Dialogue:First Officer=I am sure, is sent for.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=How! the duke in council!
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=In this time of the night! Bring him away:
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Or any of my brothers of the state,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=For if such actions may have passage free,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
Notice:Exeunt
Banner:SCENE III. A council-chamber.
Notice:The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=There is no composition in these news
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=That gives them credit.
Dialogue:First Senator=Indeed, they are disproportion'd;
Dialogue:First Senator=My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=And mine, a hundred and forty.
Dialogue:Second Senator=And mine, two hundred:
Dialogue:Second Senator=But though they jump not on a just account,--
Dialogue:Second Senator=As in these cases, where the aim reports,
Dialogue:Second Senator='Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm
Dialogue:Second Senator=A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=I do not so secure me in the error,
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=But the main article I do approve
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=In fearful sense.
Dialogue:Sailor=[Within]  What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!
Dialogue:First Officer=A messenger from the galleys.
Notice:Enter a Sailor
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Now, what's the business?
Dialogue:Sailor=The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;
Dialogue:Sailor=So was I bid report here to the state
Dialogue:Sailor=By Signior Angelo.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=How say you by this change?
Dialogue:First Senator=This cannot be,
Dialogue:First Senator=By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,
Dialogue:First Senator=To keep us in false gaze. When we consider
Dialogue:First Senator=The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,
Dialogue:First Senator=And let ourselves again but understand,
Dialogue:First Senator=That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
Dialogue:First Senator=So may he with more facile question bear it,
Dialogue:First Senator=For that it stands not in such warlike brace,
Dialogue:First Senator=But altogether lacks the abilities
Dialogue:First Senator=That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,
Dialogue:First Senator=We must not think the Turk is so unskilful
Dialogue:First Senator=To leave that latest which concerns him first,
Dialogue:First Senator=Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
Dialogue:First Senator=To wake and wage a danger profitless.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
Dialogue:First Officer=Here is more news.
Notice:Enter a Messenger
Dialogue:Messenger=The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,
Dialogue:Messenger=Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,
Dialogue:Messenger=Have there injointed them with an after fleet.
Dialogue:First Senator=Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?
Dialogue:Messenger=Of thirty sail: and now they do restem
Dialogue:Messenger=Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
Dialogue:Messenger=Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,
Dialogue:Messenger=Your trusty and most valiant servitor,
Dialogue:Messenger=With his free duty recommends you thus,
Dialogue:Messenger=And prays you to believe him.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE='Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?
Dialogue:First Senator=He's now in Florence.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.
Dialogue:First Senator=Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
Notice:Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Against the general enemy Ottoman.
Notice:To BRABANTIO
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Take hold on me, for my particular grief
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=And it is still itself.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Why, what's the matter?
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=My daughter! O, my daughter!
Dialogue:Senator=Dead?
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Ay, to me;
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=For nature so preposterously to err,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Sans witchcraft could not.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=And you of her, the bloody book of law
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Stood in your action.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Humbly I thank your grace.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Your special mandate for the state-affairs
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Hath hither brought.
Dialogue:Senator=We are very sorry for't.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=[To OTHELLO]  What, in your own part, can you say to this?
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Nothing, but this is so.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=My very noble and approved good masters,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=It is most true; true, I have married her:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=The very head and front of my offending
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Their dearest action in the tented field,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And little of this great world can I speak,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And therefore little shall I grace my cause
Dialogue:OTHELLO=In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=What conjuration and what mighty magic,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=For such proceeding I am charged withal,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I won his daughter.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=A maiden never bold;
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=That will confess perfection so could err
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=To find out practises of cunning hell,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Why this should be. I therefore vouch again
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=He wrought upon her.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=To vouch this, is no proof,
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Without more wider and more overt test
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
Dialogue:First Senator=But, Othello, speak:
Dialogue:First Senator=Did you by indirect and forced courses
Dialogue:First Senator=Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
Dialogue:First Senator=Or came it by request and such fair question
Dialogue:First Senator=As soul to soul affordeth?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I do beseech you,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And let her speak of me before her father:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=If you do find me foul in her report,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=The trust, the office I do hold of you,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Not only take away, but let your sentence
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Even fall upon my life.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Fetch Desdemona hither.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.
Notice:Exeunt IAGO and Attendants
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And, till she come, as truly as to heaven
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I do confess the vices of my blood,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=So justly to your grave ears I'll present
Dialogue:OTHELLO=How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And she in mine.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Say it, Othello.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Her father loved me; oft invited me;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Still question'd me the story of my life,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=That I have passed.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Of moving accidents by flood and field
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Of being taken by the insolent foe
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And portance in my travels' history:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
Dialogue:OTHELLO=It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Would Desdemona seriously incline:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Devour up my discourse: which I observing,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
Dialogue:OTHELLO=That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=But not intentively: I did consent,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And often did beguile her of her tears,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=When I did speak of some distressful stroke
Dialogue:OTHELLO=That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
Dialogue:OTHELLO='Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
Dialogue:OTHELLO=That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I should but teach him how to tell my story.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And I loved her that she did pity them.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=This only is the witchcraft I have used:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
Notice:Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=I think this tale would win my daughter too.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Good Brabantio,
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Take up this mangled matter at the best:
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Men do their broken weapons rather use
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Than their bare hands.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=I pray you, hear her speak:
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=If she confess that she was half the wooer,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Do you perceive in all this noble company
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Where most you owe obedience?
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=My noble father,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=I do perceive here a divided duty:
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=To you I am bound for life and education;
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=My life and education both do learn me
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=And so much duty as my mother show'd
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=To you, preferring you before her father,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=So much I challenge that I may profess
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Due to the Moor my lord.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=God be wi' you! I have done.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Come hither, Moor:
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=I here do give thee that with all my heart
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=I am glad at soul I have no other child:
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Into your favour.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Patience her injury a mockery makes.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=We lose it not, so long as we can smile.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=But words are words; I never yet did hear
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=known to you; and though we have there a substitute
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=voice on you: you must therefore be content to
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=more stubborn and boisterous expedition.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
Dialogue:OTHELLO=My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise
Dialogue:OTHELLO=A natural and prompt alacrity
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I find in hardness, and do undertake
Dialogue:OTHELLO=These present wars against the Ottomites.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I crave fit disposition for my wife.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Due reference of place and exhibition,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=With such accommodation and besort
Dialogue:OTHELLO=As levels with her breeding.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=If you please,
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Be't at her father's.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=I'll not have it so.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Nor I.
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=     Nor I; I would not there reside,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=To put my father in impatient thoughts
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=And let me find a charter in your voice,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=To assist my simpleness.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=What would You, Desdemona?
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=That I did love the Moor to live with him,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=My downright violence and storm of fortunes
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Even to the very quality of my lord:
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=And to his honour and his valiant parts
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=And I a heavy interim shall support
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=By his dear absence. Let me go with him.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Let her have your voices.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To please the palate of my appetite,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
Dialogue:OTHELLO=In me defunct--and proper satisfaction.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=But to be free and bounteous to her mind:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And heaven defend your good souls, that you think
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I will your serious and great business scant
Dialogue:OTHELLO=For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness
Dialogue:OTHELLO=My speculative and officed instruments,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And all indign and base adversities
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Make head against my estimation!
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Be it as you shall privately determine,
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=And speed must answer it.
Dialogue:First Senator=You must away to-night.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=With all my heart.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Othello, leave some officer behind,
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=And he shall our commission bring to you;
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=With such things else of quality and respect
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=As doth import you.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=So please your grace, my ancient;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=A man he is of honest and trust:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To his conveyance I assign my wife,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=With what else needful your good grace shall think
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To be sent after me.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Let it be so.
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Good night to every one.
Notice:To BRABANTIO
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=And, noble signior,
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
Dialogue:DUKE OF VENICE=Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
Dialogue:First Senator=Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:
Dialogue:BRABANTIO=She has deceived her father, and may thee.
Notice: c
Dialogue:OTHELLO=My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=My Desdemona must I leave to thee:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And bring them after in the best advantage.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Of love, of worldly matters and direction,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To spend with thee: we must obey the time.

Dialogue:RODERIGO=Iago,--
Dialogue:IAGO=What say'st thou, noble heart?
Dialogue:RODERIGO=What will I do, thinkest thou?
Dialogue:IAGO=Why, go to bed, and sleep.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=I will incontinently drown myself.
Dialogue:IAGO=If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,
Dialogue:IAGO=thou silly gentleman!
Dialogue:RODERIGO=It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and
Dialogue:RODERIGO=then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
Dialogue:IAGO=O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four
Dialogue:IAGO=times seven years; and since I could distinguish
Dialogue:IAGO=betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man
Dialogue:IAGO=that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I
Dialogue:IAGO=would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I
Dialogue:IAGO=would change my humanity with a baboon.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so
Dialogue:RODERIGO=fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.
Dialogue:IAGO=Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
Dialogue:IAGO=or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
Dialogue:IAGO=our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
Dialogue:IAGO=nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up
Dialogue:IAGO=thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
Dialogue:IAGO=distract it with many, either to have it sterile
Dialogue:IAGO=with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
Dialogue:IAGO=power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
Dialogue:IAGO=wills. If the balance of our lives had not one
Dialogue:IAGO=scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the
Dialogue:IAGO=blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
Dialogue:IAGO=to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
Dialogue:IAGO=reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal
Dialogue:IAGO=stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that
Dialogue:IAGO=you call love to be a sect or scion.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=It cannot be.
Dialogue:IAGO=It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
Dialogue:IAGO=the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown
Dialogue:IAGO=cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy
Dialogue:IAGO=friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
Dialogue:IAGO=cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
Dialogue:IAGO=better stead thee than now. Put money in thy
Dialogue:IAGO=purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with
Dialogue:IAGO=an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It
Dialogue:IAGO=cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her
Dialogue:IAGO=love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he
Dialogue:IAGO=his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou
Dialogue:IAGO=shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but
Dialogue:IAGO=money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in
Dialogue:IAGO=their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
Dialogue:IAGO=that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be
Dialogue:IAGO=to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must
Dialogue:IAGO=change for youth: when she is sated with his body,
Dialogue:IAGO=she will find the error of her choice: she must
Dialogue:IAGO=have change, she must: therefore put money in thy
Dialogue:IAGO=purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a
Dialogue:IAGO=more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money
Dialogue:IAGO=thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
Dialogue:IAGO=an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not
Dialogue:IAGO=too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou
Dialogue:IAGO=shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of
Dialogue:IAGO=drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek
Dialogue:IAGO=thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
Dialogue:IAGO=to be drowned and go without her.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
Dialogue:RODERIGO=the issue?
Dialogue:IAGO=Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told
Dialogue:IAGO=thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I
Dialogue:IAGO=hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no
Dialogue:IAGO=less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
Dialogue:IAGO=against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost
Dialogue:IAGO=thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many
Dialogue:IAGO=events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
Dialogue:IAGO=Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more
Dialogue:IAGO=of this to-morrow. Adieu.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Where shall we meet i' the morning?
Dialogue:IAGO=At my lodging.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=I'll be with thee betimes.
Dialogue:IAGO=Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
Dialogue:RODERIGO=What say you?
Dialogue:IAGO=No more of drowning, do you hear?
Dialogue:RODERIGO=I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.

Dialogue:IAGO=Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:
Dialogue:IAGO=For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,
Dialogue:IAGO=If I would time expend with such a snipe.
Dialogue:IAGO=But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:
Dialogue:IAGO=And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
Dialogue:IAGO=He has done my office: I know not if't be true;
Dialogue:IAGO=But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
Dialogue:IAGO=Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;
Dialogue:IAGO=The better shall my purpose work on him.
Dialogue:IAGO=Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:
Dialogue:IAGO=To get his place and to plume up my will
Dialogue:IAGO=In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--
Dialogue:IAGO=After some time, to abuse Othello's ear
Dialogue:IAGO=That he is too familiar with his wife.
Dialogue:IAGO=He hath a person and a smooth dispose
Dialogue:IAGO=To be suspected, framed to make women false.
Dialogue:IAGO=The Moor is of a free and open nature,
Dialogue:IAGO=That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
Dialogue:IAGO=And will as tenderly be led by the nose
Dialogue:IAGO=As asses are.
Dialogue:IAGO=I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night
Dialogue:IAGO=Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.

Dialogue:MONTANO=Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
Dialogue:MONTANO=A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:
Dialogue:MONTANO=If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,
Dialogue:MONTANO=What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
Dialogue:MONTANO=Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=A segregation of the Turkish fleet:
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=seems to cast water on the burning bear,

Dialogue:Second Gentleman=I never did like molestation view
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=On the enchafed flood.

Dialogue:Third Gentleman=On most part of their fleet.

Dialogue:Third Gentleman=Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=With foul and violent tempest.

Dialogue:MONTANO=Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!

Dialogue:IAGO=[Aside]  He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,
Dialogue:IAGO=whisper: with as little a web as this will I
Dialogue:IAGO=ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon
Dialogue:IAGO=her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.
Dialogue:IAGO=You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as
Dialogue:IAGO=these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had
Dialogue:IAGO=been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
Dialogue:IAGO=oft, which now again you are most apt to play the
Dialogue:IAGO=sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent
Dialogue:IAGO=courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers
Dialogue:IAGO=to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!

Dialogue:OTHELLO=To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=If after every tempest come such calms,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Olympus-high and duck again as low
Dialogue:OTHELLO=As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,
Dialogue:OTHELLO='Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=My soul hath her content so absolute
Dialogue:OTHELLO=That not another comfort like to this
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Succeeds in unknown fate.
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=The heavens forbid
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=But that our loves and comforts should increase,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Even as our days do grow!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Amen to that, sweet powers!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I cannot speak enough of this content;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And this, and this, the greatest discords be
Notice:Kissing her
Dialogue:OTHELLO=That e'er our hearts shall make!
Dialogue:IAGO=[Aside]  O, you are well tuned now!
Dialogue:IAGO=But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,

Dialogue:OTHELLO=                  Come, let us to the castle.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks
Dialogue:OTHELLO=are drown'd.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
Dialogue:OTHELLO=In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Bring thou the master to the citadel;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=He is a good one, and his worthiness
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Once more, well met at Cyprus.
Notice:Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants
Dialogue:IAGO=Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come
Dialogue:IAGO=hither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base
Dialogue:IAGO=men being in love have then a nobility in their
Dialogue:IAGO=natures more than is native to them--list me. The
Dialogue:IAGO=lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
Dialogue:IAGO=guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is
Dialogue:IAGO=directly in love with him.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=With him! why, 'tis not possible.
Dialogue:IAGO=Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
Dialogue:IAGO=Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,
Dialogue:IAGO=but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
Dialogue:IAGO=and will she love him still for prating? let not
Dialogue:IAGO=thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
Dialogue:IAGO=and what delight shall she have to look on the
Dialogue:IAGO=devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
Dialogue:IAGO=sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to
Dialogue:IAGO=give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
Dialogue:IAGO=sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
Dialogue:IAGO=the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
Dialogue:IAGO=required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will
Dialogue:IAGO=find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
Dialogue:IAGO=disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
Dialogue:IAGO=instruct her in it and compel her to some second
Dialogue:IAGO=choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most
Dialogue:IAGO=pregnant and unforced position--who stands so
Dialogue:IAGO=eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
Dialogue:IAGO=does? a knave very voluble; no further
Dialogue:IAGO=conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
Dialogue:IAGO=civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
Dialogue:IAGO=of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,
Dialogue:IAGO=none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
Dialogue:IAGO=finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
Dialogue:IAGO=counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
Dialogue:IAGO=present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
Dialogue:IAGO=knave is handsome, young, and hath all those
Dialogue:IAGO=requisites in him that folly and green minds look
Dialogue:IAGO=after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
Dialogue:IAGO=hath found him already.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=I cannot believe that in her; she's full of
Dialogue:RODERIGO=most blessed condition.
Dialogue:IAGO=Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of
Dialogue:IAGO=grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never
Dialogue:IAGO=have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou
Dialogue:IAGO=not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst
Dialogue:IAGO=not mark that?
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.
Dialogue:IAGO=Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue
Dialogue:IAGO=to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met
Dialogue:IAGO=so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
Dialogue:IAGO=together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these
Dialogue:IAGO=mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes
Dialogue:IAGO=the master and main exercise, the incorporate
Dialogue:IAGO=conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I
Dialogue:IAGO=have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
Dialogue:IAGO=for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows
Dialogue:IAGO=you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find
Dialogue:IAGO=some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking
Dialogue:IAGO=too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what
Dialogue:IAGO=other course you please, which the time shall more
Dialogue:IAGO=favourably minister.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Well.
Dialogue:IAGO=Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply
Dialogue:IAGO=may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for
Dialogue:IAGO=even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
Dialogue:IAGO=mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true
Dialogue:IAGO=taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So
Dialogue:IAGO=shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
Dialogue:IAGO=the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the
Dialogue:IAGO=impediment most profitably removed, without the
Dialogue:IAGO=which there were no expectation of our prosperity.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=I will do this, if I can bring it to any
Dialogue:RODERIGO=opportunity.
Dialogue:IAGO=I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:
Dialogue:IAGO=I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=Adieu.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:IAGO=That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
Dialogue:IAGO=That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:
Dialogue:IAGO=The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
Dialogue:IAGO=Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
Dialogue:IAGO=And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
Dialogue:IAGO=A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
Dialogue:IAGO=Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
Dialogue:IAGO=I stand accountant for as great a sin,
Dialogue:IAGO=But partly led to diet my revenge,
Dialogue:IAGO=For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
Dialogue:IAGO=Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
Dialogue:IAGO=Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;
Dialogue:IAGO=And nothing can or shall content my soul
Dialogue:IAGO=Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,
Dialogue:IAGO=Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
Dialogue:IAGO=At least into a jealousy so strong
Dialogue:IAGO=That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
Dialogue:IAGO=If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
Dialogue:IAGO=For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
Dialogue:IAGO=I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
Dialogue:IAGO=Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--
Dialogue:IAGO=For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--
Dialogue:IAGO=Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.
Dialogue:IAGO=For making him egregiously an ass
Dialogue:IAGO=And practising upon his peace and quiet
Dialogue:IAGO=Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:

Dialogue:IAGO=he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and
Dialogue:IAGO=she is sport for Jove.
Dialogue:CASSIO=She's a most exquisite lady.
Dialogue:IAGO=And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.
Dialogue:CASSIO=Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.
Dialogue:IAGO=What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of
Dialogue:IAGO=provocation.
Dialogue:CASSIO=An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
Dialogue:IAGO=And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
Dialogue:CASSIO=She is indeed perfection.
Dialogue:IAGO=Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I

Dialogue:IAGO=of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
Dialogue:IAGO=the health of black Othello.

Dialogue:CASSIO=courtesy would invent some other custom of
Dialogue:CASSIO=entertainment.
Dialogue:IAGO=O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for
Dialogue:IAGO=you.
Dialogue:CASSIO=I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was

Dialogue:CASSIO=I know not.
Dialogue:IAGO=Is't possible?
Dialogue:CASSIO=I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;
Dialogue:CASSIO=a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men
Dialogue:CASSIO=should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
Dialogue:CASSIO=their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance
Dialogue:CASSIO=revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!
Dialogue:IAGO=Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus
Dialogue:IAGO=recovered?
Dialogue:CASSIO=It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
Dialogue:CASSIO=to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me
Dialogue:CASSIO=another, to make me frankly despise myself.
Dialogue:IAGO=Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,
Dialogue:IAGO=the place, and the condition of this country
Dialogue:IAGO=stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;
Dialogue:IAGO=but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.
Dialogue:CASSIO=I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me
Dialogue:CASSIO=I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,
Dialogue:CASSIO=such an answer would stop them all. To be now a
Dialogue:CASSIO=sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
Dialogue:CASSIO=beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is
Dialogue:CASSIO=unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.
Dialogue:IAGO=Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,
Dialogue:IAGO=if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.
Dialogue:IAGO=And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.
Dialogue:CASSIO=I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!
Dialogue:IAGO=You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.
Dialogue:IAGO=I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife
Dialogue:IAGO=is now the general: may say so in this respect, for
Dialogue:IAGO=that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
Dialogue:IAGO=contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and
Dialogue:IAGO=graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune
Dialogue:IAGO=her help to put you in your place again: she is of
Dialogue:IAGO=so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
Dialogue:IAGO=she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
Dialogue:IAGO=than she is requested: this broken joint between
Dialogue:IAGO=you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my
Dialogue:IAGO=fortunes against any lay worth naming, this
Dialogue:IAGO=crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
Dialogue:CASSIO=You advise me well.
Dialogue:IAGO=I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
Dialogue:CASSIO=I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
Dialogue:CASSIO=beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
Dialogue:CASSIO=I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.
Dialogue:IAGO=You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I
Dialogue:IAGO=must to the watch.
Dialogue:IAGO=CASSIO: Good night, honest Iago.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:IAGO=And what's he then that says I play the villain?
Dialogue:IAGO=When this advice is free I give and honest,
Dialogue:IAGO=Probal to thinking and indeed the course
Dialogue:IAGO=To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
Dialogue:IAGO=The inclining Desdemona to subdue
Dialogue:IAGO=In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful
Dialogue:IAGO=As the free elements. And then for her
Dialogue:IAGO=To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,
Dialogue:IAGO=All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
Dialogue:IAGO=His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
Dialogue:IAGO=That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
Dialogue:IAGO=Even as her appetite shall play the god
Dialogue:IAGO=With his weak function. How am I then a villain
Dialogue:IAGO=To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
Dialogue:IAGO=Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
Dialogue:IAGO=When devils will the blackest sins put on,
Dialogue:IAGO=They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
Dialogue:IAGO=As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
Dialogue:IAGO=Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
Dialogue:IAGO=And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
Dialogue:IAGO=I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
Dialogue:IAGO=That she repeals him for her body's lust;
Dialogue:IAGO=And by how much she strives to do him good,
Dialogue:IAGO=She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
Dialogue:IAGO=So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
Dialogue:IAGO=And out of her own goodness make the net
Dialogue:IAGO=That shall enmesh them all.
Notice:Re-enter RODERIGO
Dialogue:IAGO=How now, Roderigo!
Dialogue:RODERIGO=I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that
Dialogue:RODERIGO=hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is
Dialogue:RODERIGO=almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well
Dialogue:RODERIGO=cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall
Dialogue:RODERIGO=have so much experience for my pains, and so, with
Dialogue:RODERIGO=no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.
Dialogue:IAGO=How poor are they that have not patience!
Dialogue:IAGO=What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Dialogue:IAGO=Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;
Dialogue:IAGO=And wit depends on dilatory time.
Dialogue:IAGO=Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.
Dialogue:IAGO=And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:
Dialogue:IAGO=Though other things grow fair against the sun,
Dialogue:IAGO=Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
Dialogue:IAGO=Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
Dialogue:IAGO=Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
Dialogue:IAGO=Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
Dialogue:IAGO=Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:
Dialogue:IAGO=Nay, get thee gone.
Notice:Exit RODERIGO
Dialogue:IAGO=Two things are to be done:
Dialogue:IAGO=My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
Dialogue:IAGO=I'll set her on;
Dialogue:IAGO=Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
Dialogue:IAGO=And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
Dialogue:IAGO=Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way
Dialogue:IAGO=Dull not device by coldness and delay.

Dialogue:Clown=But, masters, here's money for you: and the general
Dialogue:Clown=so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's
Dialogue:Clown=sake, to make no more noise with it.
Dialogue:First Musician=Well, sir, we will not.

Dialogue:EMILIA=That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,
Dialogue:EMILIA=And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom
Dialogue:EMILIA=He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
Dialogue:EMILIA=And needs no other suitor but his likings

Dialogue:EMILIA=As if the case were his.
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,

Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=If I have any grace or power to move you,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=His present reconciliation take;
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=For if he be not one that truly loves you,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,

Dialogue:DESDEMONA=I prithee, call him back.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Went he hence now?
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Ay, sooth; so humbled
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=That he hath left part of his grief with me,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.

Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Shall't be to-night at supper?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=No, not to-night.
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=To-morrow dinner, then?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I shall not dine at home;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I meet the captains at the citadel.
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=I prithee, name the time, but let it not
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=And yet his trespass, in our common reason--
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Out of their best--is not almost a fault
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=What you would ask me, that I should deny,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I will deny thee nothing.
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Why, this is not a boon;
Dialogue:DESDEMONA='Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=And fearful to be granted.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I will deny thee nothing:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To leave me but a little to myself.
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.

Dialogue:IAGO=My noble lord--
Dialogue:OTHELLO=                  What dost thou say, Iago?
Dialogue:IAGO=Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
Dialogue:IAGO=Know of your love?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
Dialogue:IAGO=But for a satisfaction of my thought;
Dialogue:IAGO=No further harm.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=                  Why of thy thought, Iago?
Dialogue:IAGO=I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=O, yes; and went between us very oft.
Dialogue:IAGO=Indeed!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Is he not honest?
Dialogue:IAGO=Honest, my lord!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=                  Honest! ay, honest.
Dialogue:IAGO=My lord, for aught I know.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=What dost thou think?
Dialogue:IAGO=Think, my lord!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Think, my lord!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=By heaven, he echoes me,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=As if there were some monster in his thought
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And when I told thee he was of my counsel
Dialogue:OTHELLO=In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Show me thy thought.
Dialogue:IAGO=My lord, you know I love you.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I think thou dost;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=For such things in a false disloyal knave
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just
Dialogue:OTHELLO=They are close delations, working from the heart
Dialogue:OTHELLO=That passion cannot rule.
Dialogue:IAGO=For Michael Cassio,
Dialogue:IAGO=I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I think so too.
Dialogue:IAGO=                  Men should be what they seem;
Dialogue:IAGO=Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Certain, men should be what they seem.
Dialogue:IAGO=Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Nay, yet there's more in this:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
Dialogue:OTHELLO=The worst of words.
Dialogue:IAGO=Good my lord, pardon me:
Dialogue:IAGO=Though I am bound to every act of duty,
Dialogue:IAGO=I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
Dialogue:IAGO=Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
Dialogue:IAGO=As where's that palace whereinto foul things
Dialogue:IAGO=Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,
Dialogue:IAGO=But some uncleanly apprehensions
Dialogue:IAGO=Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
Dialogue:IAGO=With meditations lawful?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
Dialogue:OTHELLO=A stranger to thy thoughts.
Dialogue:IAGO=I do beseech you--
Dialogue:IAGO=Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
Dialogue:IAGO=As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
Dialogue:IAGO=To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
Dialogue:IAGO=Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,
Dialogue:IAGO=From one that so imperfectly conceits,
Dialogue:IAGO=Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
Dialogue:IAGO=Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
Dialogue:IAGO=It were not for your quiet nor your good,
Dialogue:IAGO=Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
Dialogue:IAGO=To let you know my thoughts.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=What dost thou mean?
Dialogue:IAGO=Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
Dialogue:IAGO=Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
Dialogue:IAGO=Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
Dialogue:IAGO='Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
Dialogue:IAGO=But he that filches from me my good name
Dialogue:IAGO=Robs me of that which not enriches him
Dialogue:IAGO=And makes me poor indeed.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
Dialogue:IAGO=You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
Dialogue:IAGO=Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Ha!
Dialogue:IAGO=O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
Dialogue:IAGO=It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
Dialogue:IAGO=The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
Dialogue:IAGO=Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
Dialogue:IAGO=But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
Dialogue:IAGO=Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=O misery!
Dialogue:IAGO=Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
Dialogue:IAGO=But riches fineless is as poor as winter
Dialogue:IAGO=To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
Dialogue:IAGO=Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
Dialogue:IAGO=From jealousy!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=                  Why, why is this?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To follow still the changes of the moon
Dialogue:OTHELLO=With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=When I shall turn the business of my soul
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
Dialogue:OTHELLO=The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And on the proof, there is no more but this,--
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Away at once with love or jealousy!
Dialogue:IAGO=I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
Dialogue:IAGO=To show the love and duty that I bear you
Dialogue:IAGO=With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,
Dialogue:IAGO=Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
Dialogue:IAGO=Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
Dialogue:IAGO=Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
Dialogue:IAGO=I would not have your free and noble nature,
Dialogue:IAGO=Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:
Dialogue:IAGO=I know our country disposition well;
Dialogue:IAGO=In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
Dialogue:IAGO=They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
Dialogue:IAGO=Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Dost thou say so?
Dialogue:IAGO=She did deceive her father, marrying you;
Dialogue:IAGO=And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
Dialogue:IAGO=She loved them most.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And so she did.
Dialogue:IAGO=Why, go to then;
Dialogue:IAGO=She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
Dialogue:IAGO=To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
Dialogue:IAGO=He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;
Dialogue:IAGO=I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
Dialogue:IAGO=For too much loving you.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I am bound to thee for ever.
Dialogue:IAGO=I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Not a jot, not a jot.
Dialogue:IAGO=I' faith, I fear it has.
Dialogue:IAGO=I hope you will consider what is spoke
Dialogue:IAGO=Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
Dialogue:IAGO=I am to pray you not to strain my speech
Dialogue:IAGO=To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Dialogue:IAGO=Than to suspicion.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I will not.
Dialogue:IAGO=          Should you do so, my lord,
Dialogue:IAGO=My speech should fall into such vile success
Dialogue:IAGO=As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--
Dialogue:IAGO=My lord, I see you're moved.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=No, not much moved:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I do not think but Desdemona's honest.
Dialogue:IAGO=Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And yet, how nature erring from itself,--
Dialogue:IAGO=Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--
Dialogue:IAGO=Not to affect many proposed matches
Dialogue:IAGO=Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
Dialogue:IAGO=Whereto we see in all things nature tends--
Dialogue:IAGO=Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,
Dialogue:IAGO=Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.
Dialogue:IAGO=But pardon me; I do not in position
Dialogue:IAGO=Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
Dialogue:IAGO=Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
Dialogue:IAGO=May fall to match you with her country forms
Dialogue:IAGO=And happily repent.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Farewell, farewell:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:
Dialogue:IAGO=[Going]  My lord, I take my leave.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
Dialogue:IAGO=[Returning]  My lord, I would I might entreat
Dialogue:IAGO=your honour
Dialogue:IAGO=To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:
Dialogue:IAGO=Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,
Dialogue:IAGO=For sure, he fills it up with great ability,
Dialogue:IAGO=Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
Dialogue:IAGO=You shall by that perceive him and his means:
Dialogue:IAGO=Note, if your lady strain his entertainment
Dialogue:IAGO=With any strong or vehement importunity;
Dialogue:IAGO=Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
Dialogue:IAGO=Let me be thought too busy in my fears--
Dialogue:IAGO=As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
Dialogue:IAGO=And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Fear not my government.
Dialogue:IAGO=I once more take my leave.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:OTHELLO=This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,

Dialogue:OTHELLO=Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,

Dialogue:OTHELLO=And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,

Dialogue:EMILIA=My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Dialogue:EMILIA=Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
Dialogue:EMILIA=For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
Dialogue:EMILIA=That she reserves it evermore about her

Dialogue:IAGO=To have a foolish wife.
Dialogue:EMILIA=O, is that all? What will you give me now
Dialogue:EMILIA=For the same handkerchief?
Dialogue:IAGO=What handkerchief?
Dialogue:EMILIA=What handkerchief?
Dialogue:EMILIA=Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;
Dialogue:EMILIA=That which so often you did bid me steal.
Dialogue:IAGO=Hast stol'n it from her?
Dialogue:EMILIA=No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.
Dialogue:EMILIA=And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.
Dialogue:EMILIA=Look, here it is.
Dialogue:IAGO=                  A good wench; give it me.
Dialogue:EMILIA=What will you do with 't, that you have been
Dialogue:EMILIA=so earnest
Dialogue:EMILIA=To have me filch it?

Dialogue:OTHELLO=Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I swear 'tis better to be much abused
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Than but to know't a little.
Dialogue:IAGO=How now, my lord!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:

Dialogue:OTHELLO=Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Than answer my waked wrath!
Dialogue:IAGO=Is't come to this?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,

Dialogue:IAGO=My noble lord,--
Dialogue:OTHELLO=If thou dost slander her and torture me,

Dialogue:IAGO=That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
Dialogue:IAGO=O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
Dialogue:IAGO=To be direct and honest is not safe.
Dialogue:IAGO=I thank you for this profit; and from hence
Dialogue:IAGO=I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.
Dialogue:IAGO=I should be wise, for honesty's a fool
Dialogue:IAGO=And loses that it works for.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=By the world,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
Dialogue:OTHELLO=As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
Dialogue:OTHELLO=As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
Dialogue:IAGO=I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
Dialogue:IAGO=I do repent me that I put it to you.
Dialogue:IAGO=You would be satisfied?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Would! nay, I will.
Dialogue:IAGO=And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
Dialogue:IAGO=Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--
Dialogue:IAGO=Behold her topp'd?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=                  Death and damnation! O!
Dialogue:IAGO=It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
Dialogue:IAGO=To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,
Dialogue:IAGO=If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
Dialogue:IAGO=More than their own! What then? how then?
Dialogue:IAGO=What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
Dialogue:IAGO=It is impossible you should see this,
Dialogue:IAGO=Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
Dialogue:IAGO=As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
Dialogue:IAGO=As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
Dialogue:IAGO=If imputation and strong circumstances,
Dialogue:IAGO=Which lead directly to the door of truth,
Dialogue:IAGO=Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
Dialogue:IAGO=I do not like the office:
Dialogue:IAGO=But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
Dialogue:IAGO=Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
Dialogue:IAGO=I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;
Dialogue:IAGO=And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
Dialogue:IAGO=I could not sleep.
Dialogue:IAGO=There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
Dialogue:IAGO=That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
Dialogue:IAGO=One of this kind is Cassio:
Dialogue:IAGO=In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,
Dialogue:IAGO=Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'
Dialogue:IAGO=And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
Dialogue:IAGO=Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
Dialogue:IAGO=As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
Dialogue:IAGO=That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
Dialogue:IAGO=Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
Dialogue:IAGO=Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'
Dialogue:OTHELLO=O monstrous! monstrous!
Dialogue:IAGO=Nay, this was but his dream.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
Dialogue:OTHELLO='Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
Dialogue:IAGO=And this may help to thicken other proofs
Dialogue:IAGO=That do demonstrate thinly.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I'll tear her all to pieces.
Dialogue:IAGO=Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
Dialogue:IAGO=She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
Dialogue:IAGO=Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
Dialogue:IAGO=Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
Dialogue:IAGO=I know not that; but such a handkerchief--
Dialogue:IAGO=I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day
Dialogue:IAGO=See Cassio wipe his beard with.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=If it be that--
Dialogue:IAGO=If it be that, or any that was hers,
Dialogue:IAGO=It speaks against her with the other proofs.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
Dialogue:OTHELLO='Tis gone.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
Dialogue:IAGO=Yet be content.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=O, blood, blood, blood!
Dialogue:IAGO=Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Whose icy current and compulsive course
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,

Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Go to: where lodges he?
Dialogue:Clown=To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.

Dialogue:OTHELLO=This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:

Dialogue:OTHELLO=That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=A frank one.
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=                  You may, indeed, say so;
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.

Dialogue:OTHELLO=Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Or made gift of it, my father's eye

Dialogue:OTHELLO=And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Make it a darling like your precious eye;
Dialogue:OTHELLO=To lose't or give't away were such perdition
Dialogue:OTHELLO=As nothing else could match.

Dialogue:IAGO=What,
Dialogue:IAGO=To kiss in private?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=An unauthorized kiss.
Dialogue:IAGO=Or to be naked with her friend in bed
Dialogue:IAGO=An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=It is hypocrisy against the devil:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.
Dialogue:IAGO=So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:
Dialogue:IAGO=But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--
Dialogue:OTHELLO=What then?
Dialogue:IAGO=Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,
Dialogue:IAGO=She may, I think, bestow't on any man.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=She is protectress of her honour too:
Dialogue:OTHELLO=May she give that?

Dialogue:IAGO=But, for the handkerchief,--
Dialogue:OTHELLO=By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,

Dialogue:OTHELLO=Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.
Dialogue:IAGO=Ay, what of that?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=                  That's not so good now.
Dialogue:IAGO=What,
Dialogue:IAGO=If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?

Dialogue:OTHELLO=What? what?
Dialogue:IAGO=Lie--
Dialogue:OTHELLO=    With her?
Dialogue:IAGO=With her, on her; what you will.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when

Dialogue:OTHELLO=--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To

Dialogue:IAGO=Stand you awhile apart;
Dialogue:IAGO=Confine yourself but in a patient list.
Dialogue:IAGO=Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--
Dialogue:IAGO=A passion most unsuiting such a man--
Dialogue:IAGO=Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
Dialogue:IAGO=And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,
Dialogue:IAGO=Bade him anon return and here speak with me;
Dialogue:IAGO=The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,
Dialogue:IAGO=And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
Dialogue:IAGO=That dwell in every region of his face;
Dialogue:IAGO=For I will make him tell the tale anew,
Dialogue:IAGO=Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
Dialogue:IAGO=He hath, and is again to cope your wife:
Dialogue:IAGO=I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
Dialogue:IAGO=Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
Dialogue:IAGO=And nothing of a man.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Dost thou hear, Iago?
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I will be found most cunning in my patience;

Dialogue:IAGO=To beguile many and be beguiled by one:
Dialogue:IAGO=He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
Dialogue:IAGO=From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:
Notice:Re-enter CASSIO
Dialogue:IAGO=As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
Dialogue:IAGO=And his unbookish jealousy must construe
Dialogue:IAGO=Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,
Dialogue:IAGO=Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?

Dialogue:CASSIO=flattery, not out of my promise.
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
Dialogue:CASSIO=She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.

Dialogue:CASSIO=certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,
Dialogue:CASSIO=and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture

Dialogue:CASSIO=So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,
Dialogue:CASSIO=and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!
Dialogue:OTHELLO=Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,
Dialogue:OTHELLO=I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall

Dialogue:OTHELLO=for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to

Dialogue:DESDEMONA=If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Delighted them in any other form;

Dialogue:DESDEMONA=And ever will--though he do shake me off

Dialogue:DESDEMONA=To do the act that might the addition earn
Dialogue:DESDEMONA=Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.
Dialogue:IAGO=I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:

Dialogue:IAGO=Will you hear me, Roderigo?
Dialogue:RODERIGO='Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
Dialogue:RODERIGO=performances are no kin together.
Dialogue:IAGO=You charge me most unjustly.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of
Dialogue:RODERIGO=my means. The jewels you have had from me to
Dialogue:RODERIGO=deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
Dialogue:RODERIGO=votarist: you have told me she hath received them

Dialogue:RODERIGO=to find myself fobbed in it.
Dialogue:IAGO=Very well.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself
Dialogue:RODERIGO=known to Desdemona: if she will return me my
Dialogue:RODERIGO=jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my
Dialogue:RODERIGO=unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I
Dialogue:RODERIGO=will seek satisfaction of you.
Dialogue:IAGO=You have said now.

Dialogue:IAGO=Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from
Dialogue:IAGO=this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
Dialogue:IAGO=ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast

Dialogue:IAGO=protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=It hath not appeared.
Dialogue:IAGO=I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your
Dialogue:IAGO=suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,
Dialogue:IAGO=Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I
Dialogue:IAGO=have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean
Dialogue:IAGO=purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if
Dialogue:IAGO=thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,

Dialogue:RODERIGO=Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?

Dialogue:IAGO=O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with
Dialogue:IAGO=him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be
Dialogue:IAGO=lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
Dialogue:IAGO=so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=How do you mean, removing of him?
Dialogue:IAGO=Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;
Dialogue:IAGO=knocking out his brains.
Dialogue:RODERIGO=And that you would have me to do?
Dialogue:IAGO=Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
Dialogue:IAGO=He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I
Dialogue:IAGO=go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
Dialogue:IAGO=fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which
Dialogue:IAGO=I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,
Dialogue:IAGO=you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near
Dialogue:IAGO=to second your attempt, and he shall fall between
Dialogue:IAGO=us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with
Dialogue:IAGO=me; I will show you such a necessity in his death
Dialogue:IAGO=that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
