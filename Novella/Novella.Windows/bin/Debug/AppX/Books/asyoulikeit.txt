Notice#Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
Dialogue#ORLANDO=As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
Dialogue#ORLANDO=bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
Dialogue#ORLANDO=blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
Dialogue#ORLANDO=sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
Dialogue#ORLANDO=report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
Dialogue#ORLANDO=properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
Dialogue#ORLANDO=that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
Dialogue#ORLANDO=differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
Dialogue#ORLANDO=are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
Dialogue#ORLANDO=with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
Dialogue#ORLANDO=brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
Dialogue#ORLANDO=which his animals on his dunghills are as much
Dialogue#ORLANDO=bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
Dialogue#ORLANDO=plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
Dialogue#ORLANDO=me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
Dialogue#ORLANDO=me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
Dialogue#ORLANDO=brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
Dialogue#ORLANDO=gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
Dialogue#ORLANDO=grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
Dialogue#ORLANDO=think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
Dialogue#ORLANDO=servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
Dialogue#ORLANDO=know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
Dialogue#ADAM=Yonder comes my master, your brother.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
Dialogue#ORLANDO=shake me up.
Notice#Enter OLIVER
Dialogue#OLIVER=Now, sir! what make you here?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
Dialogue#OLIVER=What mar you then, sir?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
Dialogue#ORLANDO=made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
Dialogue#OLIVER=Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
Dialogue#ORLANDO=come to such penury?
Dialogue#OLIVER=Know you where your are, sir?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
Dialogue#OLIVER=Know you before whom, sir?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
Dialogue#ORLANDO=you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle
Dialogue#ORLANDO=condition of blood, you should so know me. The
Dialogue#ORLANDO=courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
Dialogue#ORLANDO=you are the first-born; but the same tradition
Dialogue#ORLANDO=takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
Dialogue#ORLANDO=betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
Dialogue#ORLANDO=you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
Dialogue#ORLANDO=nearer to his reverence.
Dialogue#OLIVER=What, boy!
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
Dialogue#OLIVER=Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice
Dialogue#ORLANDO=a villain that says such a father begot villains.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
Dialogue#ORLANDO=from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
Dialogue#ORLANDO=tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.
Dialogue#ADAM=Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's
Dialogue#ADAM=remembrance, be at accord.
Dialogue#OLIVER=Let me go, I say.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
Dialogue#ORLANDO=father charged you in his will to give me good
Dialogue#ORLANDO=education: you have trained me like a peasant,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
Dialogue#ORLANDO=qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
Dialogue#ORLANDO=me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
Dialogue#ORLANDO=me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
Dialogue#ORLANDO=give me the poor allottery my father left me by
Dialogue#ORLANDO=testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.
Dialogue#OLIVER=And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
Dialogue#OLIVER=Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
Dialogue#OLIVER=with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
Dialogue#OLIVER=pray you, leave me.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
Dialogue#OLIVER=Get you with him, you old dog.
Dialogue#ADAM=Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
Dialogue#ADAM=teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
Dialogue#ADAM=he would not have spoke such a word.
Notice#Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM
Dialogue#OLIVER=Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
Dialogue#OLIVER=physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
Dialogue#OLIVER=crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!
Notice#Enter DENNIS
Dialogue#DENNIS=Calls your worship?
Dialogue#OLIVER=Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
Dialogue#DENNIS=So please you, he is here at the door and importunes
Dialogue#DENNIS=access to you.
Dialogue#OLIVER=Call him in.
Notice#Exit DENNIS
Dialogue#OLIVER='Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.
Notice#Enter CHARLES
Dialogue#CHARLES=Good morrow to your worship.
Dialogue#OLIVER=Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the
Dialogue#OLIVER=new court?
Dialogue#CHARLES=There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:
Dialogue#CHARLES=that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
Dialogue#CHARLES=brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
Dialogue#CHARLES=have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
Dialogue#CHARLES=whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
Dialogue#CHARLES=therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
Dialogue#OLIVER=Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be
Dialogue#OLIVER=banished with her father?
Dialogue#CHARLES=O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
Dialogue#CHARLES=her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
Dialogue#CHARLES=that she would have followed her exile, or have died
Dialogue#CHARLES=to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
Dialogue#CHARLES=less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
Dialogue#CHARLES=never two ladies loved as they do.
Dialogue#OLIVER=Where will the old duke live?
Dialogue#CHARLES=They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
Dialogue#CHARLES=a many merry men with him; and there they live like
Dialogue#CHARLES=the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
Dialogue#CHARLES=gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
Dialogue#CHARLES=carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
Dialogue#OLIVER=What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?
Dialogue#CHARLES=Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
Dialogue#CHARLES=matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
Dialogue#CHARLES=that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
Dialogue#CHARLES=to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
Dialogue#CHARLES=To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
Dialogue#CHARLES=escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
Dialogue#CHARLES=well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
Dialogue#CHARLES=for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
Dialogue#CHARLES=must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
Dialogue#CHARLES=out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
Dialogue#CHARLES=withal, that either you might stay him from his
Dialogue#CHARLES=intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
Dialogue#CHARLES=run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
Dialogue#CHARLES=and altogether against my will.
Dialogue#OLIVER=Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
Dialogue#OLIVER=thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
Dialogue#OLIVER=myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
Dialogue#OLIVER=have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
Dialogue#OLIVER=it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:
Dialogue#OLIVER=it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
Dialogue#OLIVER=of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's
Dialogue#OLIVER=good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
Dialogue#OLIVER=me his natural brother: therefore use thy
Dialogue#OLIVER=discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
Dialogue#OLIVER=as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
Dialogue#OLIVER=thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
Dialogue#OLIVER=mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
Dialogue#OLIVER=against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
Dialogue#OLIVER=treacherous device and never leave thee till he
Dialogue#OLIVER=hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
Dialogue#OLIVER=for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
Dialogue#OLIVER=it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
Dialogue#OLIVER=day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
Dialogue#OLIVER=should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
Dialogue#OLIVER=blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
Dialogue#CHARLES=I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
Dialogue#CHARLES=to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go
Dialogue#CHARLES=alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and
Dialogue#CHARLES=so God keep your worship!
Dialogue#OLIVER=Farewell, good Charles.
Notice#Exit CHARLES
Dialogue#OLIVER=Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
Dialogue#OLIVER=an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
Dialogue#OLIVER=hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never
Dialogue#OLIVER=schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
Dialogue#OLIVER=all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
Dialogue#OLIVER=in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
Dialogue#OLIVER=people, who best know him, that I am altogether
Dialogue#OLIVER=misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
Dialogue#OLIVER=wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
Dialogue#OLIVER=I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.

Notice#Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
Dialogue#CELIA=I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
Dialogue#ROSALIND=and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
Dialogue#ROSALIND=teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
Dialogue#ROSALIND=learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
Dialogue#CELIA=Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
Dialogue#CELIA=that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
Dialogue#CELIA=had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
Dialogue#CELIA=hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
Dialogue#CELIA=love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
Dialogue#CELIA=if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
Dialogue#CELIA=tempered as mine is to thee.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
Dialogue#ROSALIND=rejoice in yours.
Dialogue#CELIA=You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
Dialogue#CELIA=like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
Dialogue#CELIA=be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
Dialogue#CELIA=father perforce, I will render thee again in
Dialogue#CELIA=affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
Dialogue#CELIA=that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
Dialogue#CELIA=sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
Dialogue#ROSALIND=me see; what think you of falling in love?
Dialogue#CELIA=Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
Dialogue#CELIA=love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
Dialogue#CELIA=neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
Dialogue#CELIA=in honour come off again.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=What shall be our sport, then?
Dialogue#CELIA=Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
Dialogue#CELIA=her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I would we could do so, for her benefits are
Dialogue#ROSALIND=mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
Dialogue#ROSALIND=doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
Dialogue#CELIA='Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
Dialogue#CELIA=makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
Dialogue#CELIA=makes very ill-favouredly.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=not in the lineaments of Nature.
Notice#Enter TOUCHSTONE
Dialogue#CELIA=No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
Dialogue#CELIA=not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
Dialogue#CELIA=hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
Dialogue#CELIA=Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Nature's wit.
Dialogue#CELIA=Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
Dialogue#CELIA=Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
Dialogue#CELIA=to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
Dialogue#CELIA=natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
Dialogue#CELIA=the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
Dialogue#CELIA=wit! whither wander you?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Mistress, you must come away to your father.
Dialogue#CELIA=Were you made the messenger?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Where learned you that oath, fool?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=yet was not the knight forsworn.
Dialogue#CELIA=How prove you that, in the great heap of your
Dialogue#CELIA=knowledge?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=swear by your beards that I am a knave.
Dialogue#CELIA=By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.
Dialogue#CELIA=Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
Dialogue#CELIA=My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
Dialogue#CELIA=speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
Dialogue#CELIA=one of these days.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=wise men do foolishly.
Dialogue#CELIA=By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little
Dialogue#CELIA=wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
Dialogue#CELIA=that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
Dialogue#CELIA=Monsieur Le Beau.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=With his mouth full of news.
Dialogue#CELIA=Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Then shall we be news-crammed.
Dialogue#CELIA=All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
Notice#Enter LE BEAU
Dialogue#CELIA=Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?
Dialogue#LE BEAU=Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
Dialogue#CELIA=Sport! of what colour?
Dialogue#LE BEAU=What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=As wit and fortune will.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Or as the Destinies decree.
Dialogue#CELIA=Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Nay, if I keep not my rank,--
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Thou losest thy old smell.
Dialogue#LE BEAU=You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
Dialogue#LE BEAU=wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
Dialogue#LE BEAU=I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please
Dialogue#LE BEAU=your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
Dialogue#LE BEAU=yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
Dialogue#LE BEAU=to perform it.
Dialogue#CELIA=Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
Dialogue#LE BEAU=There comes an old man and his three sons,--
Dialogue#CELIA=I could match this beginning with an old tale.
Dialogue#LE BEAU=Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
Dialogue#ROSALIND=by these presents.'
Dialogue#LE BEAU=The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
Dialogue#LE BEAU=duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
Dialogue#LE BEAU=and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
Dialogue#LE BEAU=hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
Dialogue#LE BEAU=so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
Dialogue#LE BEAU=their father, making such pitiful dole over them
Dialogue#LE BEAU=that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Alas!
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=have lost?
Dialogue#LE BEAU=Why, this that I speak of.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=for ladies.
Dialogue#CELIA=Or I, I promise thee.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=But is there any else longs to see this broken music
Dialogue#ROSALIND=in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
Dialogue#ROSALIND=rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
Dialogue#LE BEAU=You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
Dialogue#LE BEAU=appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
Dialogue#LE BEAU=perform it.
Dialogue#CELIA=Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.
Notice#Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and Attendants
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=own peril on his forwardness.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Is yonder the man?
Dialogue#LE BEAU=Even he, madam.
Dialogue#CELIA=Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=to see the wrestling?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=you can move him.
Dialogue#CELIA=Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Do so: I'll not be by.
Dialogue#LE BEAU=Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I attend them with all respect and duty.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I
Dialogue#ORLANDO=come but in, as others do, to try with him the
Dialogue#ORLANDO=strength of my youth.
Dialogue#CELIA=Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
Dialogue#CELIA=years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
Dialogue#CELIA=strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
Dialogue#CELIA=knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
Dialogue#CELIA=adventure would counsel you to a more equal
Dialogue#CELIA=enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
Dialogue#CELIA=embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore
Dialogue#ROSALIND=be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
Dialogue#ROSALIND=that the wrestling might not go forward.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
Dialogue#ORLANDO=thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny
Dialogue#ORLANDO=so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
Dialogue#ORLANDO=your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
Dialogue#ORLANDO=trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one
Dialogue#ORLANDO=shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one
Dialogue#ORLANDO=dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
Dialogue#ORLANDO=friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the
Dialogue#ORLANDO=world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in
Dialogue#ORLANDO=the world I fill up a place, which may be better
Dialogue#ORLANDO=supplied when I have made it empty.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.
Dialogue#CELIA=And mine, to eke out hers.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!
Dialogue#CELIA=Your heart's desires be with you!
Dialogue#CHARLES=Come, where is this young gallant that is so
Dialogue#CHARLES=desirous to lie with his mother earth?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=You shall try but one fall.
Dialogue#CHARLES=No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him
Dialogue#CHARLES=to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him
Dialogue#CHARLES=from a first.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=An you mean to mock me after, you should not have
Dialogue#ORLANDO=mocked me before: but come your ways.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!
Dialogue#CELIA=I would I were invisible, to catch the strong
Dialogue#CELIA=fellow by the leg.
Notice#They wrestle
Dialogue#ROSALIND=O excellent young man!
Dialogue#CELIA=If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who
Dialogue#CELIA=should down.
Notice#Shout. CHARLES is thrown
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=No more, no more.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=How dost thou, Charles?
Dialogue#LE BEAU=He cannot speak, my lord.
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=But I did find him still mine enemy:
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Hadst thou descended from another house.
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=I would thou hadst told me of another father.
Notice#Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU
Dialogue#CELIA=Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=His youngest son; and would not change that calling,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=To be adopted heir to Frederick.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=And all the world was of my father's mind:
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Had I before known this young man his son,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I should have given him tears unto entreaties,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Ere he should thus have ventured.
Dialogue#CELIA=Gentle cousin,
Dialogue#CELIA=Let us go thank him and encourage him:
Dialogue#CELIA=My father's rough and envious disposition
Dialogue#CELIA=Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:
Dialogue#CELIA=If you do keep your promises in love
Dialogue#CELIA=But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
Dialogue#CELIA=Your mistress shall be happy.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Gentleman,
Notice#Giving him a chain from her neck
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Shall we go, coz?
Dialogue#CELIA=                  Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
Dialogue#ROSALIND=More than your enemies.
Dialogue#CELIA=Will you go, coz?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Have with you. Fare you well.
Notice#Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
Dialogue#ORLANDO=What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
Notice#Re-enter LE BEAU
Dialogue#LE BEAU=Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
Dialogue#LE BEAU=To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
Dialogue#LE BEAU=High commendation, true applause and love,
Dialogue#LE BEAU=Yet such is now the duke's condition
Dialogue#LE BEAU=That he misconstrues all that you have done.
Dialogue#LE BEAU=The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,
Dialogue#LE BEAU=More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Which of the two was daughter of the duke
Dialogue#ORLANDO=That here was at the wrestling?
Dialogue#LE BEAU=Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
Dialogue#LE BEAU=But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
Dialogue#LE BEAU=The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
Dialogue#LE BEAU=And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
Dialogue#LE BEAU=To keep his daughter company; whose loves
Dialogue#LE BEAU=Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
Dialogue#LE BEAU=But I can tell you that of late this duke
Dialogue#LE BEAU=Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
Dialogue#LE BEAU=Grounded upon no other argument
Dialogue#LE BEAU=But that the people praise her for her virtues
Dialogue#LE BEAU=And pity her for her good father's sake;
Dialogue#LE BEAU=And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
Dialogue#LE BEAU=Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
Dialogue#LE BEAU=Hereafter, in a better world than this,
Dialogue#LE BEAU=I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.

Dialogue#CELIA=curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one

Dialogue#ROSALIND=I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.
Dialogue#CELIA=Hem them away.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
Dialogue#CELIA=Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!
Dialogue#CELIA=O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in
Dialogue#CELIA=despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of
Dialogue#CELIA=service, let us talk in good earnest: is it
Dialogue#CELIA=possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so
Dialogue#CELIA=strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=The duke my father loved his father dearly.
Dialogue#CELIA=Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
Dialogue#CELIA=dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,
Dialogue#CELIA=for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate
Dialogue#CELIA=not Orlando.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
Dialogue#CELIA=Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Let me love him for that, and do you love him
Dialogue#ROSALIND=because I do. Look, here comes the duke.
Dialogue#CELIA=With his eyes full of anger.

Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste

Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=You, cousin
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=So near our public court as twenty miles,
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Thou diest for it.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=                  I do beseech your grace,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
Dialogue#ROSALIND=If with myself I hold intelligence
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
Dialogue#ROSALIND=As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Never so much as in a thought unborn
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Did I offend your highness.
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Thus do all traitors:
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=If their purgation did consist in words,
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=They are as innocent as grace itself:
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
Dialogue#ROSALIND=So was I when your highness banish'd him:
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Treason is not inherited, my lord;
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
Dialogue#ROSALIND=To think my poverty is treacherous.
Dialogue#CELIA=Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Else had she with her father ranged along.
Dialogue#CELIA=I did not then entreat to have her stay;
Dialogue#CELIA=It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
Dialogue#CELIA=I was too young that time to value her;
Dialogue#CELIA=But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
Dialogue#CELIA=Why so am I; we still have slept together,
Dialogue#CELIA=Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,
Dialogue#CELIA=And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,
Dialogue#CELIA=Still we went coupled and inseparable.
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Her very silence and her patience
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Speak to the people, and they pity her.
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Firm and irrevocable is my doom
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
Dialogue#CELIA=Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:
Dialogue#CELIA=I cannot live out of her company.
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=And in the greatness of my word, you die.

Dialogue#ROSALIND=I have more cause.
Dialogue#CELIA=                  Thou hast not, cousin;
Dialogue#CELIA=Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke
Dialogue#CELIA=Hath banish'd me, his daughter?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=That he hath not.
Dialogue#CELIA=No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
Dialogue#CELIA=Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
Dialogue#CELIA=Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
Dialogue#CELIA=No: let my father seek another heir.
Dialogue#CELIA=Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
Dialogue#CELIA=Whither to go and what to bear with us;
Dialogue#CELIA=And do not seek to take your change upon you,
Dialogue#CELIA=To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
Dialogue#CELIA=For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
Dialogue#CELIA=Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Why, whither shall we go?
Dialogue#CELIA=To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Alas, what danger will it be to us,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
Dialogue#CELIA=I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
Dialogue#CELIA=And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
Dialogue#CELIA=The like do you: so shall we pass along
Dialogue#CELIA=And never stir assailants.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Were it not better,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Because that I am more than common tall,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=That I did suit me all points like a man?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
Dialogue#ROSALIND=We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=As many other mannish cowards have
Dialogue#ROSALIND=That do outface it with their semblances.
Dialogue#CELIA=What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;
Dialogue#ROSALIND=And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=But what will you be call'd?
Dialogue#CELIA=Something that hath a reference to my state
Dialogue#CELIA=No longer Celia, but Aliena.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
Dialogue#ROSALIND=The clownish fool out of your father's court?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
Dialogue#CELIA=He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
Dialogue#CELIA=Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
Dialogue#CELIA=And get our jewels and our wealth together,
Dialogue#CELIA=Devise the fittest time and safest way
Dialogue#CELIA=To hide us from pursuit that will be made
Dialogue#CELIA=After my flight. Now go we in content
Dialogue#CELIA=To liberty and not to banishment.

Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=More free from peril than the envious court?
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,

Dialogue#First Lord=Indeed, my lord,
Dialogue#First Lord=The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
Dialogue#First Lord=And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp

Dialogue#First Lord=To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself

Dialogue#First Lord=That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
Dialogue#First Lord=Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
Dialogue#First Lord=Coursed one another down his innocent nose
Dialogue#First Lord=In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool
Dialogue#First Lord=Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
Dialogue#First Lord=Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
Dialogue#First Lord=Augmenting it with tears.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=But what said Jaques?
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Did he not moralize this spectacle?
Dialogue#First Lord=O, yes, into a thousand similes.
Dialogue#First Lord=First, for his weeping into the needless stream;
Dialogue#First Lord='Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament
Dialogue#First Lord=As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
Dialogue#First Lord=To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,
Dialogue#First Lord=Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,
Dialogue#First Lord=''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part
Dialogue#First Lord=The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,
Dialogue#First Lord=Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
Dialogue#First Lord=And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,
Dialogue#First Lord='Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
Dialogue#First Lord='Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
Dialogue#First Lord=Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
Dialogue#First Lord=Thus most invectively he pierceth through
Dialogue#First Lord=The body of the country, city, court,
Dialogue#First Lord=Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
Dialogue#First Lord=Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,
Dialogue#First Lord=To fright the animals and to kill them up
Dialogue#First Lord=In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=And did you leave him in this contemplation?
Dialogue#Second Lord=We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
Dialogue#Second Lord=Upon the sobbing deer.

Dialogue#First Lord=The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,

Dialogue#ADAM=O my sweet master! O you memory
Dialogue#ADAM=Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?
Dialogue#ADAM=Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
Dialogue#ADAM=And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?
Dialogue#ADAM=Why would you be so fond to overcome
Dialogue#ADAM=The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
Dialogue#ADAM=Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
Dialogue#ADAM=Know you not, master, to some kind of men
Dialogue#ADAM=Their graces serve them but as enemies?
Dialogue#ADAM=No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
Dialogue#ADAM=Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
Dialogue#ADAM=O, what a world is this, when what is comely
Dialogue#ADAM=Envenoms him that bears it!
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Why, what's the matter?
Dialogue#ADAM=O unhappy youth!
Dialogue#ADAM=Come not within these doors; within this roof
Dialogue#ADAM=The enemy of all your graces lives:

Dialogue#ADAM=Yet not the son, I will not call him son
Dialogue#ADAM=Of him I was about to call his father--
Dialogue#ADAM=Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
Dialogue#ADAM=To burn the lodging where you use to lie
Dialogue#ADAM=And you within it: if he fail of that,

Dialogue#ADAM=I overheard him and his practises.
Dialogue#ADAM=This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
Dialogue#ADAM=Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
Dialogue#ADAM=No matter whither, so you come not here.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
Dialogue#ORLANDO=A thievish living on the common road?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=This I must do, or know not what to do:
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Yet this I will not do, do how I can;
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I rather will subject me to the malice
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
Dialogue#ADAM=But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
Dialogue#ADAM=The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
Dialogue#ADAM=Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
Dialogue#ADAM=When service should in my old limbs lie lame
Dialogue#ADAM=And unregarded age in corners thrown:
Dialogue#ADAM=Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
Dialogue#ADAM=Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
Dialogue#ADAM=Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
Dialogue#ADAM=And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
Dialogue#ADAM=Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
Dialogue#ADAM=For in my youth I never did apply
Dialogue#ADAM=Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
Dialogue#ADAM=Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
Dialogue#ADAM=The means of weakness and debility;
Dialogue#ADAM=Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,

Dialogue#ADAM=In all your business and necessities.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=O good old man, how well in thee appears
Dialogue#ORLANDO=The constant service of the antique world,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Where none will sweat but for promotion,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=And having that, do choke their service up
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=That cannot so much as a blossom yield
Dialogue#ORLANDO=In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
Dialogue#ORLANDO=But come thy ways; well go along together,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=We'll light upon some settled low content.
Dialogue#ADAM=Master, go on, and I will follow thee,
Dialogue#ADAM=To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
Dialogue#ADAM=From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
Dialogue#ADAM=Here lived I, but now live here no more.
Dialogue#ADAM=At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;

Dialogue#ORLANDO=For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at
Dialogue#ORLANDO=the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;
Dialogue#ORLANDO=and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will
Dialogue#ORLANDO=give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I
Dialogue#ORLANDO=come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
Dialogue#ORLANDO=thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear
Dialogue#ORLANDO=thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for
Dialogue#ORLANDO=lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this
Dialogue#ORLANDO=desert. Cheerly, good Adam!

Banner#SCENE VII. The forest.
Notice#A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and Lords like outlaws
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=I think he be transform'd into a beast;
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=For I can no where find him like a man.
Dialogue#First Lord=My lord, he is but even now gone hence:
Dialogue#First Lord=Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.
Notice#Enter JAQUES
Dialogue#First Lord=He saves my labour by his own approach.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=That your poor friends must woo your company?
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=What, you look merrily!
Dialogue#JAQUES=A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,
Dialogue#JAQUES=A motley fool; a miserable world!
Dialogue#JAQUES=As I do live by food, I met a fool
Dialogue#JAQUES=Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
Dialogue#JAQUES=And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
Dialogue#JAQUES=In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
Dialogue#JAQUES='Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,
Dialogue#JAQUES='Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'
Dialogue#JAQUES=And then he drew a dial from his poke,
Dialogue#JAQUES=And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:
Dialogue#JAQUES=Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:
Dialogue#JAQUES='Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
Dialogue#JAQUES=And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
Dialogue#JAQUES=And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
Dialogue#JAQUES=And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
Dialogue#JAQUES=And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
Dialogue#JAQUES=The motley fool thus moral on the time,
Dialogue#JAQUES=My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
Dialogue#JAQUES=That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
Dialogue#JAQUES=And I did laugh sans intermission
Dialogue#JAQUES=An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
Dialogue#JAQUES=A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=What fool is this?
Dialogue#JAQUES=O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
Dialogue#JAQUES=And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
Dialogue#JAQUES=They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
Dialogue#JAQUES=After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
Dialogue#JAQUES=With observation, the which he vents
Dialogue#JAQUES=In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
Dialogue#JAQUES=I am ambitious for a motley coat.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Thou shalt have one.
Dialogue#JAQUES=It is my only suit;
Dialogue#JAQUES=Provided that you weed your better judgments
Dialogue#JAQUES=Of all opinion that grows rank in them
Dialogue#JAQUES=That I am wise. I must have liberty
Dialogue#JAQUES=Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
Dialogue#JAQUES=To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;
Dialogue#JAQUES=And they that are most galled with my folly,
Dialogue#JAQUES=They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
Dialogue#JAQUES=The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
Dialogue#JAQUES=He that a fool doth very wisely hit
Dialogue#JAQUES=Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,
Dialogue#JAQUES=The wise man's folly is anatomized
Dialogue#JAQUES=Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
Dialogue#JAQUES=Invest me in my motley; give me leave
Dialogue#JAQUES=To speak my mind, and I will through and through
Dialogue#JAQUES=Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
Dialogue#JAQUES=If they will patiently receive my medicine.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
Dialogue#JAQUES=What, for a counter, would I do but good?
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=And all the embossed sores and headed evils,
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
Dialogue#JAQUES=Why, who cries out on pride,
Dialogue#JAQUES=That can therein tax any private party?
Dialogue#JAQUES=Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Till that the weary very means do ebb?
Dialogue#JAQUES=What woman in the city do I name,
Dialogue#JAQUES=When that I say the city-woman bears
Dialogue#JAQUES=The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
Dialogue#JAQUES=Who can come in and say that I mean her,
Dialogue#JAQUES=When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
Dialogue#JAQUES=Or what is he of basest function
Dialogue#JAQUES=That says his bravery is not of my cost,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
Dialogue#JAQUES=His folly to the mettle of my speech?
Dialogue#JAQUES=There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein
Dialogue#JAQUES=My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
Notice#Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Forbear, and eat no more.
Dialogue#JAQUES=Why, I have eat none yet.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.
Dialogue#JAQUES=Of what kind should this cock come of?
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
Dialogue#ORLANDO=And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:
Dialogue#ORLANDO=He dies that touches any of this fruit
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Till I and my affairs are answered.
Dialogue#JAQUES=An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=More than your force move us to gentleness.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I almost die for food; and let me have it.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I thought that all things had been savage here;
Dialogue#ORLANDO=And therefore put I on the countenance
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
Dialogue#ORLANDO=That in this desert inaccessible,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
Dialogue#ORLANDO=If ever you have look'd on better days,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=If ever sat at any good man's feast,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
Dialogue#ORLANDO=And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:
Dialogue#ORLANDO=In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=True is it that we have seen better days,
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=And therefore sit you down in gentleness
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=And take upon command what help we have
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=That to your wanting may be minister'd.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Then but forbear your food a little while,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn
Dialogue#ORLANDO=And give it food. There is an old poor man,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Who after me hath many a weary step
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I will not touch a bit.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Go find him out,
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=And we will nothing waste till you return.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=This wide and universal theatre
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Wherein we play in.
Dialogue#JAQUES=All the world's a stage,
Dialogue#JAQUES=And all the men and women merely players:
Dialogue#JAQUES=They have their exits and their entrances;
Dialogue#JAQUES=And one man in his time plays many parts,
Dialogue#JAQUES=His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Dialogue#JAQUES=And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
Dialogue#JAQUES=And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Dialogue#JAQUES=Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Dialogue#JAQUES=Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Seeking the bubble reputation
Dialogue#JAQUES=Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
Dialogue#JAQUES=In fair round belly with good capon lined,
Dialogue#JAQUES=With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Full of wise saws and modern instances;
Dialogue#JAQUES=And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Dialogue#JAQUES=Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
Dialogue#JAQUES=With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
Dialogue#JAQUES=His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
Dialogue#JAQUES=For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
Dialogue#JAQUES=And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
Dialogue#JAQUES=That ends this strange eventful history,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Dialogue#JAQUES=Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
Notice#Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM

Dialogue#ADAM=I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=SONG.
Dialogue#AMIENS=Blow, blow, thou winter wind.
Dialogue#AMIENS=Thou art not so unkind
Dialogue#AMIENS=As man's ingratitude;
Dialogue#AMIENS=Thy tooth is not so keen,
Dialogue#AMIENS=Because thou art not seen,
Dialogue#AMIENS=Although thy breath be rude.
Dialogue#AMIENS=Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
Dialogue#AMIENS=Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
Dialogue#AMIENS=Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
Dialogue#AMIENS=This life is most jolly.
Dialogue#AMIENS=Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
Dialogue#AMIENS=That dost not bite so nigh
Dialogue#AMIENS=As benefits forgot:
Dialogue#AMIENS=Though thou the waters warp,
Dialogue#AMIENS=Thy sting is not so sharp
Dialogue#AMIENS=As friend remember'd not.

Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=To seek a living in our territory.

Dialogue#DUKE FREDERICK=Of what we think against thee.
Dialogue#OLIVER=O that your highness knew my heart in this!
Dialogue#OLIVER=I never loved my brother in my life.

Notice#Exit
Notice#Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
Dialogue#CORIN=And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=like it very well; but in respect that it is
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?
Dialogue#CORIN=No more but that I know the more one sickens the
Dialogue#CORIN=worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,
Dialogue#CORIN=means and content is without three good friends;
Dialogue#CORIN=that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
Dialogue#CORIN=burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a
Dialogue#CORIN=great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that
Dialogue#CORIN=he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
Dialogue#CORIN=complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=court, shepherd?
Dialogue#CORIN=No, truly.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Then thou art damned.
Dialogue#CORIN=Nay, I hope.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=on one side.
Dialogue#CORIN=For not being at court? Your reason.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=state, shepherd.
Dialogue#CORIN=Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners
Dialogue#CORIN=at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
Dialogue#CORIN=behavior of the country is most mockable at the
Dialogue#CORIN=court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
Dialogue#CORIN=you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
Dialogue#CORIN=uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Instance, briefly; come, instance.
Dialogue#CORIN=Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
Dialogue#CORIN=fells, you know, are greasy.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.
Dialogue#CORIN=Besides, our hands are hard.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=A more sounder instance, come.
Dialogue#CORIN=And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
Dialogue#CORIN=our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
Dialogue#CORIN=courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.
Dialogue#CORIN=You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=God make incision in thee! thou art raw.
Dialogue#CORIN=Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get
Dialogue#CORIN=that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's
Dialogue#CORIN=happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my
Dialogue#CORIN=harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
Dialogue#CORIN=graze and my lambs suck.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=and the rams together and to offer to get your
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=damned for this, the devil himself will have no
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE='scape.

Dialogue#ROSALIND=Let no fair be kept in mind
Dialogue#ROSALIND=But the fair of Rosalind.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the

Dialogue#ROSALIND=Out, fool!
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=For a taste:
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=If a hart do lack a hind,
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Let him seek out Rosalind.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=If the cat will after kind,
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=So be sure will Rosalind.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Winter garments must be lined,
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=So must slender Rosalind.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=They that reap must sheaf and bind;
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Then to cart with Rosalind.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Such a nut is Rosalind.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=He that sweetest rose will find
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Must find love's prick and Rosalind.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=infect yourself with them?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it
Dialogue#ROSALIND=with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit
Dialogue#ROSALIND=i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half
Dialogue#ROSALIND=ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.

Dialogue#CELIA=Didst thou hear these verses?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of
Dialogue#ROSALIND=them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
Dialogue#CELIA=That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear
Dialogue#ROSALIND=themselves without the verse and therefore stood
Dialogue#ROSALIND=lamely in the verse.
Dialogue#CELIA=But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
Dialogue#CELIA=should be hanged and carved upon these trees?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
Dialogue#ROSALIND=before you came; for look here what I found on a
Dialogue#ROSALIND=palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I
Dialogue#ROSALIND=can hardly remember.
Dialogue#CELIA=Trow you who hath done this?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Is it a man?

Dialogue#ROSALIND=I prithee, who?
Dialogue#CELIA=O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to

Dialogue#CELIA=Is it possible?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=tell me who it is.
Dialogue#CELIA=O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
Dialogue#CELIA=wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,
Dialogue#CELIA=out of all hooping!
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
Dialogue#ROSALIND=caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in
Dialogue#ROSALIND=my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
Dialogue#ROSALIND=South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it
Dialogue#ROSALIND=quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst
Dialogue#ROSALIND=stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man
Dialogue#ROSALIND=out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-
Dialogue#ROSALIND=mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at
Dialogue#ROSALIND=all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that
Dialogue#ROSALIND=may drink thy tidings.
Dialogue#CELIA=So you may put a man in your belly.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his
Dialogue#ROSALIND=head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?
Dialogue#CELIA=Nay, he hath but a little beard.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Why, God will send more, if the man will be
Dialogue#ROSALIND=thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if
Dialogue#ROSALIND=thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.

Dialogue#ROSALIND=him again? Answer me in one word.
Dialogue#CELIA=You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a
Dialogue#CELIA=word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To
Dialogue#CELIA=say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
Dialogue#CELIA=answer in a catechism.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
Dialogue#ROSALIND=man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
Dialogue#ROSALIND=day he wrestled?
Dialogue#CELIA=It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the

Dialogue#CELIA=There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well
Dialogue#ROSALIND=becomes the ground.
Dialogue#CELIA=Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
Dialogue#CELIA=unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
Dialogue#CELIA=I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest
Dialogue#CELIA=me out of tune.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must
Dialogue#ROSALIND=speak. Sweet, say on.
Dialogue#CELIA=You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
Notice#Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES
Dialogue#ROSALIND='Tis he: slink by, and note him.
Dialogue#JAQUES=I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had
Dialogue#JAQUES=as lief have been myself alone.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you
Dialogue#ORLANDO=too for your society.
Dialogue#JAQUES=God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I do desire we may be better strangers.
Dialogue#JAQUES=I pray you, mar no more trees with writing
Dialogue#JAQUES=love-songs in their barks.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading
Dialogue#ORLANDO=them ill-favouredly.
Dialogue#JAQUES=Rosalind is your love's name?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Yes, just.
Dialogue#JAQUES=I do not like her name.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
Dialogue#ORLANDO=christened.
Dialogue#JAQUES=What stature is she of?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Just as high as my heart.
Dialogue#JAQUES=You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
Dialogue#JAQUES=acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them
Dialogue#JAQUES=out of rings?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from
Dialogue#ORLANDO=whence you have studied your questions.
Dialogue#JAQUES=You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
Dialogue#JAQUES=Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
Dialogue#JAQUES=we two will rail against our mistress the world and
Dialogue#JAQUES=all our misery.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I will chide no breather in the world but myself,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=against whom I know most faults.
Dialogue#JAQUES=The worst fault you have is to be in love.
Dialogue#ORLANDO='Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I am weary of you.
Dialogue#JAQUES=By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found
Dialogue#JAQUES=you.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you
Dialogue#ORLANDO=shall see him.
Dialogue#JAQUES=There I shall see mine own figure.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
Dialogue#JAQUES=I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good
Dialogue#JAQUES=Signior Love.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Melancholy.
Notice#Exit JAQUES
Dialogue#ROSALIND=[Aside to CELIA]  I will speak to him, like a saucy
Dialogue#ROSALIND=lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Do you hear, forester?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Very well: what would you?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I pray you, what is't o'clock?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
Dialogue#ORLANDO=in the forest.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Then there is no true lover in the forest; else
Dialogue#ROSALIND=sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
Dialogue#ROSALIND=detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
Dialogue#ORLANDO=been as proper?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with
Dialogue#ROSALIND=divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
Dialogue#ROSALIND=withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
Dialogue#ROSALIND=withal and who he stands still withal.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
Dialogue#ROSALIND=contract of her marriage and the day it is
Dialogue#ROSALIND=solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
Dialogue#ROSALIND=seven year.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Who ambles Time withal?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
Dialogue#ROSALIND=hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
Dialogue#ROSALIND=he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
Dialogue#ROSALIND=he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
Dialogue#ROSALIND=and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
Dialogue#ROSALIND=of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Who doth he gallop withal?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as
Dialogue#ROSALIND=softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Who stays it still withal?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between
Dialogue#ROSALIND=term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Where dwell you, pretty youth?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the
Dialogue#ROSALIND=skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Are you native of this place?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Your accent is something finer than you could
Dialogue#ORLANDO=purchase in so removed a dwelling.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
Dialogue#ROSALIND=religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
Dialogue#ROSALIND=in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
Dialogue#ROSALIND=too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
Dialogue#ROSALIND=him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
Dialogue#ROSALIND=giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
Dialogue#ROSALIND=whole sex withal.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
Dialogue#ORLANDO=laid to the charge of women?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=There were none principal; they were all like one
Dialogue#ROSALIND=another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
Dialogue#ROSALIND=monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I prithee, recount some of them.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that
Dialogue#ROSALIND=are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
Dialogue#ROSALIND=abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
Dialogue#ROSALIND=their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
Dialogue#ROSALIND=on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
Dialogue#ROSALIND=give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
Dialogue#ROSALIND=quotidian of love upon him.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
Dialogue#ORLANDO=your remedy.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
Dialogue#ROSALIND=taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
Dialogue#ROSALIND=of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=What were his marks?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and
Dialogue#ROSALIND=sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
Dialogue#ROSALIND=spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for
Dialogue#ROSALIND=simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
Dialogue#ROSALIND=revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
Dialogue#ROSALIND=bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
Dialogue#ROSALIND=untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
Dialogue#ROSALIND=careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
Dialogue#ROSALIND=are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
Dialogue#ROSALIND=loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
Dialogue#ROSALIND=love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to
Dialogue#ROSALIND=do than to confess she does: that is one of the
Dialogue#ROSALIND=points in the which women still give the lie to
Dialogue#ROSALIND=their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
Dialogue#ROSALIND=that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
Dialogue#ROSALIND=is so admired?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves
Dialogue#ROSALIND=as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
Dialogue#ROSALIND=the reason why they are not so punished and cured
Dialogue#ROSALIND=is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
Dialogue#ROSALIND=are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Did you ever cure any so?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me
Dialogue#ROSALIND=his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to
Dialogue#ROSALIND=woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
Dialogue#ROSALIND=youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
Dialogue#ROSALIND=and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
Dialogue#ROSALIND=passion something and for no passion truly any
Dialogue#ROSALIND=thing, as boys and women are for the most part
Dialogue#ROSALIND=cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe
Dialogue#ROSALIND=him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep
Dialogue#ROSALIND=for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor
Dialogue#ROSALIND=from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
Dialogue#ROSALIND=madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of
Dialogue#ROSALIND=the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
Dialogue#ROSALIND=me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
Dialogue#ROSALIND=heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I would not be cured, youth.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind
Dialogue#ROSALIND=and come every day to my cote and woo me.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
Dialogue#ORLANDO=where it is.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
Dialogue#ROSALIND=you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Will you go?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=With all my heart, good youth.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?

Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=doth my simple feature content you?
Dialogue#AUDREY=Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
Dialogue#JAQUES=[Aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove
Dialogue#JAQUES=in a thatched house!
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=man's good wit seconded with the forward child
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=the gods had made thee poetical.
Dialogue#AUDREY=I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
Dialogue#AUDREY=deed and word? is it a true thing?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
Dialogue#AUDREY=Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=hope thou didst feign.
Dialogue#AUDREY=Would you not have me honest?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
Dialogue#JAQUES=[Aside]  A material fool!
Dialogue#AUDREY= Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods
Dialogue#AUDREY=make me honest.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=were to put good meat into an unclean dish.
Dialogue#AUDREY=I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=village, who hath promised to meet me in this place
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=of the forest and to couple us.
Dialogue#JAQUES=[Aside]  I would fain see this meeting.
Dialogue#AUDREY=Well, the gods give us joy!
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=want. Here comes Sir Oliver.
Notice#Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT

Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=with you to your chapel?

Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=I will not take her on gift of any man.
Dialogue#SIR OLIVER MARTEXT=Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
Dialogue#JAQUES=[Advancing]
Dialogue#JAQUES=Proceed, proceed	I'll give her.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=last company: I am very glad to see you: even a
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.
Dialogue#JAQUES=Will you be married, motley?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
Dialogue#JAQUES=And will you, being a man of your breeding, be
Dialogue#JAQUES=married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
Dialogue#JAQUES=church, and have a good priest that can tell you
Dialogue#JAQUES=what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
Dialogue#JAQUES=together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
Dialogue#JAQUES=prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=[Aside]  I am not in the mind but I were better to be
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=married of him than of another: for he is not like
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=to marry me well; and not being well married, it
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.
Dialogue#JAQUES=Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE='Come, sweet Audrey:
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.

Dialogue#ROSALIND=But have I not cause to weep?
Dialogue#CELIA=As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
Dialogue#CELIA=Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are
Dialogue#CELIA=Judas's own children.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
Dialogue#CELIA=An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
Dialogue#ROSALIND=of holy bread.
Dialogue#CELIA=He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
Dialogue#CELIA=of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;
Dialogue#CELIA=the very ice of chastity is in them.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
Dialogue#ROSALIND=comes not?
Dialogue#CELIA=Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Do you think so?
Dialogue#CELIA=Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
Dialogue#CELIA=horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
Dialogue#CELIA=think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
Dialogue#CELIA=worm-eaten nut.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Not true in love?
Dialogue#CELIA=Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=You have heard him swear downright he was.
Dialogue#CELIA='Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is
Dialogue#CELIA=no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are
Dialogue#CELIA=both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
Dialogue#CELIA=here in the forest on the duke your father.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
Dialogue#ROSALIND=him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told
Dialogue#ROSALIND=him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
Dialogue#ROSALIND=man as Orlando?
Dialogue#CELIA=O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,
Dialogue#CELIA=speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
Dialogue#CELIA=them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
Dialogue#CELIA=his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse

Dialogue#PHEBE=Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
Dialogue#PHEBE=Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
Dialogue#PHEBE=Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
Dialogue#PHEBE=Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
Dialogue#PHEBE=Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
Dialogue#PHEBE=Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,
Dialogue#PHEBE=The cicatrice and capable impressure
Dialogue#PHEBE=Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
Dialogue#PHEBE=Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
Dialogue#PHEBE=Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes
Dialogue#PHEBE=That can do hurt.

Dialogue#ROSALIND=As, by my faith, I see no more in you
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Than without candle may go dark to bed--
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I see no more in you than in the ordinary
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,

Dialogue#ROSALIND='Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,

Dialogue#PHEBE=Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:
Dialogue#PHEBE=I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
Dialogue#ROSALIND=fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as
Dialogue#ROSALIND=she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her
Dialogue#ROSALIND=with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?
Dialogue#PHEBE=For no ill will I bear you.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I pray you, do not fall in love with me,

Dialogue#SILVIUS=That the old carlot once was master of.
Dialogue#PHEBE=Think not I love him, though I ask for him:
Dialogue#PHEBE='Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
Dialogue#PHEBE=But what care I for words? yet words do well
Dialogue#PHEBE=When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
Dialogue#PHEBE=It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
Dialogue#PHEBE=But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:
Dialogue#PHEBE=He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
Dialogue#PHEBE=Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
Dialogue#PHEBE=Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
Dialogue#PHEBE=He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
Dialogue#PHEBE=His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
Dialogue#PHEBE=There was a pretty redness in his lip,
Dialogue#PHEBE=A little riper and more lusty red
Dialogue#PHEBE=Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
Dialogue#PHEBE=Between the constant red and mingled damask.
Dialogue#PHEBE=There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
Dialogue#PHEBE=In parcels as I did, would have gone near
Dialogue#PHEBE=To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
Dialogue#PHEBE=I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
Dialogue#PHEBE=I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
Dialogue#PHEBE=For what had he to do to chide at me?
Dialogue#PHEBE=He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
Dialogue#PHEBE=And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:
Dialogue#PHEBE=I marvel why I answer'd not again:
Dialogue#PHEBE=But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.
Dialogue#PHEBE=I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
Dialogue#PHEBE=And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?
Dialogue#SILVIUS=Phebe, with all my heart.
Dialogue#PHEBE=I'll write it straight;
Dialogue#PHEBE=The matter's in my head and in my heart:
Dialogue#PHEBE=I will be bitter with him and passing short.
Dialogue#PHEBE=Go with me, Silvius.

Notice#Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES
Dialogue#JAQUES=I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted
Dialogue#JAQUES=with thee.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=They say you are a melancholy fellow.
Dialogue#JAQUES=I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
Dialogue#ROSALIND=fellows and betray themselves to every modern
Dialogue#ROSALIND=censure worse than drunkards.
Dialogue#JAQUES=Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
Dialogue#JAQUES=I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
Dialogue#JAQUES=emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,
Dialogue#JAQUES=nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the
Dialogue#JAQUES=soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,
Dialogue#JAQUES=which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor
Dialogue#JAQUES=the lover's, which is all these: but it is a
Dialogue#JAQUES=melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,
Dialogue#JAQUES=extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's
Dialogue#JAQUES=contemplation of my travels, in which my often
Dialogue#JAQUES=rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to
Dialogue#ROSALIND=be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see
Dialogue#ROSALIND=other men's; then, to have seen much and to have
Dialogue#ROSALIND=nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
Dialogue#JAQUES=Yes, I have gained my experience.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have
Dialogue#ROSALIND=a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
Dialogue#ROSALIND=sad; and to travel for it too!

Dialogue#ORLANDO=Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!
Dialogue#JAQUES=Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and
Dialogue#ROSALIND=wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your
Dialogue#ROSALIND=own country, be out of love with your nativity and
Dialogue#ROSALIND=almost chide God for making you that countenance you
Dialogue#ROSALIND=are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a
Dialogue#ROSALIND=gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been
Dialogue#ROSALIND=all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
Dialogue#ROSALIND=another trick, never come in my sight more.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Break an hour's promise in love! He that will
Dialogue#ROSALIND=divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
Dialogue#ROSALIND=a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
Dialogue#ROSALIND=affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid
Dialogue#ROSALIND=hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant
Dialogue#ROSALIND=him heart-whole.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I
Dialogue#ROSALIND=had as lief be wooed of a snail.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Of a snail?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he
Dialogue#ROSALIND=carries his house on his head; a better jointure,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings
Dialogue#ROSALIND=his destiny with him.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=What's that?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be
Dialogue#ROSALIND=beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in
Dialogue#ROSALIND=his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=And I am your Rosalind.
Dialogue#CELIA=It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a
Dialogue#CELIA=Rosalind of a better leer than you.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday
Dialogue#ROSALIND=humour and like enough to consent. What would you
Dialogue#ROSALIND=say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I would kiss before I spoke.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were
Dialogue#ROSALIND=gravelled for lack of matter, you might take
Dialogue#ROSALIND=occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are
Dialogue#ROSALIND=out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God
Dialogue#ROSALIND=warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=How if the kiss be denied?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=What, of my suit?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Am not I your Rosalind?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I take some joy to say you are, because I would be
Dialogue#ORLANDO=talking of her.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Well in her person I say I will not have you.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Then in mine own person I die.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is
Dialogue#ROSALIND=almost six thousand years old, and in all this time
Dialogue#ROSALIND=there was not any man died in his own person,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains
Dialogue#ROSALIND=dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
Dialogue#ROSALIND=could to die before, and he is one of the patterns
Dialogue#ROSALIND=of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair
Dialogue#ROSALIND=year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been
Dialogue#ROSALIND=for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went
Dialogue#ROSALIND=but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
Dialogue#ROSALIND=taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
Dialogue#ROSALIND=coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'
Dialogue#ROSALIND=But these are all lies: men have died from time to
Dialogue#ROSALIND=time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,
Dialogue#ORLANDO=for, I protest, her frown might kill me.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
Dialogue#ROSALIND=disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant
Dialogue#ROSALIND=it.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Then love me, Rosalind.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=And wilt thou have me?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Ay, and twenty such.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=What sayest thou?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Are you not good?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I hope so.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Pray thee, marry us.
Dialogue#CELIA=I cannot say the words.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'
Dialogue#CELIA=Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I will.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Ay, but when?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Why now; as fast as she can marry us.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I might ask you for your commission; but I do take
Dialogue#ROSALIND=thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes
Dialogue#ROSALIND=before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought
Dialogue#ROSALIND=runs before her actions.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=So do all thoughts; they are winged.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Now tell me how long you would have her after you
Dialogue#ROSALIND=have possessed her.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=For ever and a day.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;
Dialogue#ROSALIND=men are April when they woo, December when they wed:
Dialogue#ROSALIND=maids are May when they are maids, but the sky
Dialogue#ROSALIND=changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
Dialogue#ROSALIND=of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more
Dialogue#ROSALIND=new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires
Dialogue#ROSALIND=than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana
Dialogue#ROSALIND=in the fountain, and I will do that when you are
Dialogue#ROSALIND=disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and
Dialogue#ROSALIND=that when thou art inclined to sleep.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=But will my Rosalind do so?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=By my life, she will do as I do.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=O, but she is wise.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
Dialogue#ROSALIND=wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's
Dialogue#ROSALIND=wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and
Dialogue#ROSALIND='twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly
Dialogue#ROSALIND=with the smoke out at the chimney.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say
Dialogue#ORLANDO='Wit, whither wilt?'
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met
Dialogue#ROSALIND=your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall
Dialogue#ROSALIND=never take her without her answer, unless you take
Dialogue#ROSALIND=her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot
Dialogue#ROSALIND=make her fault her husband's occasion, let her
Dialogue#ROSALIND=never nurse her child herself, for she will breed
Dialogue#ROSALIND=it like a fool!
Dialogue#ORLANDO=For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I
Dialogue#ORLANDO=will be with thee again.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you
Dialogue#ROSALIND=would prove: my friends told me as much, and I
Dialogue#ROSALIND=thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
Dialogue#ROSALIND=won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=death! Two o'clock is your hour?
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Ay, sweet Rosalind.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend
Dialogue#ROSALIND=me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=if you break one jot of your promise or come one
Dialogue#ROSALIND=minute behind your hour, I will think you the most
Dialogue#ROSALIND=pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
Dialogue#ROSALIND=and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
Dialogue#ROSALIND=may be chosen out of the gross band of the
Dialogue#ROSALIND=unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep
Dialogue#ROSALIND=your promise.
Dialogue#ORLANDO=With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
Dialogue#ORLANDO=Rosalind: so adieu.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
Dialogue#ROSALIND=offenders, and let Time try: adieu.
Notice#Exit ORLANDO
Dialogue#CELIA=You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:
Dialogue#CELIA=we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
Dialogue#CELIA=head, and show the world what the bird hath done to
Dialogue#CELIA=her own nest.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
Dialogue#ROSALIND=didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
Dialogue#ROSALIND=it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
Dialogue#ROSALIND=bottom, like the bay of Portugal.
Dialogue#CELIA=Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour
Dialogue#CELIA=affection in, it runs out.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
Dialogue#ROSALIND=of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
Dialogue#ROSALIND=because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I
Dialogue#ROSALIND=am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out
Dialogue#ROSALIND=of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and
Dialogue#ROSALIND=sigh till he come.

Dialogue#JAQUES=conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's
Dialogue#JAQUES=horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have
Dialogue#JAQUES=you no song, forester, for this purpose?
Dialogue#Forester=Yes, sir.
Dialogue#JAQUES=Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it

Dialogue#JAQUES=SONG.
Dialogue#Forester=What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
Dialogue#Forester=His leather skin and horns to wear.
Dialogue#Forester=Then sing him home;
Notice#The rest shall bear this burden
Dialogue#Forester=Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;

Dialogue#SILVIUS=I know not the contents; but, as I guess
Dialogue#SILVIUS=By the stern brow and waspish action
Dialogue#SILVIUS=Which she did use as she was writing of it,
Dialogue#SILVIUS=It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
Dialogue#SILVIUS=I am but as a guiltless messenger.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Patience herself would startle at this letter
Dialogue#ROSALIND=And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
Dialogue#ROSALIND=She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
Dialogue#ROSALIND=She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=This is a letter of your own device.
Dialogue#SILVIUS=No, I protest, I know not the contents:
Dialogue#SILVIUS=Phebe did write it.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Come, come, you are a fool
Dialogue#ROSALIND=And turn'd into the extremity of love.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
Dialogue#ROSALIND=That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:
Dialogue#ROSALIND=She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
Dialogue#ROSALIND=I say she never did invent this letter;
Dialogue#ROSALIND=This is a man's invention and his hand.
Dialogue#SILVIUS=Sure, it is hers.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
Dialogue#SILVIUS=So please you, for I never heard it yet;
Dialogue#SILVIUS=Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.

Dialogue#ROSALIND=Did you ever hear such railing?
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=That could do no vengeance to me.

Dialogue#OLIVER=Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age
Dialogue#OLIVER=And high top bald with dry antiquity,
Dialogue#OLIVER=A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
Dialogue#OLIVER=Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
Dialogue#OLIVER=A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
Dialogue#OLIVER=Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
Dialogue#OLIVER=The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
Dialogue#OLIVER=Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
Dialogue#OLIVER=And with indented glides did slip away
Dialogue#OLIVER=Into a bush: under which bush's shade
Dialogue#OLIVER=A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,

Dialogue#OLIVER=When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
Dialogue#OLIVER=The royal disposition of that beast
Dialogue#OLIVER=To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:
Dialogue#OLIVER=This seen, Orlando did approach the man
Dialogue#OLIVER=And found it was his brother, his elder brother.

Dialogue#CELIA=And he did render him the most unnatural
Dialogue#CELIA=That lived amongst men.

Dialogue#OLIVER=For well I know he was unnatural.
Dialogue#ROSALIND=But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
Dialogue#ROSALIND=Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
Dialogue#OLIVER=Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;
Dialogue#OLIVER=But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
Dialogue#OLIVER=And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
Dialogue#OLIVER=Made him give battle to the lioness,
Dialogue#OLIVER=Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
Dialogue#OLIVER=From miserable slumber I awaked.
Dialogue#CELIA=Are you his brother?

Dialogue#OLIVER=As how I came into that desert place:--
Dialogue#OLIVER=In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
Dialogue#OLIVER=Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
Dialogue#OLIVER=Committing me unto my brother's love;
Dialogue#OLIVER=Who led me instantly unto his cave,
Dialogue#OLIVER=There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
Dialogue#OLIVER=The lioness had torn some flesh away,
Dialogue#OLIVER=Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted
Dialogue#OLIVER=And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
Dialogue#OLIVER=Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;

Dialogue#JAQUES=Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the
Dialogue#JAQUES=motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in
Dialogue#JAQUES=the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=If any man doubt that, let him put me to my
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.
Dialogue#JAQUES=And how was that ta'en up?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=seventh cause.
Dialogue#JAQUES=How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.

Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I

Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.
Dialogue#DUKE SENIOR=By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.
Dialogue#JAQUES=But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the
Dialogue#JAQUES=quarrel on the seventh cause?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=would send me word, he cut it to please himself:
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
Dialogue#JAQUES=And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=measured swords and parted.
Dialogue#JAQUES=Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=parties were met themselves, one of them thought but
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the
Dialogue#TOUCHSTONE=only peacemaker; much virtue in If.
Dialogue#JAQUES=Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at
