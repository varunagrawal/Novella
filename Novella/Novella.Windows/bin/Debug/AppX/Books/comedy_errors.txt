Notice:Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants
Dialogue:AEGEON=Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall
Dialogue:AEGEON=And by the doom of death end woes and all.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=I am not partial to infringe our laws:
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=The enmity and discord which of late
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=For, since the mortal and intestine jars
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS='Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=It hath in solemn synods been decreed
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=If any born at Ephesus be seen
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Again: if any Syracusian born
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Unless a thousand marks be levied,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.
Dialogue:AEGEON=Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
Dialogue:AEGEON=My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Why thou departed'st from thy native home
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.
Dialogue:AEGEON=A heavier task could not have been imposed
Dialogue:AEGEON=Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
Dialogue:AEGEON=Yet, that the world may witness that my end
Dialogue:AEGEON=Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
Dialogue:AEGEON=I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
Dialogue:AEGEON=In Syracusa was I born, and wed
Dialogue:AEGEON=Unto a woman, happy but for me,
Dialogue:AEGEON=And by me, had not our hap been bad.
Dialogue:AEGEON=With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
Dialogue:AEGEON=By prosperous voyages I often made
Dialogue:AEGEON=To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
Dialogue:AEGEON=And the great care of goods at random left
Dialogue:AEGEON=Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
Dialogue:AEGEON=From whom my absence was not six months old
Dialogue:AEGEON=Before herself, almost at fainting under
Dialogue:AEGEON=The pleasing punishment that women bear,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Had made provision for her following me
Dialogue:AEGEON=And soon and safe arrived where I was.
Dialogue:AEGEON=There had she not been long, but she became
Dialogue:AEGEON=A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
Dialogue:AEGEON=And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
Dialogue:AEGEON=As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
Dialogue:AEGEON=That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
Dialogue:AEGEON=A meaner woman was delivered
Dialogue:AEGEON=Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
Dialogue:AEGEON=Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
Dialogue:AEGEON=I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
Dialogue:AEGEON=My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Made daily motions for our home return:
Dialogue:AEGEON=Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
Dialogue:AEGEON=We came aboard.
Dialogue:AEGEON=A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Before the always wind-obeying deep
Dialogue:AEGEON=Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
Dialogue:AEGEON=But longer did we not retain much hope;
Dialogue:AEGEON=For what obscured light the heavens did grant
Dialogue:AEGEON=Did but convey unto our fearful minds
Dialogue:AEGEON=A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
Dialogue:AEGEON=Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Weeping before for what she saw must come,
Dialogue:AEGEON=And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
Dialogue:AEGEON=That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
Dialogue:AEGEON=And this it was, for other means was none:
Dialogue:AEGEON=The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
Dialogue:AEGEON=And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
Dialogue:AEGEON=My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
Dialogue:AEGEON=To him one of the other twins was bound,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
Dialogue:AEGEON=The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
Dialogue:AEGEON=And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
Dialogue:AEGEON=At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
Dialogue:AEGEON=And by the benefit of his wished light,
Dialogue:AEGEON=The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
Dialogue:AEGEON=Two ships from far making amain to us,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
Dialogue:AEGEON=But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
Dialogue:AEGEON=Gather the sequel by that went before.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
Dialogue:AEGEON=O, had the gods done so, I had not now
Dialogue:AEGEON=Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
Dialogue:AEGEON=For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
Dialogue:AEGEON=We were encounterd by a mighty rock;
Dialogue:AEGEON=Which being violently borne upon,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
Dialogue:AEGEON=So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Fortune had left to both of us alike
Dialogue:AEGEON=What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
Dialogue:AEGEON=Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
Dialogue:AEGEON=With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Was carried with more speed before the wind;
Dialogue:AEGEON=And in our sight they three were taken up
Dialogue:AEGEON=By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
Dialogue:AEGEON=At length, another ship had seized on us;
Dialogue:AEGEON=And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
Dialogue:AEGEON=And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
Dialogue:AEGEON=And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
Dialogue:AEGEON=Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
Dialogue:AEGEON=That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
Dialogue:AEGEON=To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Do me the favour to dilate at full
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
Dialogue:AEGEON=My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
Dialogue:AEGEON=At eighteen years became inquisitive
Dialogue:AEGEON=After his brother: and importuned me
Dialogue:AEGEON=That his attendant--so his case was like,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
Dialogue:AEGEON=Might bear him company in the quest of him:
Dialogue:AEGEON=Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,
Dialogue:AEGEON=I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
Dialogue:AEGEON=Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
Dialogue:AEGEON=And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
Dialogue:AEGEON=Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
Dialogue:AEGEON=Or that or any place that harbours men.
Dialogue:AEGEON=But here must end the story of my life;
Dialogue:AEGEON=And happy were I in my timely death,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Could all my travels warrant me they live.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=My soul would sue as advocate for thee.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=But, though thou art adjudged to the death
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=And passed sentence may not be recall'd
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=But to our honour's great disparagement,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=To seek thy life by beneficial help:
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Gaoler, take him to thy custody.
Dialogue:Gaoler=I will, my lord.
Dialogue:AEGEON=Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,
Dialogue:AEGEON=But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

Dialogue:ADRIANA=Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
Dialogue:LUCIANA=And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
Dialogue:LUCIANA=A man is master of his liberty:
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Time is their master, and, when they see time,
Dialogue:LUCIANA=They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Why should their liberty than ours be more?
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Because their business still lies out o' door.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
Dialogue:LUCIANA=O, know he is the bridle of your will.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=There's none but asses will be bridled so.
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
Dialogue:LUCIANA=There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
Dialogue:LUCIANA=But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
Dialogue:LUCIANA=The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Are their males' subjects and at their controls:

Dialogue:LUCIANA=Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Are masters to their females, and their lords:
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Then let your will attend on their accords.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=How if your husband start some other where?
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Till he come home again, I would forbear.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;

Dialogue:ADRIANA=A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
Dialogue:ADRIANA=But were we burdened with like weight of pain,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=As much or more would we ourselves complain:
Dialogue:ADRIANA=So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.

Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his

Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=understand them.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he

Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Horn-mad, thou villain!
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=I mean not cuckold-mad;

Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Go back again, and be new beaten home?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=For God's sake, send some other messenger.

Dialogue:ADRIANA=From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
Dialogue:ADRIANA=If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Do their gay vestments his affections bait?

Dialogue:ADRIANA=A sunny look of his would soon repair
Dialogue:ADRIANA=But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
Dialogue:ADRIANA=And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.

Dialogue:ADRIANA=Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,

Dialogue:ADRIANA=I see the jewel best enamelled
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,

Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
Notice:Beating him
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Upon what bargain do you give it me?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Because that I familiarly sometimes
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Your sauciness will jest upon my love
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=And make a common of my serious hours.
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Dost thou not know?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Shall I tell you why?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=a wherefore.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=For urging it the second time to me.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=nor reason?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Well, sir, I thank you.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Thank me, sir, for what?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=In good time, sir; what's that?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Basting.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Your reason?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=dry basting.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=time for all things.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=By what rule, sir?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=pate of father Time himself.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Let's hear it.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=grows bald by nature.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=May he not do it by fine and recovery?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=lost hair of another man.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=so plentiful an excrement?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=it in a kind of jollity.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=For what reason?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=For two; and sound ones too.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Nay, not sound, I pray you.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Sure ones, then.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Certain ones then.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Name them.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=The one, to save the money that he spends in
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=drop in his porridge.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=You would all this time have proved there is no
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=time for all things.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=lost by nature.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=But your reason was not substantial, why there is no
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=time to recover.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=to the world's end will have bald followers.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=But, soft! who wafts us yonder?
Notice:Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
Dialogue:ADRIANA=I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
Dialogue:ADRIANA=That never words were music to thine ear,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=That never object pleasing in thine eye,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=That, undividable, incorporate,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Am better than thy dear self's better part.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
Dialogue:ADRIANA=For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
Dialogue:ADRIANA=A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=And take unmingled that same drop again,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Without addition or diminishing,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=As take from me thyself and not me too.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
Dialogue:ADRIANA=And that this body, consecrate to thee,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
Dialogue:ADRIANA=And hurl the name of husband in my face
Dialogue:ADRIANA=And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
Dialogue:ADRIANA=And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
Dialogue:ADRIANA=And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
Dialogue:ADRIANA=I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
Dialogue:ADRIANA=My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
Dialogue:ADRIANA=For if we too be one and thou play false,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
Dialogue:ADRIANA=I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=As strange unto your town as to your talk;
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Want wit in all one word to understand.
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!
Dialogue:LUCIANA=When were you wont to use my sister thus?
Dialogue:LUCIANA=She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
Dialogue:LUCIANA=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=By Dromio?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=By me?
Dialogue:ADRIANA=By thee; and this thou didst return from him,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=What is the course and drift of your compact?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=I, sir? I never saw her till this time.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=I never spake with her in all my life.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=How can she thus then call us by our names,
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Unless it be by inspiration.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=How ill agrees it with your gravity
Dialogue:ADRIANA=To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
Dialogue:ADRIANA=If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=What, was I married to her in my dream?
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Until I know this sure uncertainty,
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=If we obey them not, this will ensue,
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=I am transformed, master, am I not?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Thou hast thine own form.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=No, I am an ape.
Dialogue:LUCIANA=If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE='Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE='Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=But I should know her as well as she knows me.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=To put the finger in the eye and weep,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day
Dialogue:ADRIANA=And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=I'll say as they say and persever so,
Dialogue:OF SYRACUSE=And in this mist at all adventures go.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.

Dialogue:LUCIANA=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=To see the making of her carcanet,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=But here's a villain that would face me down
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=And that I did deny my wife and house.
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=I think thou art an ass.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Marry, so it doth appear
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your

Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!

Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=for such store,
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=What patch is made our porter? My master stays in
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=the street.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=[Within]  Let him walk from whence he came, lest he

Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=name for an ass.
Dialogue:LUCE=[Within]  What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those
Dialogue:LUCE=at the gate?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Let my master in, Luce.
Dialogue:LUCE=[Within]  Faith, no; he comes too late;
Dialogue:LUCE=And so tell your master.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=O Lord, I must laugh!
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?
Dialogue:LUCE=[Within]  Have at you with another; that's--When?
Dialogue:LUCE=can you tell?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=[Within]  If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hast
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=answered him well.
Dialogue:ANTIPHOLUS=Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?
Dialogue:ANTIPHOLUS=OF EPHESUS
Dialogue:LUCE=[Within]  I thought to have asked you.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=[Within]  And you said no.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Thou baggage, let me in.
Dialogue:LUCE=[Within]  Can you tell for whose sake?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Master, knock the door hard.
Dialogue:LUCE=[Within]  Let him knock till it ache.
Dialogue:LUCE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.
Dialogue:LUCE=[Within]  What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?
Dialogue:ADRIANA=[Within]  Who is that at the door that keeps all
Dialogue:ADRIANA=this noise?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=[Within]  By my troth, your town is troubled with
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=unruly boys.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Are you there, wife? you might have come before.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=[Within]  Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.
Dialogue:ANGELO=Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would
Dialogue:ANGELO=fain have either.
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=[Within]  Break any breaking here, and I'll break your

Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF SYRACUSE=[Within]  It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon

Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=Herein you war against your reputation

Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=Why at this time the doors are made against you.
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=And about evening come yourself alone
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=To know the reason of this strange restraint.
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=If by strong hand you offer to break in
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=Now in the stirring passage of the day,
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=A vulgar comment will be made of it,
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=And that supposed by the common rout
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=Against your yet ungalled estimation
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=That may with foul intrusion enter in
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=For slander lives upon succession,
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=For ever housed where it gets possession.
Dialogue:BALTHAZAR=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=I know a wench of excellent discourse,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=My wife--but, I protest, without desert--
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=To her will we to dinner.
Notice:To Angelo
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Get you home
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.
Dialogue:ANGELO=I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
Dialogue:ANGELO=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.

Dialogue:LUCIANA=Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
Dialogue:LUCIANA=If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Let not my sister read it in your eye;
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;

Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=At your important letters,--this ill day
Dialogue:ADRIANA=A most outrageous fit of madness took him;
Dialogue:ADRIANA=That desperately he hurried through the street,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=With him his bondman, all as mad as he--
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Doing displeasure to the citizens
Dialogue:ADRIANA=By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=That here and there his fury had committed.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=He broke from those that had the guard of him;
Dialogue:ADRIANA=And with his mad attendant and himself,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Met us again and madly bent on us,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=We came again to bind them. Then they fled
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:
Dialogue:ADRIANA=And here the abbess shuts the gates on us
Dialogue:ADRIANA=And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=To do him all the grace and good I could.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=And bid the lady abbess come to me.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=I will determine this before I stir.

Dialogue:Servant=O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
Dialogue:Servant=My master and his man are both broke loose,
Dialogue:Servant=Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor
Dialogue:Servant=Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;
Dialogue:Servant=And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him
Dialogue:Servant=Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:
Dialogue:Servant=My master preaches patience to him and the while
Dialogue:Servant=His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,
Dialogue:Servant=And sure, unless you send some present help,
Dialogue:Servant=Between them they will kill the conjurer.
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
Dialogue:ADRIANA=And that is false thou dost report to us.
Dialogue:Servant=Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
Dialogue:Servant=I have not breathed almost since I did see it.
Dialogue:Servant=He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
Dialogue:Servant=To scorch your face and to disfigure you.
Notice:Cry within
Dialogue:Servant=Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!
Dialogue:ADRIANA=Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,

Dialogue:ADRIANA=And now he's there, past thought of human reason.

Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=That hath abused and dishonour'd me
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Even in the strength and height of injury!
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Beyond imagination is the wrong
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=While she with harlots feasted in my house.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?
Dialogue:ADRIANA=No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister
Dialogue:ADRIANA=To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
Dialogue:ADRIANA=As this is false he burdens me withal!
Dialogue:LUCIANA=Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,
Dialogue:LUCIANA=But she tells to your highness simple truth!
Dialogue:ANGELO=O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
Dialogue:ANGELO=In this the madman justly chargeth them.
Dialogue:ANGELO=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=My liege, I am advised what I say,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Could witness it, for he was with me then;
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=I went to seek him: in the street I met him
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=And in his company that gentleman.
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=That I this day of him received the chain,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=He did arrest me with an officer.
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=I did obey, and sent my peasant home
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=For certain ducats: he with none return'd
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Then fairly I bespoke the officer
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=To go in person with me to my house.
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=By the way we met
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Of vile confederates. Along with them
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=And in a dark and dankish vault at home
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=There left me and my man, both bound together;
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=To give me ample satisfaction
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=For these deep shames and great indignities.
Dialogue:ANGELO=My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
Dialogue:ANGELO=That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=But had he such a chain of thee or no?
Dialogue:ANGELO=He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
Dialogue:ANGELO=These people saw the chain about his neck.
Dialogue:Second Merchant=Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
Dialogue:Second Merchant=Heard you confess you had the chain of him
Dialogue:Second Merchant=After you first forswore it on the mart:
Dialogue:Second Merchant=And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
Dialogue:Second Merchant=And then you fled into this abbey here,
Dialogue:Second Merchant=From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
Dialogue:Second Merchant=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=I never came within these abbey-walls,
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=And this is false you burden me withal.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=If here you housed him, here he would have been;
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.
Dialogue:Courtezan=He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
Dialogue:Courtezan=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS='Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
Dialogue:Courtezan=As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.

Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
Dialogue:AEGEON=Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
Dialogue:AEGEON=And is not that your bondman, Dromio?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Within this hour I was his bondman sir,
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.
Dialogue:AEGEON=I am sure you both of you remember me.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=For lately we were bound, as you are now
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?
Dialogue:AEGEON=Why look you strange on me? you know me well.
Dialogue:ANTIPHOLUS=I never saw you in my life till now.
Dialogue:AEGEON=O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
Dialogue:AEGEON=And careful hours with time's deformed hand
Dialogue:AEGEON=Have written strange defeatures in my face:
Dialogue:AEGEON=But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
Dialogue:AEGEON=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Neither.
Dialogue:AEGEON=Dromio, nor thou?
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=                  No, trust me, sir, nor I.
Dialogue:AEGEON=I am sure thou dost.
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a
Dialogue:DROMIO OF EPHESUS=man denies, you are now bound to believe him.
Dialogue:AEGEON=Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
Dialogue:AEGEON=In seven short years, that here my only son
Dialogue:AEGEON=Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
Dialogue:AEGEON=Though now this grained face of mine be hid
Dialogue:AEGEON=In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
Dialogue:AEGEON=And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Yet hath my night of life some memory,
Dialogue:AEGEON=My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
Dialogue:AEGEON=My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:
Dialogue:AEGEON=All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
Dialogue:AEGEON=Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
Dialogue:AEGEON=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=I never saw my father in my life.
Dialogue:AEGEON=But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,
Dialogue:AEGEON=Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.
Dialogue:AEGEON=ANTIPHOLUS
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=The duke and all that know me in the city
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=Can witness with me that it is not so
Dialogue:OF EPHESUS=I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.
Dialogue:DUKE SOLINUS=I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
