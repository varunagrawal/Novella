Notice:Enter two Gentlemen
Dialogue:First Gentleman=You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods
Dialogue:First Gentleman=No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Still seem as does the king.
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=But what's the matter?
Dialogue:First Gentleman=His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
Dialogue:First Gentleman=He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow
Dialogue:First Gentleman=That late he married--hath referr'd herself
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Is outward sorrow; though I think the king
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Be touch'd at very heart.
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=None but the king?
Dialogue:First Gentleman=He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=That most desired the match; but not a courtier,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Although they wear their faces to the bent
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Glad at the thing they scowl at.
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=And why so?
Dialogue:First Gentleman=He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--
Dialogue:First Gentleman=I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
Dialogue:First Gentleman=And therefore banish'd--is a creature such
Dialogue:First Gentleman=As, to seek through the regions of the earth
Dialogue:First Gentleman=For one his like, there would be something failing
Dialogue:First Gentleman=In him that should compare. I do not think
Dialogue:First Gentleman=So fair an outward and such stuff within
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Endows a man but he.
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=You speak him far.
Dialogue:First Gentleman=I do extend him, sir, within himself,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Crush him together rather than unfold
Dialogue:First Gentleman=His measure duly.
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=                  What's his name and birth?
Dialogue:First Gentleman=I cannot delve him to the root: his father
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=But had his titles by Tenantius whom
Dialogue:First Gentleman=He served with glory and admired success,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
Dialogue:First Gentleman=And had, besides this gentleman in question,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Died with their swords in hand; for which
Dialogue:First Gentleman=their father,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
Dialogue:First Gentleman=That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased
Dialogue:First Gentleman=As he was born. The king he takes the babe
Dialogue:First Gentleman=To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Puts to him all the learnings that his time
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=A sample to the youngest, to the more mature
Dialogue:First Gentleman=A glass that feated them, and to the graver
Dialogue:First Gentleman=A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
Dialogue:First Gentleman=By her election may be truly read
Dialogue:First Gentleman=What kind of man he is.
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=I honour him
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=Is she sole child to the king?
Dialogue:First Gentleman=His only child.
Dialogue:First Gentleman=He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Which way they went.
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=How long is this ago?
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Some twenty years.
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=That a king's children should be so convey'd,
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=That could not trace them!
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Yet is it true, sir.
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=I do well believe you.
Dialogue:First Gentleman=We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,
Dialogue:First Gentleman=The queen, and princess.

Dialogue:QUEEN=No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,
Dialogue:QUEEN=After the slander of most stepmothers,
Dialogue:QUEEN=Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but
Dialogue:QUEEN=Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
Dialogue:QUEEN=That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
Dialogue:QUEEN=So soon as I can win the offended king,
Dialogue:QUEEN=I will be known your advocate: marry, yet
Dialogue:QUEEN=The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
Dialogue:QUEEN=You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
Dialogue:QUEEN=Your wisdom may inform you.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Please your highness,
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=I will from hence to-day.
Dialogue:QUEEN=You know the peril.
Dialogue:QUEEN=I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
Dialogue:QUEEN=The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king
Dialogue:QUEEN=Hath charged you should not speak together.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:IMOGEN=O
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Always reserved my holy duty--what
Dialogue:IMOGEN=His rage can do on me: you must be gone;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And I shall here abide the hourly shot
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=But that there is this jewel in the world
Dialogue:IMOGEN=That I may see again.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=My queen! my mistress!
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=To be suspected of more tenderness
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Than doth become a man. I will remain
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:

Dialogue:QUEEN=How much of his displeasure.

Dialogue:QUEEN=Pays dear for my offences.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Should we be taking leave
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=As long a term as yet we have to live,
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Nay, stay a little:
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=But keep it till you woo another wife,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=When Imogen is dead.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=How, how! another?
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=And sear up my embracements from a next
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=With bonds of death!
Notice:Putting on the ring
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Remain, remain thou here

Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles

Notice:Exit
Dialogue:IMOGEN=                  There cannot be a pinch in death
Dialogue:IMOGEN=More sharp than this is.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=O disloyal thing,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=A year's age on me.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I beseech you, sir,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Harm not yourself with your vexation
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Subdues all pangs, all fears.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Past grace? obedience?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
Dialogue:IMOGEN=O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And did avoid a puttock.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=A seat for baseness.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=No; I rather added
Dialogue:IMOGEN=A lustre to it.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=                  O thou vile one!
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Sir,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:
Dialogue:IMOGEN=You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
Dialogue:IMOGEN=A man worth any woman, overbuys me
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Almost the sum he pays.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=What, art thou mad?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were
Dialogue:IMOGEN=A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Our neighbour shepherd's son!
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Thou foolish thing!
Notice:Re-enter QUEEN
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=They were again together: you have done

Dialogue:QUEEN=Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,
Dialogue:QUEEN=Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort
Dialogue:QUEEN=Out of your best advice.

Dialogue:QUEEN=Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?
Dialogue:PISANIO=My lord your son drew on my master.
Dialogue:QUEEN=Ha!
Dialogue:QUEEN=No harm, I trust, is done?
Dialogue:PISANIO=There might have been,
Dialogue:PISANIO=But that my master rather play'd than fought
Dialogue:PISANIO=And had no help of anger: they were parted
Dialogue:PISANIO=By gentlemen at hand.
Dialogue:QUEEN=I am very glad on't.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I would they were in Afric both together;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
Dialogue:IMOGEN=The goer-back. Why came you from your master?
Dialogue:PISANIO=On his command: he would not suffer me
Dialogue:PISANIO=To bring him to the haven; left these notes
Dialogue:PISANIO=Of what commands I should be subject to,
Dialogue:PISANIO=When 't pleased you to employ me.
Dialogue:QUEEN=This hath been
Dialogue:QUEEN=Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour
Dialogue:QUEEN=He will remain so.
Dialogue:PISANIO=                  I humbly thank your highness.
Dialogue:QUEEN=Pray, walk awhile.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=                  About some half-hour hence,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.
Notice:Exeunt
Banner:SCENE II. The same. A public place.
Notice:Enter CLOTEN and two Lords
Dialogue:First Lord=Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the
Dialogue:First Lord=violence of action hath made you reek as a
Dialogue:First Lord=sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:
Dialogue:First Lord=there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
Dialogue:CLOTEN=If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?
Dialogue:Second Lord=[Aside]  No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.
Dialogue:First Lord=Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be
Dialogue:First Lord=not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.
Dialogue:Second Lord=[Aside]  His steel was in debt; it went o' the
Dialogue:Second Lord=backside the town.
Dialogue:CLOTEN=The villain would not stand me.
Dialogue:Second Lord=[Aside]  No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.
Dialogue:First Lord=Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but
Dialogue:First Lord=he added to your having; gave you some ground.
Dialogue:Second Lord=[Aside]  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!
Dialogue:CLOTEN=I would they had not come between us.
Dialogue:Second Lord=[Aside]  So would I, till you had measured how long
Dialogue:Second Lord=a fool you were upon the ground.
Dialogue:CLOTEN=And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!
Dialogue:Second Lord=[Aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election, she
Dialogue:Second Lord=is damned.
Dialogue:First Lord=Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain
Dialogue:First Lord=go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen
Dialogue:First Lord=small reflection of her wit.
Dialogue:Second Lord=[Aside]  She shines not upon fools, lest the
Dialogue:Second Lord=reflection should hurt her.
Dialogue:CLOTEN=Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some
Dialogue:CLOTEN=hurt done!
Dialogue:Second Lord=[Aside]  I wish not so; unless it had been the fall
Dialogue:Second Lord=of an ass, which is no great hurt.
Dialogue:CLOTEN=You'll go with us?
Dialogue:First Lord=I'll attend your lordship.
Dialogue:CLOTEN=Nay, come, let's go together.
Dialogue:Second Lord=Well, my lord.
Notice:Exeunt
Banner:SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.
Notice:Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And question'dst every sail: if he should write
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
Dialogue:IMOGEN=That he spake to thee?
Dialogue:PISANIO=It was his queen, his queen!
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Then waved his handkerchief?
Dialogue:PISANIO=And kiss'd it, madam.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And that was all?
Dialogue:PISANIO=                  No, madam; for so long
Dialogue:PISANIO=As he could make me with this eye or ear
Dialogue:PISANIO=Distinguish him from others, he did keep
Dialogue:PISANIO=The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,
Dialogue:PISANIO=Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind
Dialogue:PISANIO=Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
Dialogue:PISANIO=How swift his ship.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Thou shouldst have made him
Dialogue:IMOGEN=As little as a crow, or less, ere left
Dialogue:IMOGEN=To after-eye him.
Dialogue:PISANIO=                  Madam, so I did.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but
Dialogue:IMOGEN=To look upon him, till the diminution
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from
Dialogue:IMOGEN=The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=When shall we hear from him?
Dialogue:PISANIO=Be assured, madam,
Dialogue:PISANIO=With his next vantage.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I did not take my leave of him, but had
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him
Dialogue:IMOGEN=How I would think on him at certain hours
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear
Dialogue:IMOGEN=The shes of Italy should not betray
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=To encounter me with orisons, for then
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Give him that parting kiss which I had set
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Shakes all our buds from growing.
Notice:Enter a Lady
Dialogue:Lady=The queen, madam,
Dialogue:Lady=Desires your highness' company.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.

Notice:Exeunt
Banner:SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.
Notice:Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was
Dialogue:IACHIMO=then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy
Dialogue:IACHIMO=as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I
Dialogue:IACHIMO=could then have looked on him without the help of
Dialogue:IACHIMO=admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments
Dialogue:IACHIMO=had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.
Dialogue:PHILARIO=You speak of him when he was less furnished than now
Dialogue:PHILARIO=he is with that which makes him both without and within.
Dialogue:Frenchman=I have seen him in France: we had very many there
Dialogue:Frenchman=could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein
Dialogue:IACHIMO=he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.
Dialogue:Frenchman=And then his banishment.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this
Dialogue:IACHIMO=lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
Dialogue:IACHIMO=to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=which else an easy battery might lay flat, for
Dialogue:IACHIMO=taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes
Dialogue:IACHIMO=it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
Dialogue:IACHIMO=acquaintance?
Dialogue:PHILARIO=His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I
Dialogue:PHILARIO=have been often bound for no less than my life.
Dialogue:PHILARIO=Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained
Dialogue:PHILARIO=amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your
Dialogue:PHILARIO=knowing, to a stranger of his quality.
Notice:Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
Dialogue:PHILARIO=I beseech you all, be better known to this
Dialogue:PHILARIO=gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend
Dialogue:PHILARIO=of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear
Dialogue:PHILARIO=hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.
Dialogue:Frenchman=Sir, we have known together in Orleans.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.
Dialogue:Frenchman=Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I
Dialogue:Frenchman=did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity
Dialogue:Frenchman=you should have been put together with so mortal a
Dialogue:Frenchman=purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so
Dialogue:Frenchman=slight and trivial a nature.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=my every action to be guided by others' experiences:
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.
Dialogue:Frenchman='Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,
Dialogue:Frenchman=and by such two that would by all likelihood have
Dialogue:Frenchman=confounded one the other, or have fallen both.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?
Dialogue:Frenchman=Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,
Dialogue:Frenchman=which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.
Dialogue:Frenchman=It was much like an argument that fell out last
Dialogue:Frenchman=night, where each of us fell in praise of our
Dialogue:Frenchman=country mistresses; this gentleman at that time
Dialogue:Frenchman=vouching--and upon warrant of bloody
Dialogue:Frenchman=affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,
Dialogue:Frenchman=chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable
Dialogue:Frenchman=than any the rarest of our ladies in France.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's
Dialogue:IACHIMO=opinion by this worn out.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=She holds her virtue still and I my mind.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=abate her nothing, though I profess myself her
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=adorer, not her friend.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand
Dialogue:IACHIMO=comparison--had been something too fair and too good
Dialogue:IACHIMO=for any lady in Britain. If she went before others
Dialogue:IACHIMO=I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres
Dialogue:IACHIMO=many I have beheld. I could not but believe she
Dialogue:IACHIMO=excelled many: but I have not seen the most
Dialogue:IACHIMO=precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=What do you esteem it at?
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=More than the world enjoys.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's
Dialogue:IACHIMO=outprized by a trifle.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=and only the gift of the gods.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Which the gods have given you?
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Which, by their graces, I will keep.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your
Dialogue:IACHIMO=ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable
Dialogue:IACHIMO=estimations; the one is but frail and the other
Dialogue:IACHIMO=casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished
Dialogue:IACHIMO=courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=nothing doubt you have store of thieves;
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.
Dialogue:PHILARIO=Let us leave here, gentlemen.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=With five times so much conversation, I should get
Dialogue:IACHIMO=ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even
Dialogue:IACHIMO=to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=No, no.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
Dialogue:IACHIMO=your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it
Dialogue:IACHIMO=something: but I make my wager rather against your
Dialogue:IACHIMO=confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your
Dialogue:IACHIMO=offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any
Dialogue:IACHIMO=lady in the world.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=You are a great deal abused in too bold a
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=worthy of by your attempt.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=What's that?
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=deserve more; a punishment too.
Dialogue:PHILARIO=Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;
Dialogue:PHILARIO=let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be
Dialogue:PHILARIO=better acquainted.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the
Dialogue:IACHIMO=approbation of what I have spoke!
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=What lady would you choose to assail?
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=that, commend me to the court where your lady is,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
Dialogue:IACHIMO=second conference, and I will bring from thence
Dialogue:IACHIMO=that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy
Dialogue:IACHIMO=ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot
Dialogue:IACHIMO=preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some
Dialogue:IACHIMO=religion in you, that you fear.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=graver purpose, I hope.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo
Dialogue:IACHIMO=what's spoken, I swear.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.
Dialogue:PHILARIO=I will have it no lay.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no
Dialogue:IACHIMO=sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest
Dialogue:IACHIMO=bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats
Dialogue:IACHIMO=are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are
Dialogue:IACHIMO=yours: provided I have your commendation for my more
Dialogue:IACHIMO=free entertainment.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=I embrace these conditions; let us have articles

Dialogue:QUEEN=Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:
Notice:Presenting a small box
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=But I beseech your grace, without offence,--
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Which are the movers of a languishing death;
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=But though slow, deadly?
Dialogue:QUEEN=I wonder, doctor,
Dialogue:QUEEN=Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
Dialogue:QUEEN=Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
Dialogue:QUEEN=To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
Dialogue:QUEEN=That our great king himself doth woo me oft
Dialogue:QUEEN=For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--
Dialogue:QUEEN=Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet
Dialogue:QUEEN=That I did amplify my judgment in
Dialogue:QUEEN=Other conclusions? I will try the forces
Dialogue:QUEEN=Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
Dialogue:QUEEN=We count not worth the hanging, but none human,
Dialogue:QUEEN=To try the vigour of them and apply
Dialogue:QUEEN=Allayments to their act, and by them gather
Dialogue:QUEEN=Their several virtues and effects.

Dialogue:CORNELIUS=But you shall do no harm.
Dialogue:QUEEN=[To PISANIO]            Hark thee, a word.
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=[Aside]  I do not like her. She doth think she has
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=And will not trust one of her malice with
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Which first, perchance, she'll prove on
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=cats and dogs,
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Then afterward up higher: but there is
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=No danger in what show of death it makes,
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=More than the locking-up the spirits a time,
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=With a most false effect; and I the truer,

Dialogue:QUEEN=I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then

Dialogue:QUEEN=Continue where he is: to shift his being
Dialogue:QUEEN=Is to exchange one misery with another,
Dialogue:QUEEN=And every day that comes comes to decay
Dialogue:QUEEN=A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,

Dialogue:QUEEN=Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,
Dialogue:QUEEN=So much as but to prop him?
Notice:The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up

Dialogue:QUEEN=What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;

Dialogue:IACHIMO=Some men are much to blame.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Not he, I hope.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might

Dialogue:IMOGEN=To my demands. Why do you pity me?
Dialogue:IACHIMO=That others do--

Dialogue:IMOGEN=What both you spur and stop.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Had I this cheek
Dialogue:IACHIMO=To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
Dialogue:IACHIMO=To the oath of loyalty; this object, which
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
Dialogue:IACHIMO=That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as
Dialogue:IACHIMO=With labour; then by-peeping in an eye
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Base and unlustrous as the smoky light
Dialogue:IACHIMO=That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit
Dialogue:IACHIMO=That all the plagues of hell should at one time

Dialogue:IACHIMO=As well might poison poison! Be revenged;
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Recoil from your great stock.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Revenged!
Dialogue:IMOGEN=How should I be revenged? If this be true,--
Dialogue:IMOGEN=As I have such a heart that both mine ears
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=How should I be revenged?
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Should he make me

Dialogue:IMOGEN=What, ho, Pisanio!
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Let me my service tender on your lips.

Dialogue:IMOGEN=Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far
Dialogue:IMOGEN=From thy report as thou from honour, and
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Solicit'st here a lady that disdains
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!
Dialogue:IMOGEN=The king my father shall be made acquainted
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,

Dialogue:IMOGEN=As in a Romish stew and to expound
Dialogue:IMOGEN=His beastly mind to us, he hath a court

Dialogue:IACHIMO=O happy Leonatus! I may say
Dialogue:IACHIMO=The credit that thy lady hath of thee
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!
Dialogue:IACHIMO=A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only
Dialogue:IACHIMO=For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=I have spoke this, to know if your affiance
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=That which he is, new o'er: and he is one
Dialogue:IACHIMO=The truest manner'd; such a holy witch
Dialogue:IACHIMO=That he enchants societies into him;
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Half all men's hearts are his.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=You make amends.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
Dialogue:IACHIMO=He hath a kind of honour sets him off,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Most mighty princess, that I have adventured
Dialogue:IACHIMO=To try your taking a false report; which hath

Dialogue:IACHIMO=In the election of a sir so rare,

Dialogue:IACHIMO=Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=All's well, sir: take my power i' the court
Dialogue:IMOGEN=for yours.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
Dialogue:IACHIMO=To entreat your grace but in a small request,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=And yet of moment to, for it concerns
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Your lord; myself and other noble friends,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Are partners in the business.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Pray, what is't?
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--
Dialogue:IACHIMO=The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums
Dialogue:IACHIMO=To buy a present for the emperor
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
Dialogue:IACHIMO=In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;
Dialogue:IACHIMO=And I am something curious, being strange,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=To have them in safe stowage: may it please you
Dialogue:IACHIMO=To take them in protection?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Willingly;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And pawn mine honour for their safety: since
Dialogue:IMOGEN=My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
Dialogue:IMOGEN=In my bedchamber.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=They are in a trunk,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Attended by my men: I will make bold
Dialogue:IACHIMO=To send them to you, only for this night;
Dialogue:IACHIMO=I must aboard to-morrow.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=O, no, no.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
Dialogue:IACHIMO=By lengthening my return. From Gallia

Dialogue:CLOTEN=must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine
Dialogue:CLOTEN=oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.
Dialogue:First Lord=What got he by that? You have broke his pate with

Dialogue:Second Lord=[Aside]  If his wit had been like him that broke it,

Dialogue:First Lord=Leonatus' friends.
Dialogue:CLOTEN=Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,

Dialogue:IACHIMO=I'll be sworn--
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=No swearing.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny

Dialogue:QUEEN=But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest
Dialogue:QUEEN=Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
Dialogue:QUEEN=Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--
Dialogue:QUEEN=That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried
Dialogue:QUEEN=From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--
Dialogue:QUEEN=Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,
Dialogue:QUEEN=Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd
Dialogue:QUEEN=As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof
Dialogue:QUEEN=The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--
Dialogue:QUEEN=O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,
Dialogue:QUEEN=Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright
Dialogue:QUEEN=And Britons strut with courage.
Dialogue:CLOTEN=Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our
Dialogue:CLOTEN=kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,
Dialogue:CLOTEN=as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of
Dialogue:CLOTEN=them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such
Dialogue:CLOTEN=straight arms, none.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Son, let your mother end.
Dialogue:CLOTEN=We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as
Dialogue:CLOTEN=Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a
Dialogue:CLOTEN=hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If
Dialogue:CLOTEN=Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or
Dialogue:CLOTEN=put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute
Dialogue:CLOTEN=for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=You must know,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Till the injurious Romans did extort
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=This tribute from us, we were free:
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Caesar's ambition,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=The sides o' the world, against all colour here
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Ourselves to be.
Dialogue:Lords=We do.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Say, then, to Caesar,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Who was the first of Britain which did put
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=His brows within a golden crown and call'd
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Himself a king.
Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=                  I am sorry, Cymbeline,
Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--
Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than
Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy:
Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=Receive it from me, then: war and confusion
Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look
Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,
Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=I thank thee for myself.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Thou art welcome, Caius.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Which he to seek of me again, perforce,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Which not to read would show the Britons cold:
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=So Caesar shall not find them.
Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=Let proof speak.
Dialogue:CLOTEN=His majesty bids you welcome. Make
Dialogue:CLOTEN=pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if
Dialogue:CLOTEN=you seek us afterwards in other terms, you
Dialogue:CLOTEN=shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you
Dialogue:CLOTEN=beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in
Dialogue:CLOTEN=the adventure, our crows shall fare the better
Dialogue:CLOTEN=for you; and there's an end.
Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=So, sir.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=I know your master's pleasure and he mine:
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=All the remain is 'Welcome!'

Dialogue:PISANIO=How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not
Dialogue:PISANIO=What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,
Dialogue:PISANIO=O master! what a strange infection
Dialogue:PISANIO=Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,
Dialogue:PISANIO=As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd
Dialogue:PISANIO=On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:
Dialogue:PISANIO=She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,
Dialogue:PISANIO=More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
Dialogue:PISANIO=As would take in some virtue. O my master!
Dialogue:PISANIO=Thy mind to her is now as low as were
Dialogue:PISANIO=Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?
Dialogue:PISANIO=Upon the love and truth and vows which I
Dialogue:PISANIO=Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?
Dialogue:PISANIO=If it be so to do good service, never
Dialogue:PISANIO=Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,
Dialogue:PISANIO=That I should seem to lack humanity
Dialogue:PISANIO=so much as this fact comes to?
Notice:Reading
Dialogue:PISANIO='Do't: the letter
Dialogue:PISANIO=that I have sent her, by her own command
Dialogue:PISANIO=Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!
Dialogue:PISANIO=Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,

Notice:Enter IMOGEN
Dialogue:IMOGEN=How now, Pisanio!
Dialogue:PISANIO=Madam, here is a letter from my lord.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!
Dialogue:IMOGEN=O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer
Dialogue:IMOGEN=That knew the stars as I his characters;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Let what is here contain'd relish of love,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not
Dialogue:IMOGEN=That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=For it doth physic love: of his content,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
Dialogue:IMOGEN=You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:

Dialogue:IMOGEN=You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!
Notice:Reads
Dialogue:IMOGEN='Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me
Dialogue:IMOGEN=in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as

Dialogue:IMOGEN=Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,--
Dialogue:IMOGEN=let me bate,-but not like me--yet long'st,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=To the smothering of the sense--how far it is
Dialogue:IMOGEN=To this same blessed Milford: and by the way
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
Dialogue:IMOGEN=To inherit such a haven: but first of all,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
Dialogue:IMOGEN=That we shall make in time, from our hence-going
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=How many score of miles may we well ride
Dialogue:IMOGEN='Twixt hour and hour?
Dialogue:PISANIO=One score 'twixt sun and sun,
Dialogue:PISANIO=Madam, 's enough for you:
Notice:Aside
Dialogue:PISANIO=and too much too.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Why, one that rode to's execution, man,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Could never go so slow: I have heard of
Dialogue:IMOGEN=riding wagers,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
Dialogue:IMOGEN=That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
Dialogue:IMOGEN=She'll home to her father: and provide me presently
Dialogue:IMOGEN=A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit
Dialogue:IMOGEN=A franklin's housewife.
Dialogue:PISANIO=Madam, you're best consider.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,

Notice:Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS; GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS following
Dialogue:BELARIUS=A goodly day not to keep house, with such
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
Dialogue:BELARIUS=To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
Dialogue:BELARIUS=And keep their impious turbans on, without
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
Dialogue:BELARIUS=We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly
Dialogue:BELARIUS=As prouder livers do.
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=Hail, heaven!
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=Hail, heaven!
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=When you above perceive me like a crow,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=That it is place which lessens and sets off;
Dialogue:BELARIUS=And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:
Dialogue:BELARIUS=This service is not service, so being done,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Draws us a profit from all things we see;
Dialogue:BELARIUS=And often, to our comfort, shall we find
Dialogue:BELARIUS=The sharded beetle in a safer hold
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Is nobler than attending for a cheque,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=What air's from home. Haply this life is best,
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=If quiet life be best; sweeter to you
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=That have a sharper known; well corresponding
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=With your stiff age: but unto us it is
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=A prison for a debtor, that not dares
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=To stride a limit.
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=                  What should we speak of
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=When we are old as you? when we shall hear
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=The rain and wind beat dark December, how,
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=And sing our bondage freely.
Dialogue:BELARIUS=How you speak!
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Did you but know the city's usuries
Dialogue:BELARIUS=And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court
Dialogue:BELARIUS=As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Is certain falling, or so slippery that
Dialogue:BELARIUS=The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=A pain that only seems to seek out danger
Dialogue:BELARIUS=I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'
Dialogue:BELARIUS=the search,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph
Dialogue:BELARIUS=As record of fair act; nay, many times,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story
Dialogue:BELARIUS=The world may read in me: my body's mark'd
Dialogue:BELARIUS=With Roman swords, and my report was once
Dialogue:BELARIUS=First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=And when a soldier was the theme, my name
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Was not far off: then was I as a tree
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=A storm or robbery, call it what you will,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=And left me bare to weather.
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=Uncertain favour!
Dialogue:BELARIUS=My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--
Dialogue:BELARIUS=But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
Dialogue:BELARIUS=I was confederate with the Romans: so
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years
Dialogue:BELARIUS=This rock and these demesnes have been my world;
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid
Dialogue:BELARIUS=More pious debts to heaven than in all
Dialogue:BELARIUS=The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!
Dialogue:BELARIUS=This is not hunters' language: he that strikes
Dialogue:BELARIUS=The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;
Dialogue:BELARIUS=To him the other two shall minister;
Dialogue:BELARIUS=And we will fear no poison, which attends
Dialogue:BELARIUS=In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.
Notice:Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
Dialogue:BELARIUS=How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
Dialogue:BELARIUS=These boys know little they are sons to the king;
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
Dialogue:BELARIUS=They think they are mine; and though train'd
Dialogue:BELARIUS=up thus meanly
Dialogue:BELARIUS=I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
Dialogue:BELARIUS=The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
Dialogue:BELARIUS=In simple and low things to prince it much
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
Dialogue:BELARIUS=The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!
Dialogue:BELARIUS=When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
Dialogue:BELARIUS=The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then
Dialogue:BELARIUS=The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
Dialogue:BELARIUS=That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
Dialogue:BELARIUS=His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!
Dialogue:BELARIUS=O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=At three and two years old, I stole these babes;
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for
Dialogue:BELARIUS=their mother,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=And every day do honour to her grave:

Dialogue:IMOGEN=Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so
Dialogue:IMOGEN=To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
Dialogue:IMOGEN=From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Beyond self-explication: put thyself
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with
Dialogue:IMOGEN=A look untender? If't be summer news,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st
Dialogue:IMOGEN=But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!
Dialogue:IMOGEN=That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue
Dialogue:IMOGEN=May take off some extremity, which to read
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Would be even mortal to me.
Dialogue:PISANIO=Please you, read;
Dialogue:PISANIO=And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
Dialogue:PISANIO=The most disdain'd of fortune.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=[Reads]  'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the
Dialogue:IMOGEN=strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie
Dialogue:IMOGEN=bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain
Dialogue:IMOGEN=as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with
Dialogue:IMOGEN=the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away
Dialogue:IMOGEN=her life: I shall give thee opportunity at
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose
Dialogue:IMOGEN=where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain
Dialogue:IMOGEN=it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and
Dialogue:IMOGEN=equally to me disloyal.'
Dialogue:PISANIO=What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper
Dialogue:PISANIO=Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,
Dialogue:PISANIO=Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
Dialogue:PISANIO=Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
Dialogue:PISANIO=Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
Dialogue:PISANIO=All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,
Dialogue:PISANIO=Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
Dialogue:PISANIO=This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=False to his bed! What is it to be false?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=To lie in watch there and to think on him?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep
Dialogue:IMOGEN=charge nature,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=To break it with a fearful dream of him
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?
Dialogue:PISANIO=Alas, good lady!
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Put on for villany; not born where't grows,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=But worn a bait for ladies.
Dialogue:PISANIO=Good madam, hear me.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
Dialogue:IMOGEN=From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
Dialogue:IMOGEN=From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=A little witness my obedience: look!
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit
Dialogue:IMOGEN=The innocent mansion of my love, my heart;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Thy master is not there, who was indeed
Dialogue:IMOGEN=The riches of it: do his bidding; strike
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=But now thou seem'st a coward.
Dialogue:PISANIO=Hence, vile instrument!
Dialogue:PISANIO=Thou shalt not damn my hand.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Why, I must die;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
Dialogue:IMOGEN=No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter
Dialogue:IMOGEN=There is a prohibition so divine
Dialogue:IMOGEN=That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Believe false teachers: though those that
Dialogue:IMOGEN=are betray'd
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Stands in worse case of woe.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up
Dialogue:IMOGEN=My disobedience 'gainst the king my father
Dialogue:IMOGEN=And make me put into contempt the suits
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
Dialogue:IMOGEN=It is no act of common passage, but
Dialogue:IMOGEN=A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself

Dialogue:IMOGEN=That now thou tirest on, how thy memory
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:
Dialogue:IMOGEN=The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,

Dialogue:PISANIO=O gracious lady,
Dialogue:PISANIO=Since I received command to do this business
Dialogue:PISANIO=I have not slept one wink.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Do't, and to bed then.
Dialogue:PISANIO=I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Wherefore then
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
Dialogue:IMOGEN=So many miles with a pretence? this place?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=For my being absent? whereunto I never
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=The elected deer before thee?
Dialogue:PISANIO=But to win time
Dialogue:PISANIO=To lose so bad employment; in the which
Dialogue:PISANIO=I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,
Dialogue:PISANIO=Hear me with patience.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Talk thy tongue weary; speak
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.
Dialogue:PISANIO=Then, madam,
Dialogue:PISANIO=I thought you would not back again.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Most like;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Bringing me here to kill me.
Dialogue:PISANIO=Not so, neither:
Dialogue:PISANIO=But if I were as wise as honest, then
Dialogue:PISANIO=My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
Dialogue:PISANIO=But that my master is abused:
Dialogue:PISANIO=Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.
Dialogue:PISANIO=Hath done you both this cursed injury.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Some Roman courtezan.
Dialogue:PISANIO=No, on my life.
Dialogue:PISANIO=I'll give but notice you are dead and send him
Dialogue:PISANIO=Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded
Dialogue:PISANIO=I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,
Dialogue:PISANIO=And that will well confirm it.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Why good fellow,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Or in my life what comfort, when I am
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Dead to my husband?
Dialogue:PISANIO=If you'll back to the court--
Dialogue:IMOGEN=No court, no father; nor no more ado
Dialogue:IMOGEN=With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me
Dialogue:IMOGEN=As fearful as a siege.
Dialogue:PISANIO=If not at court,
Dialogue:PISANIO=Then not in Britain must you bide.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Where then
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think
Dialogue:IMOGEN=There's livers out of Britain.
Dialogue:PISANIO=I am most glad
Dialogue:PISANIO=You think of other place. The ambassador,
Dialogue:PISANIO=Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven
Dialogue:PISANIO=To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind
Dialogue:PISANIO=Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
Dialogue:PISANIO=That which, to appear itself, must not yet be
Dialogue:PISANIO=But by self-danger, you should tread a course
Dialogue:PISANIO=Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near
Dialogue:PISANIO=The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least
Dialogue:PISANIO=That though his actions were not visible, yet
Dialogue:PISANIO=Report should render him hourly to your ear
Dialogue:PISANIO=As truly as he moves.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=O, for such means!
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I would adventure.
Dialogue:PISANIO=Well, then, here's the point:
Dialogue:PISANIO=You must forget to be a woman; change

Dialogue:CLOTEN=Hum!
Dialogue:PISANIO=[Aside]  I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,
Dialogue:PISANIO=Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!
Dialogue:CLOTEN=Sirrah, is this letter true?
Dialogue:PISANIO=Sir, as I think.
Dialogue:CLOTEN=It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou

Dialogue:CLOTEN=undergo those employments wherein I should have
Dialogue:CLOTEN=cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,
Dialogue:CLOTEN=what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it
Dialogue:CLOTEN=directly and truly, I would think thee an honest
Dialogue:CLOTEN=man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
Dialogue:CLOTEN=relief nor my voice for thy preferment.
Dialogue:PISANIO=Well, my good lord.
Dialogue:CLOTEN=Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and
Dialogue:CLOTEN=constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of
Dialogue:CLOTEN=that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the
Dialogue:CLOTEN=course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of
Dialogue:CLOTEN=mine: wilt thou serve me?
Dialogue:PISANIO=Sir, I will.

Dialogue:CLOTEN=Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one
Dialogue:CLOTEN=thing; I'll remember't anon:--even there, thou
Dialogue:CLOTEN=villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these
Dialogue:CLOTEN=garments were come. She said upon a time--the
Dialogue:CLOTEN=bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she
Dialogue:CLOTEN=held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect
Dialogue:CLOTEN=than my noble and natural person together with the
Dialogue:CLOTEN=adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my
Dialogue:CLOTEN=back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her
Dialogue:CLOTEN=eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then
Dialogue:CLOTEN=be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my

Dialogue:CLOTEN=her I will execute in the clothes that she so

Dialogue:CLOTEN=Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second
Dialogue:CLOTEN=thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,
Dialogue:CLOTEN=that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be

Dialogue:First Gaoler=Come, sir, are you ready for death?
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.
Dialogue:First Gaoler=Hanging is the word, sir: if
Dialogue:First Gaoler=you be ready for that, you are well cooked.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=So, if I prove a good repast to the
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=spectators, the dish pays the shot.
Dialogue:First Gaoler=A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,
Dialogue:First Gaoler=you shall be called to no more payments, fear no
Dialogue:First Gaoler=more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of
Dialogue:First Gaoler=parting, as the procuring of mirth: you come in
Dialogue:First Gaoler=flint for want of meat, depart reeling with too
Dialogue:First Gaoler=much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and
Dialogue:First Gaoler=sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain
Dialogue:First Gaoler=both empty; the brain the heavier for being too
Dialogue:First Gaoler=light, the purse too light, being drawn of
Dialogue:First Gaoler=heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be
Dialogue:First Gaoler=quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up
Dialogue:First Gaoler=thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and
Dialogue:First Gaoler=creditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come,
Dialogue:First Gaoler=the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book and
Dialogue:First Gaoler=counters; so the acquittance follows.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=I am merrier to die than thou art to live.
Dialogue:First Gaoler=Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the
Dialogue:First Gaoler=tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your
Dialogue:First Gaoler=sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he
Dialogue:First Gaoler=would change places with his officer; for, look you,
Dialogue:First Gaoler=sir, you know not which way you shall go.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Yes, indeed do I, fellow.
Dialogue:First Gaoler=Your death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seen
Dialogue:First Gaoler=him so pictured: you must either be directed by
Dialogue:First Gaoler=some that take upon them to know, or do take upon
Dialogue:First Gaoler=yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or
Dialogue:First Gaoler=jump the after inquiry on your own peril: and how
Dialogue:First Gaoler=you shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll
Dialogue:First Gaoler=never return to tell one.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=will not use them.
Dialogue:First Gaoler=What an infinite mock is this, that a man should
Dialogue:First Gaoler=have the best use of eyes to see the way of
Dialogue:First Gaoler=blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.

Dialogue:First Gaoler=for all he be a Roman: and there be some of them
Dialogue:First Gaoler=too that die against their wills; so should I, if I
Dialogue:First Gaoler=were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one
Dialogue:First Gaoler=mind good; O, there were desolation of gaolers and
Dialogue:First Gaoler=gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but

Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Were present when she finish'd.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Prithee, say.
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=First, she confess'd she never loved you, only
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Affected greatness got by you, not you:
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Married your royalty, was wife to your place;
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Abhorr'd your person.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=She alone knew this;
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=And, but she spoke it dying, I would not
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=With such integrity, she did confess

Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Ta'en off by poison.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=O most delicate fiend!
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Should by the minute feed on life and lingering
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to

Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Mine eyes
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;

Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,
Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=And spare no blood beside.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=I have surely seen him:
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=His favour is familiar to me. Boy,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,

Dialogue:IACHIMO=Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=How! me?
Dialogue:IACHIMO=I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Which torments me to conceal. By villany
Dialogue:IACHIMO=I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Whom thou didst banish; and--which more may
Dialogue:IACHIMO=grieve thee,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived
Dialogue:IACHIMO='Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=All that belongs to this.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=That paragon, thy daughter,--
Dialogue:IACHIMO=For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.

Dialogue:IACHIMO=The mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, would
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Our viands had been poison'd, or at least
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Those which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--
Dialogue:IACHIMO=What should I say? he was too good to be
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Where ill men were; and was the best of all
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
Dialogue:IACHIMO=For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming
Dialogue:IACHIMO=The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.

Dialogue:IACHIMO=Fairness which strikes the eye--
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=I stand on fire:
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Come to the matter.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=All too soon I shall,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Most like a noble lord in love and one
Dialogue:IACHIMO=That had a royal lover, took his hint;
Dialogue:IACHIMO=And, not dispraising whom we praised,--therein
Dialogue:IACHIMO=He was as calm as virtue--he began
Dialogue:IACHIMO=His mistress' picture; which by his tongue
Dialogue:IACHIMO=being made,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=And then a mind put in't, either our brags
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Proved us unspeaking sots.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Nay, nay, to the purpose.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Upon his honour'd finger, to attain
Dialogue:IACHIMO=In suit the place of's bed and win this ring
Dialogue:IACHIMO=By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=No lesser of her honour confident
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;
Dialogue:IACHIMO=And would so, had it been a carbuncle
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Post I in this design: well may you, sir,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Remember me at court; where I was taught
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
Dialogue:IACHIMO='Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd

Dialogue:IACHIMO='Gan in your duller Britain operate
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:
Dialogue:IACHIMO=And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,

Dialogue:IACHIMO=To make the noble Leonatus mad,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=By wounding his belief in her renown
Dialogue:IACHIMO=With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--
Dialogue:IACHIMO=O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Of secret on her person, that he could not
Dialogue:IACHIMO=But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,

Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=For torturers ingenious: it is I
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=That caused a lesser villain than myself,

Dialogue:CYMBELINE=The tune of Imogen!
Dialogue:PISANIO=Lady,
Dialogue:PISANIO=The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if
Dialogue:PISANIO=That box I gave you was not thought by me
Dialogue:PISANIO=A precious thing: I had it from the queen.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=New matter still?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=                  It poison'd me.
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=O gods!
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Which I gave him for cordial, she is served
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=As I would serve a rat.'
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=What's this, Comelius?
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=The queen, sir, very oft importuned me
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=To temper poisons for her, still pretending
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=The satisfaction of her knowledge only
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Was of more danger, did compound for her
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=The present power of life, but in short time
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=All offices of nature should again
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Most like I did, for I was dead.
Dialogue:BELARIUS=My boys,

Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Wilt thou not speak to me?
Dialogue:IMOGEN=[Kneeling]               Your blessing, sir.

Dialogue:IMOGEN=I am sorry for't, my lord.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=O, she was nought; and long of her it was
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=That we meet here so strangely: but her son
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Is gone, we know not how nor where.
Dialogue:PISANIO=My lord,
Dialogue:PISANIO=Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,
Dialogue:PISANIO=Upon my lady's missing, came to me
Dialogue:PISANIO=With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,
Dialogue:PISANIO=If I discover'd not which way she was gone,
Dialogue:PISANIO=It was my instant death. By accident,
Dialogue:PISANIO=had a feigned letter of my master's
Dialogue:PISANIO=Then in my pocket; which directed him

Dialogue:PISANIO=Which he enforced from me, away he posts
Dialogue:PISANIO=With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
Dialogue:PISANIO=My lady's honour: what became of him
Dialogue:PISANIO=I further know not.
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=Let me end the story:
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=I slew him there.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Marry, the gods forfend!
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Deny't again.
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=                  I have spoke it, and I did it.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=He was a prince.
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=With language that would make me spurn the sea,
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=And am right glad he is not standing here
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=To tell this tale of mine.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=I am sorry for thee:
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Endure our law: thou'rt dead.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=That headless man
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I thought had been my lord.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Bind the offender,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=And take him from our presence.
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Stay, sir king:
Dialogue:BELARIUS=This man is better than the man he slew,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=As well descended as thyself; and hath
Dialogue:BELARIUS=More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Had ever scar for.

Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Why, old soldier,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=As good as we?
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=                  In that he spake too far.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=And thou shalt die for't.
Dialogue:BELARIUS=We will die all three:
Dialogue:BELARIUS=But I will prove that two on's are as good
Dialogue:BELARIUS=As I have given out him. My sons, I must,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Though, haply, well for you.
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=Your danger's ours.
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=And our good his.
Dialogue:BELARIUS=                  Have at it then, by leave.
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Thou hadst, great king, a subject who
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Was call'd Belarius.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=What of him? he is
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=A banish'd traitor.
Dialogue:BELARIUS=He it is that hath
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Assumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;
Dialogue:BELARIUS=I know not how a traitor.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Take him hence:
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=The whole world shall not save him.
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Not too hot:
Dialogue:BELARIUS=First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;
Dialogue:BELARIUS=And let it be confiscate all, so soon
Dialogue:BELARIUS=As I have received it.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Nursing of my sons!
Dialogue:BELARIUS=I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=These two young gentlemen, that call me father
Dialogue:BELARIUS=And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
Dialogue:BELARIUS=They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=And blood of your begetting.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=How! my issue!
Dialogue:BELARIUS=So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--
Dialogue:BELARIUS=For such and so they are--these twenty years
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Having received the punishment before,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Here are your sons again; and I must lose
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
Dialogue:BELARIUS=The benediction of these covering heavens
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
Dialogue:BELARIUS=To inlay heaven with stars.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Thou weep'st, and speak'st.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=The service that you three have done is more
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=If these be they, I know not how to wish
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=A pair of worthier sons.
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Be pleased awhile.
Dialogue:BELARIUS=This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:
Dialogue:BELARIUS=This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd
Dialogue:BELARIUS=In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Of his queen mother, which for more probation
Dialogue:BELARIUS=I can with ease produce.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Guiderius had
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=It was a mark of wonder.
Dialogue:BELARIUS=This is he;
Dialogue:BELARIUS=Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:
Dialogue:BELARIUS=It was wise nature's end in the donation,
Dialogue:BELARIUS=To be his evidence now.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=O, what, am I
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=That, after this strange starting from your orbs,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=may reign in them now! O Imogen,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=No, my lord;
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
Dialogue:IMOGEN=But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=When I was but your sister; I you brothers,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=When ye were so indeed.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Did you e'er meet?
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=Ay, my good lord.
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=                  And at first meeting loved;
Dialogue:GUIDERIUS=Continued so, until we thought he died.
Dialogue:CORNELIUS=By the queen's dram she swallow'd.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=O rare instinct!
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=When shall I hear all through? This fierce
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=abridgement
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=How parted with your brothers? how first met them?
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=And your three motives to the battle, with
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=I know not how much more, should be demanded;
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=And all the other by-dependencies,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Each object with a joy: the counterchange
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
Notice:To BELARIUS
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=You are my father too, and did relieve me,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=To see this gracious season.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=All o'erjoy'd,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=For they shall taste our comfort.
Dialogue:IMOGEN=My good master,
Dialogue:IMOGEN=I will yet do you service.
Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=Happy be you!
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=He would have well becomed this place, and graced
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=The thankings of a king.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=I am, sir,
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=The soldier that did company these three
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Have made you finish.
Dialogue:IACHIMO=[Kneeling]          I am down again:
Dialogue:IACHIMO=But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,
Dialogue:IACHIMO=Which I so often owe: but your ring first;
Dialogue:IACHIMO=And here the bracelet of the truest princess
Dialogue:IACHIMO=That ever swore her faith.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Kneel not to me:
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=The power that I have on you is, to spare you;
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=The malice towards you to forgive you: live,
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=And deal with others better.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Nobly doom'd!
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Pardon's the word to all.
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=You holp us, sir,
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=As you did mean indeed to be our brother;
Dialogue:ARVIRAGUS=Joy'd are we that you are.
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=This label on my bosom; whose containing
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Is so from sense in hardness, that I can
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=Make no collection of it: let him show
Dialogue:POSTHUMUS LEONATUS=His skill in the construction.
Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=Philarmonus!
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Here, my good lord.
Dialogue:CAIUS LUCIUS=Read, and declare the meaning.
Dialogue:Soothsayer=[Reads]  'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself
Dialogue:Soothsayer=unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a
Dialogue:Soothsayer=piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar
Dialogue:Soothsayer=shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many
Dialogue:Soothsayer=years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old
Dialogue:Soothsayer=stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end
Dialogue:Soothsayer=his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in
Dialogue:Soothsayer=peace and plenty.'
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;
Dialogue:Soothsayer=The fit and apt construction of thy name,
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Being Leonatus, doth import so much.
Notice:To CYMBELINE
Dialogue:Soothsayer=The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'
Dialogue:Soothsayer=We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Is this most constant wife; who, even now,
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Answering the letter of the oracle,
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
Dialogue:Soothsayer=With this most tender air.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=This hath some seeming.
Dialogue:Soothsayer=The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,
Dialogue:Soothsayer=For many years thought dead, are now revived,
Dialogue:Soothsayer=To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Promises Britain peace and plenty.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Well
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=And to the Roman empire; promising
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=To pay our wonted tribute, from the which
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Have laid most heavy hand.
Dialogue:Soothsayer=The fingers of the powers above do tune
Dialogue:Soothsayer=The harmony of this peace. The vision
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,
Dialogue:Soothsayer=From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun
Dialogue:Soothsayer=So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,
Dialogue:Soothsayer=The imperial Caesar, should again unite
Dialogue:Soothsayer=His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Which shines here in the west.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Laud we the gods;
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=From our blest altars. Publish we this peace
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=To all our subjects. Set we forward: let
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=A Roman and a British ensign wave
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=And in the temple of great Jupiter
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Set on there! Never was a war did cease,
Dialogue:CYMBELINE=Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
