Dialogue#Chorus=O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend
Dialogue#Chorus=The brightest heaven of invention,
Dialogue#Chorus=A kingdom for a stage, princes to act
Dialogue#Chorus=And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
Dialogue#Chorus=Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
Dialogue#Chorus=Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,
Dialogue#Chorus=Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire
Dialogue#Chorus=Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,
Dialogue#Chorus=The flat unraised spirits that have dared
Dialogue#Chorus=On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
Dialogue#Chorus=So great an object: can this cockpit hold
Dialogue#Chorus=The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
Dialogue#Chorus=Within this wooden O the very casques
Dialogue#Chorus=That did affright the air at Agincourt?
Dialogue#Chorus=O, pardon! since a crooked figure may
Dialogue#Chorus=Attest in little place a million;
Dialogue#Chorus=And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
Dialogue#Chorus=On your imaginary forces work.
Dialogue#Chorus=Suppose within the girdle of these walls
Dialogue#Chorus=Are now confined two mighty monarchies,
Dialogue#Chorus=Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
Dialogue#Chorus=The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:
Dialogue#Chorus=Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;
Dialogue#Chorus=Into a thousand parts divide on man,
Dialogue#Chorus=And make imaginary puissance;
Dialogue#Chorus=Think when we talk of horses, that you see them
Dialogue#Chorus=Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;
Dialogue#Chorus=For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,
Dialogue#Chorus=Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,
Dialogue#Chorus=Turning the accomplishment of many years

Dialogue#Chorus=Admit me Chorus to this history;

Dialogue#Chorus=Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.

Notice#Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=But that the scambling and unquiet time
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Did push it out of farther question.
Dialogue#ELY=But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=We lose the better half of our possession:
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=For all the temporal lands which men devout
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=By testament have given to the church
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Would they strip from us; being valued thus:
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And to the coffers of the king beside,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.
Dialogue#ELY=This would drink deep.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY='Twould drink the cup and all.
Dialogue#ELY=But what prevention?
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The king is full of grace and fair regard.
Dialogue#ELY=And a true lover of the holy church.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The courses of his youth promised it not.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The breath no sooner left his father's body,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=But that his wildness, mortified in him,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Consideration, like an angel, came
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Leaving his body as a paradise,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=To envelop and contain celestial spirits.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Never was such a sudden scholar made;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Never came reformation in a flood,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=With such a heady currance, scouring faults
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=So soon did lose his seat and all at once
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=As in this king.
Dialogue#ELY=                  We are blessed in the change.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Hear him but reason in divinity,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And all-admiring with an inward wish
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=You would desire the king were made a prelate:
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=You would say it hath been all in all his study:
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=A fearful battle render'd you in music:
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Turn him to any cause of policy,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=So that the art and practic part of life
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Must be the mistress to this theoric:
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Since his addiction was to courses vain,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And never noted in him any study,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Any retirement, any sequestration
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=From open haunts and popularity.
Dialogue#ELY=The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
Dialogue#ELY=And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
Dialogue#ELY=Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
Dialogue#ELY=And so the prince obscured his contemplation
Dialogue#ELY=Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
Dialogue#ELY=Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
Dialogue#ELY=Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=It must be so; for miracles are ceased;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And therefore we must needs admit the means
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=How things are perfected.
Dialogue#ELY=But, my good lord,
Dialogue#ELY=How now for mitigation of this bill
Dialogue#ELY=Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty
Dialogue#ELY=Incline to it, or no?
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=He seems indifferent,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Or rather swaying more upon our part
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=For I have made an offer to his majesty,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Upon our spiritual convocation
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And in regard of causes now in hand,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Which I have open'd to his grace at large,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=As touching France, to give a greater sum
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Than ever at one time the clergy yet
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Did to his predecessors part withal.
Dialogue#ELY=How did this offer seem received, my lord?
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=With good acceptance of his majesty;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Save that there was not time enough to hear,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=As I perceived his grace would fain have done,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The severals and unhidden passages
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And generally to the crown and seat of France
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.
Dialogue#ELY=What was the impediment that broke this off?
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The French ambassador upon that instant
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?
Dialogue#ELY=It is.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Then go we in, to know his embassy;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Which I could with a ready guess declare,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.
Dialogue#ELY=I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.

Notice#Enter KING HENRY V, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and Attendants
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
Dialogue#EXETER=Not here in presence.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Send for him, good uncle.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Before we hear him, of some things of weight
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.
Notice#Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=God and his angels guard your sacred throne
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And make you long become it!
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Sure, we thank you.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=My learned lord, we pray you to proceed
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And justly and religiously unfold
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Why the law Salique that they have in France
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Or nicely charge your understanding soul
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=With opening titles miscreate, whose right
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Suits not in native colours with the truth;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=For God doth know how many now in health
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Shall drop their blood in approbation
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=How you awake our sleeping sword of war:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=For never two such kingdoms did contend
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Are every one a woe, a sore complaint
Dialogue#KING HENRY V='Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That make such waste in brief mortality.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=For we will hear, note and believe in heart
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=As pure as sin with baptism.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=That owe yourselves, your lives and services
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=To this imperial throne. There is no bar
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=To make against your highness' claim to France
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY='In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'
Dialogue#CANTERBURY='No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The founder of this law and female bar.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=That the land Salique is in Germany,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=There left behind and settled certain French;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Who, holding in disdain the German women
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=For some dishonest manners of their life,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Then doth it well appear that Salique law
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Was not devised for the realm of France:
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Nor did the French possess the Salique land
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Until four hundred one and twenty years
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=After defunction of King Pharamond,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Idly supposed the founder of this law;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Who died within the year of our redemption
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Beyond the river Sala, in the year
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Did, as heir general, being descended
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Make claim and title to the crown of France.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=To find his title with some shows of truth,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY='Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Was re-united to the crown of France.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=To hold in right and title of the female:
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=So do the kings of France unto this day;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=To bar your highness claiming from the female,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And rather choose to hide them in a net
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=May I with right and conscience make this claim?
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=When the man dies, let the inheritance
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Look back into your mighty ancestors:
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Making defeat on the full power of France,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Forage in blood of French nobility.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=O noble English. that could entertain
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=With half their forces the full Pride of France
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And let another half stand laughing by,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=All out of work and cold for action!
Dialogue#ELY=Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
Dialogue#ELY=And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
Dialogue#ELY=You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
Dialogue#ELY=The blood and courage that renowned them
Dialogue#ELY=Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
Dialogue#ELY=Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
Dialogue#ELY=Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.
Dialogue#EXETER=Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
Dialogue#EXETER=Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
Dialogue#EXETER=As did the former lions of your blood.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=They know your grace hath cause and means and might;
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=So hath your highness; never king of England
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=With blood and sword and fire to win your right;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=As never did the clergy at one time
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Bring in to any of your ancestors.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=We must not only arm to invade the French,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=But lay down our proportions to defend
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=With all advantages.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Our inland from the pilfering borderers.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=For you shall read that my great-grandfather
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Never went with his forces into France
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=With ample and brim fulness of his force,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That England, being empty of defence,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=For hear her but exampled by herself:
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=When all her chivalry hath been in France
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=She hath herself not only well defended
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=But taken and impounded as a stray
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And make her chronicle as rich with praise
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=But there's a saying very old and true,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND='If that you will France win,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Then with Scotland first begin:'
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=For once the eagle England being in prey,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
Dialogue#WESTMORELAND=To tear and havoc more than she can eat.
Dialogue#EXETER=It follows then the cat must stay at home:
Dialogue#EXETER=Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,
Dialogue#EXETER=Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,
Dialogue#EXETER=And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
Dialogue#EXETER=While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
Dialogue#EXETER=The advised head defends itself at home;
Dialogue#EXETER=For government, though high and low and lower,
Dialogue#EXETER=Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
Dialogue#EXETER=Congreeing in a full and natural close,
Dialogue#EXETER=Like music.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=          Therefore doth heaven divide
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The state of man in divers functions,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Setting endeavour in continual motion;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=They have a king and officers of sorts;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Which pillage they with merry march bring home
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=To the tent-royal of their emperor;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The singing masons building roofs of gold,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The poor mechanic porters crowding in
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Delivering o'er to executors pale
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=That many things, having full reference
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=To one consent, may work contrariously:
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=As many arrows, loosed several ways,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=As many lines close in the dial's centre;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=So may a thousand actions, once afoot.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=End in one purpose, and be all well borne
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Divide your happy England into four;
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Whereof take you one quarter into France,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=Let us be worried and our nation lose
Dialogue#CANTERBURY=The name of hardiness and policy.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And yours, the noble sinews of our power,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Ruling in large and ample empery
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Tombless, with no remembrance over them:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Either our history shall with full mouth
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Your greeting is from him, not from the king.
Dialogue#First Ambassador=May't please your majesty to give us leave
Dialogue#First Ambassador=Freely to render what we have in charge;
Dialogue#First Ambassador=Or shall we sparingly show you far off
Dialogue#First Ambassador=The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Tell us the Dauphin's mind.
Dialogue#First Ambassador=Thus, then, in few.
Dialogue#First Ambassador=Your highness, lately sending into France,
Dialogue#First Ambassador=Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right
Dialogue#First Ambassador=Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.
Dialogue#First Ambassador=In answer of which claim, the prince our master
Dialogue#First Ambassador=Says that you savour too much of your youth,
Dialogue#First Ambassador=And bids you be advised there's nought in France
Dialogue#First Ambassador=That can be with a nimble galliard won;
Dialogue#First Ambassador=You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
Dialogue#First Ambassador=He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
Dialogue#First Ambassador=This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,
Dialogue#First Ambassador=Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
Dialogue#First Ambassador=Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=What treasure, uncle?
Dialogue#EXETER=Tennis-balls, my liege.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=His present and your pains we thank you for:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=With chaces. And we understand him well,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Not measuring what use we made of them.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=We never valued this poor seat of England;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That men are merriest when they are from home.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=For that I have laid by my majesty
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And plodded like a man for working-days,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=But I will rise there with so full a glory
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And some are yet ungotten and unborn
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=But this lies all within the will of God,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=To whom I do appeal; and in whose name
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=To venge me as I may and to put forth
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=His jest will savour but of shallow wit,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
Notice#Exeunt Ambassadors
Dialogue#EXETER=This was a merry message.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=We hope to make the sender blush at it.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That may give furtherance to our expedition;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=For we have now no thought in us but France,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Save those to God, that run before our business.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Therefore let our proportions for these wars
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Be soon collected and all things thought upon
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That may with reasonable swiftness add
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=More feathers to our wings; for, God before,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Therefore let every man now task his thought,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That this fair action may on foot be brought.

Dialogue#NYM=For my part, I care not: I say little; but when
Dialogue#NYM=time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that
Dialogue#NYM=shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will
Dialogue#NYM=wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but

Dialogue#NYM=endure cold as another man's sword will: and

Dialogue#BARDOLPH=Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=were troth-plight to her.
Dialogue#NYM=I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may
Dialogue#NYM=sleep, and they may have their throats about them at
Dialogue#NYM=that time; and some say knives have edges. It must
Dialogue#NYM=be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet
Dialogue#NYM=she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I
Dialogue#NYM=cannot tell.

Dialogue#PISTOL=And flashing fire will follow.
Dialogue#NYM=I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an
Dialogue#NYM=humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow
Dialogue#NYM=foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my
Dialogue#NYM=rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk
Dialogue#NYM=off, I would prick your guts a little, in good
Dialogue#NYM=terms, as I may: and that's the humour of it.

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Will cut their passage through the force of France,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Doing the execution and the act
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=For which we have in head assembled them?
Dialogue#SCROOP=No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=We carry not a heart with us from hence
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That grows not in a fair consent with ours,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Success and conquest to attend on us.
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=Under the sweet shade of your government.
Dialogue#GREY=True: those that were your father's enemies
Dialogue#GREY=Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you
Dialogue#GREY=With hearts create of duty and of zeal.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And shall forget the office of our hand,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=According to the weight and worthiness.
Dialogue#SCROOP=So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
Dialogue#SCROOP=And labour shall refresh itself with hope,
Dialogue#SCROOP=To do your grace incessant services.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Enlarge the man committed yesterday,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That rail'd against our person: we consider
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=it was excess of wine that set him on;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And on his more advice we pardon him.
Dialogue#SCROOP=That's mercy, but too much security:
Dialogue#SCROOP=Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example
Dialogue#SCROOP=Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=O, let us yet be merciful.
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=So may your highness, and yet punish too.
Dialogue#GREY=Sir,
Dialogue#GREY=You show great mercy, if you give him life,
Dialogue#GREY=After the taste of much correction.

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=If little faults, proceeding on distemper,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Would have him punished. And now to our French causes:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Who are the late commissioners?
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=I one, my lord:
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.
Dialogue#SCROOP=So did you me, my liege.
Dialogue#GREY=And I, my royal sovereign.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=We will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen!
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=What see you in those papers that you lose
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That hath so cowarded and chased your blood
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Out of appearance?
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=                  I do confess my fault;
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=And do submit me to your highness' mercy.
Dialogue#SCROOP=To which we all appeal.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=The mercy that was quick in us but late,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=See you, my princes, and my noble peers,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=You know how apt our love was to accord
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=To furnish him with all appertinents
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Belonging to his honour; and this man
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And sworn unto the practises of France,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=To kill us here in Hampton: to the which
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=May it be possible, that foreign hire
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Treason and murder ever kept together,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Working so grossly in a natural cause,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That admiration did not whoop at them:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That wrought upon thee so preposterously
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=All other devils that suggest by treasons
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Do botch and bungle up damnation
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=From glistering semblances of piety;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=He might return to vasty Tartar back,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And tell the legions 'I can never win
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infected
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Not working with the eye without the ear,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And but in purged judgment trusting neither?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=To mark the full-fraught man and best indued
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Another fall of man. Their faults are open:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Arrest them to the answer of the law;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And God acquit them of their practises!
Dialogue#EXETER=   I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
Dialogue#EXETER=Richard Earl of Cambridge.
Dialogue#EXETER=I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
Dialogue#EXETER=Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.
Dialogue#EXETER=I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
Dialogue#EXETER=Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.
Dialogue#SCROOP=Our purposes God justly hath discover'd;
Dialogue#SCROOP=And I repent my fault more than my death;
Dialogue#SCROOP=Which I beseech your highness to forgive,
Dialogue#SCROOP=Although my body pay the price of it.
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=For me, the gold of France did not seduce;
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=Although I did admit it as a motive
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=The sooner to effect what I intended:
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=But God be thanked for prevention;
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,
Dialogue#CAMBRIDGE=Beseeching God and you to pardon me.
Dialogue#GREY=Never did faithful subject more rejoice
Dialogue#GREY=At the discovery of most dangerous treason
Dialogue#GREY=Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself.
Dialogue#GREY=Prevented from a damned enterprise:
Dialogue#GREY=My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=You have conspired against our royal person,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Received the golden earnest of our death;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=His princes and his peers to servitude,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=His subjects to oppression and contempt
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And his whole kingdom into desolation.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Touching our person seek we no revenge;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Poor miserable wretches, to your death:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=The taste whereof, God of his mercy give

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=But every rub is smoothed on our way.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver

Dialogue#BARDOLPH=Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=heaven or in hell!
Dialogue#Hostess=Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's
Dialogue#Hostess=bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' made
Dialogue#Hostess=a finer end and went away an it had been any
Dialogue#Hostess=christom child; a' parted even just between twelve
Dialogue#Hostess=and one, even at the turning o' the tide: for after
Dialogue#Hostess=I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with
Dialogue#Hostess=flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knew
Dialogue#Hostess=there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as
Dialogue#Hostess=a pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,
Dialogue#Hostess=sir John!' quoth I	'what, man! be o' good
Dialogue#Hostess=cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or
Dialogue#Hostess=four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'
Dialogue#Hostess=should not think of God; I hoped there was no need
Dialogue#Hostess=to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So
Dialogue#Hostess=a' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my
Dialogue#Hostess=hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as
Dialogue#Hostess=cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and
Dialogue#Hostess=they were as cold as any stone, and so upward and
Dialogue#Hostess=upward, and all was as cold as any stone.
Dialogue#NYM=They say he cried out of sack.

Dialogue#Hostess=never liked.
Dialogue#Boy=A' said once, the devil would have him about women.
Dialogue#Hostess=A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then
Dialogue#Hostess=he was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.
Dialogue#Boy=Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick upon
Dialogue#Boy=Bardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soul
Dialogue#Boy=burning in hell-fire?
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire:
Dialogue#BARDOLPH=that's all the riches I got in his service.
Dialogue#NYM=Shall we shog? the king will be gone from
Dialogue#NYM=Southampton.
Dialogue#PISTOL=Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.
Dialogue#PISTOL=Look to my chattels and my movables:

Dialogue#EXETER=Unto the crown of France. That you may know
Dialogue#EXETER='Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
Dialogue#EXETER=Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,

Dialogue#NYM=and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives:
Dialogue#NYM=the humour of it is too hot, that is the very

Dialogue#Boy=As young as I am, I have observed these three
Dialogue#Boy=swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they
Dialogue#Boy=three, though they would serve me, could not be man
Dialogue#Boy=to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to
Dialogue#Boy=a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and
Dialogue#Boy=red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but
Dialogue#Boy=fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue
Dialogue#Boy=and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks
Dialogue#Boy=words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath
Dialogue#Boy=heard that men of few words are the best men; and
Dialogue#Boy=therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'
Dialogue#Boy=should be thought a coward: but his few bad words
Dialogue#Boy=are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never
Dialogue#Boy=broke any man's head but his own, and that was
Dialogue#Boy=against a post when he was drunk. They will steal
Dialogue#Boy=any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a
Dialogue#Boy=lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for
Dialogue#Boy=three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn
Dialogue#Boy=brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a
Dialogue#Boy=fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the
Dialogue#Boy=men would carry coals. They would have me as
Dialogue#Boy=familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their
Dialogue#Boy=handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,
Dialogue#Boy=if I should take from another's pocket to put into
Dialogue#Boy=mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I

Dialogue#FLUELLEN=By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=is the moral of it, that she is turning, and
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=the poet makes a most excellent description of it:
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=Fortune is an excellent moral.
Dialogue#PISTOL=Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;
Dialogue#PISTOL=For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:
Dialogue#PISTOL=A damned death!
Dialogue#PISTOL=Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free
Dialogue#PISTOL=And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:
Dialogue#PISTOL=But Exeter hath given the doom of death
Dialogue#PISTOL=For pax of little price.
Dialogue#PISTOL=Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:
Dialogue#PISTOL=And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
Dialogue#PISTOL=With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:
Dialogue#PISTOL=Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.
Dialogue#PISTOL=Why then, rejoice therefore.
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=at: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=desire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.

Dialogue#GOWER=ale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But
Dialogue#GOWER=you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or

Dialogue#FLUELLEN=think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that

Dialogue#MONTJOY=is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we
Dialogue#MONTJOY=could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we
Dialogue#MONTJOY=thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
Dialogue#MONTJOY=full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice
Dialogue#MONTJOY=is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see
Dialogue#MONTJOY=his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him
Dialogue#MONTJOY=therefore consider of his ransom; which must
Dialogue#MONTJOY=proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we
Dialogue#MONTJOY=have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in
Dialogue#MONTJOY=weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.
Dialogue#MONTJOY=For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the

Dialogue#MONTJOY=faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own
Dialogue#MONTJOY=person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and
Dialogue#MONTJOY=worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;

Dialogue#Constable=It is the best horse of Europe.
Dialogue#ORLEANS=Will it never be morning?
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=My lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, you
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=talk of horse and armour?
Dialogue#ORLEANS=You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=What a long night is this! I will not change my
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.
Dialogue#ORLEANS=He's of the colour of the nutmeg.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=elements of earth and water never appear in him, but
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=may call beasts.
Dialogue#Constable=Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.
Dialogue#ORLEANS=No more, cousin.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the

Dialogue#DAUPHIN=deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as

Dialogue#DAUPHIN=their particular functions and wonder at him. I
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:
Dialogue#DAUPHIN='Wonder of nature,'--
Dialogue#ORLEANS=I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=Then did they imitate that which I composed to my
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=courser, for my horse is my mistress.
Dialogue#ORLEANS=Your mistress bears well.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=Me well; which is the prescript praise and
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=perfection of a good and particular mistress.
Dialogue#Constable=Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
Dialogue#Constable=shook your back.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=So perhaps did yours.
Dialogue#Constable=Mine was not bridled.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=O then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode,
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=your straight strossers.
Dialogue#Constable=You have good judgment in horsemanship.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and ride
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=my horse to my mistress.
Dialogue#Constable=I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.
Dialogue#Constable=I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow
Dialogue#Constable=to my mistress.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN='Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, et

Dialogue#Constable=Stars, my lord.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.
Dialogue#Constable=And yet my sky shall not want.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and
Dialogue#DAUPHIN='twere more honour some were away.
Dialogue#Constable=Even as your horse bears your praises; who would
Dialogue#Constable=trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will
Dialogue#DAUPHIN=it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and

Dialogue#Constable=I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of

Dialogue#ORLEANS=He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.
Dialogue#Constable=By my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw it
Dialogue#Constable=but his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when it
Dialogue#Constable=appears, it will bate.
Dialogue#ORLEANS=Ill will never said well.

Dialogue#FLUELLEN=the greatest admiration of the universal world, when
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=wars is not kept: if you would take the pains but to
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle toddle
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=nor pibble pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you,
Dialogue#FLUELLEN=you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and the

Dialogue#FLUELLEN=of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.

Dialogue#FLUELLEN=If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating

Dialogue#COURT=Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which
Dialogue#COURT=breaks yonder?
Dialogue#BATES=I think it be: but we have no great cause to desire
Dialogue#BATES=the approach of day.
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=we shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=A friend.
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=Under what captain serve you?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=pray you, what thinks he of our estate?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=washed off the next tide.
Dialogue#BATES=He hath not told his thought to the king?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=element shows to him as it doth to me; all his
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=though his affections are higher mounted than ours,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=it, should dishearten his army.
Dialogue#BATES=He may show what outward courage he will; but I
Dialogue#BATES=believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish
Dialogue#BATES=himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he
Dialogue#BATES=were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=I think he would not wish himself any where but
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=where he is.
Dialogue#BATES=Then I would he were here alone; so should he be
Dialogue#BATES=sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=minds: methinks I could not die any where so
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=contented as in the king's company; his cause being
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=just and his quarrel honourable.
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=That's more than we know.
Dialogue#BATES=Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know
Dialogue#BATES=enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if
Dialogue#BATES=his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes
Dialogue#BATES=the crime of it out of us.
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=well that die in a battle; for how can they
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=will be a black matter for the king that led them to
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=subjection.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=So, if a son that is by his father sent about
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=servant, under his master's command transporting a
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=business of the master the author of the servant's
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=damnation: but this is not so: the king is not
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=bound to answer the particular endings of his
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=his servant; for they purpose not their death, when
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=they purpose their services. Besides, there is no
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=defeated the law and outrun native punishment,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=so that here men are punished for before-breach of
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=they feared the death, they have borne life away;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=and where they would be safe, they perish: then if
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=their damnation than he was before guilty of those
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=impieties for the which they are now visited. Every
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=that, making God so free an offer, He let him
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=others how they should prepare.
Dialogue#WILLIAMS='Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=his own head, the king is not to answer it.
Dialogue#BATES=But I do not desire he should answer for me; and
Dialogue#BATES=yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=ne'er the wiser.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=do against a monarch! you may as well go about to
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=after! come, 'tis a foolish saying.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Your reproof is something too round: I should be
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=angry with you, if the time were convenient.
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=I embrace it.
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=How shall I know thee again?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=will make it my quarrel.
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=Here's my glove: give me another of thine.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=There.
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=to me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=Thou darest as well be hanged.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Well. I will do it, though I take thee in the
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=king's company.
Dialogue#WILLIAMS=Keep thy word: fare thee well.
Dialogue#BATES=Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we have
Dialogue#BATES=French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=one, they will beat us; for they bear them on their
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=French crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=be a clipper.
Notice#Exeunt soldiers
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Our debts, our careful wives,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Our children and our sins lay on the king!

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And what have kings, that privates have not too,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Save ceremony, save general ceremony?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=O ceremony, show me but thy worth!
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=What is thy soul of adoration?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Creating awe and fear in other men?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Than they in fearing.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=With titles blown from adulation?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Will it give place to flexure and low bending?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=I am a king that find thee, and I know
Dialogue#KING HENRY V='Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=The slave, a member of the country's peace,

Dialogue#ALICE=Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=I said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush to
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=affirm it.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=are full of deceits?
Dialogue#ALICE=Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of
Dialogue#ALICE=deceits: dat is de princess.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and so
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=measure in strength. If I could win a lady at
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=armour on my back, under the correction of bragging
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=always reason themselves out again. What! a
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=shines bright and never changes, but keeps his
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=course truly. If thou would have such a one, take
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=the friend of France; for I love France so well that
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=I will not part with a village of it; I will have it
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=yours, then yours is France and you are mine.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=I cannot tell vat is dat.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=vous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, what
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=more French: I shall never move thee in French,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=unless it be to laugh at me.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, il
Dialogue#KATHARINE=est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=understand thus much English, canst thou love me?
Dialogue#KATHARINE=I cannot tell.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=when you come into your closet, you'll question this
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=her dispraise those parts in me that you love with
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=rather, gentle princess, because I love thee
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=boy, half French, half English, that shall go to
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=flower-de-luce?
Dialogue#KATHARINE=I do not know dat
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=No; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=et devin deesse?
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de
Dialogue#KATHARINE=most sage demoiselle dat is en France.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=when he got me: therefore was I created with a
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine

Dialogue#ALICE=Oui, vraiment.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your

Dialogue#KING HENRY V=You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=tongues of the French council; and they should
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=sooner persuade Harry of England than a general
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.
Notice#Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN, BURGUNDY, and other Lords
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=God save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach you
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=our princess English?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=perfectly I love her; and that is good English.
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=Is she not apt?
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=his true likeness.
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=for that. If you would conjure in her, you must
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=to consign to.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=They are then excused, my lord, when they see not
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=what they do.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=summered and warm kept, are like flies at
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=before would not abide looking on.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=latter end and she must be blind too.
Dialogue#BURGUNDY=As love is, my lord, before it loves.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=It is so: and you may, some of you, thank love for
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=for one fair French maid that stands in my way.
Dialogue#FRENCH KING=Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities
Dialogue#FRENCH KING=turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with
Dialogue#FRENCH KING=maiden walls that war hath never entered.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Shall Kate be my wife?
Dialogue#FRENCH KING=So please you.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=I am content; so the maiden cities you talk of may
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=wait on her: so the maid that stood in the way for
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=my wish shall show me the way to my will.

Dialogue#EXETER=Angliae, et Haeres Franciae.
Dialogue#FRENCH KING=Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,
Dialogue#FRENCH KING=But your request shall make me let it pass.
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=Let that one article rank with the rest;
Dialogue#KING HENRY V=And thereupon give me your daughter.
Dialogue#FRENCH KING=Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up
Dialogue#FRENCH KING=Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms
Dialogue#FRENCH KING=Of France and England, whose very shores look pale
Dialogue#FRENCH KING=With envy of each other's happiness,
Dialogue#FRENCH KING=May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction
