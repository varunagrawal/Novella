Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=What now, my son! have I not ever said
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=How that ambitious Constance would not cease
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Till she had kindled France and all the world,
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Upon the right and party of her son?
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=This might have been prevented and made whole
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=With very easy arguments of love,
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Our strong possession and our right for us.
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Your strong possession much more than your right,
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Or else it must go wrong with you and me:
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=So much my conscience whispers in your ear,
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.

Notice:Enter ROBERT and the BASTARD
Dialogue:KING JOHN=What men are you?
Dialogue:BASTARD=Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
Dialogue:BASTARD=Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,
Dialogue:BASTARD=As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,
Dialogue:BASTARD=A soldier, by the honour-giving hand
Dialogue:BASTARD=Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=What art thou?
Dialogue:ROBERT=The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
Dialogue:KING JOHN=You came not of one mother then, it seems.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Most certain of one mother, mighty king;
Dialogue:BASTARD=That is well known; and, as I think, one father:
Dialogue:BASTARD=But for the certain knowledge of that truth
Dialogue:BASTARD=I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=And wound her honour with this diffidence.
Dialogue:BASTARD=I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;
Dialogue:BASTARD=That is my brother's plea and none of mine;
Dialogue:BASTARD=The which if he can prove, a' pops me out
Dialogue:BASTARD=At least from fair five hundred pound a year:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!
Dialogue:KING JOHN=A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
Dialogue:BASTARD=I know not why, except to get the land.
Dialogue:BASTARD=But once he slander'd me with bastardy:
Dialogue:BASTARD=But whether I be as true begot or no,
Dialogue:BASTARD=That still I lay upon my mother's head,
Dialogue:BASTARD=But that I am as well begot, my liege,--
Dialogue:BASTARD=Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--
Dialogue:BASTARD=Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
Dialogue:BASTARD=If old sir Robert did beget us both
Dialogue:BASTARD=And were our father and this son like him,
Dialogue:BASTARD=O old sir Robert, father, on my knee
Dialogue:BASTARD=I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Do you not read some tokens of my son
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=In the large composition of this man?
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Mine eye hath well examined his parts
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=What doth move you to claim your brother's land?
Dialogue:BASTARD=Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
Dialogue:BASTARD=With half that face would he have all my land:
Dialogue:BASTARD=A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!
Dialogue:ROBERT=My gracious liege, when that my father lived,
Dialogue:ROBERT=Your brother did employ my father much,--
Dialogue:BASTARD=Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.
Dialogue:ROBERT=And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
Dialogue:ROBERT=To Germany, there with the emperor
Dialogue:ROBERT=To treat of high affairs touching that time.
Dialogue:ROBERT=The advantage of his absence took the king
Dialogue:ROBERT=And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;
Dialogue:ROBERT=Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,
Dialogue:ROBERT=But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
Dialogue:ROBERT=Between my father and my mother lay,
Dialogue:ROBERT=As I have heard my father speak himself,
Dialogue:ROBERT=When this same lusty gentleman was got.
Dialogue:ROBERT=Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
Dialogue:ROBERT=His lands to me, and took it on his death
Dialogue:ROBERT=That this my mother's son was none of his;
Dialogue:ROBERT=And if he were, he came into the world
Dialogue:ROBERT=Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
Dialogue:ROBERT=Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
Dialogue:ROBERT=My father's land, as was my father's will.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
Dialogue:KING JOHN=That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
Dialogue:KING JOHN=In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
Dialogue:KING JOHN=This calf bred from his cow from all the world;
Dialogue:KING JOHN=In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=My brother might not claim him; nor your father,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;
Dialogue:KING JOHN=My mother's son did get your father's heir;
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Your father's heir must have your father's land.
Dialogue:ROBERT=Shall then my father's will be of no force
Dialogue:ROBERT=To dispossess that child which is not his?
Dialogue:BASTARD=Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Than was his will to get me, as I think.
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Lord of thy presence and no land beside?
Dialogue:BASTARD=Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
Dialogue:BASTARD=And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;
Dialogue:BASTARD=And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
Dialogue:BASTARD=My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
Dialogue:BASTARD=That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
Dialogue:BASTARD=Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'
Dialogue:BASTARD=And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Would I might never stir from off this place,
Dialogue:BASTARD=I would give it every foot to have this face;
Dialogue:BASTARD=I would not be sir Nob in any case.
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=I am a soldier and now bound to France.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Our country manners give our betters way.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=What is thy name?
Dialogue:BASTARD=Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:
Dialogue:BASTARD=My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,
Dialogue:BASTARD=When I was got, sir Robert was away!
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=The very spirit of Plantagenet!
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?
Dialogue:BASTARD=Something about, a little from the right,
Dialogue:BASTARD=In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,
Dialogue:BASTARD=And have is have, however men do catch:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
Dialogue:BASTARD=And I am I, howe'er I was begot.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;
Dialogue:KING JOHN=A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed
Dialogue:KING JOHN=For France, for France, for it is more than need.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!
Dialogue:BASTARD=For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.
Notice:Exeunt all but BASTARD
Dialogue:BASTARD=A foot of honour better than I was;
Dialogue:BASTARD=But many a many foot of land the worse.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
Dialogue:BASTARD='Good den, sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--
Dialogue:BASTARD=And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
Dialogue:BASTARD=For new-made honour doth forget men's names;
Dialogue:BASTARD='Tis too respective and too sociable
Dialogue:BASTARD=For your conversion. Now your traveller,
Dialogue:BASTARD=He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
Dialogue:BASTARD=And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Why then I suck my teeth and catechise
Dialogue:BASTARD=My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
Dialogue:BASTARD=Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,
Dialogue:BASTARD='I shall beseech you'--that is question now;
Dialogue:BASTARD=And then comes answer like an Absey book:
Dialogue:BASTARD='O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;
Dialogue:BASTARD=At your employment; at your service, sir;'
Dialogue:BASTARD='No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'
Dialogue:BASTARD=And so, ere answer knows what question would,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Saving in dialogue of compliment,
Dialogue:BASTARD=And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
Dialogue:BASTARD=The Pyrenean and the river Po,
Dialogue:BASTARD=It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
Dialogue:BASTARD=But this is worshipful society
Dialogue:BASTARD=And fits the mounting spirit like myself,
Dialogue:BASTARD=For he is but a bastard to the time
Dialogue:BASTARD=That doth not smack of observation;
Dialogue:BASTARD=And so am I, whether I smack or no;
Dialogue:BASTARD=And not alone in habit and device,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
Dialogue:BASTARD=But from the inward motion to deliver
Dialogue:BASTARD=Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
Dialogue:BASTARD=For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
Dialogue:BASTARD=But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
Dialogue:BASTARD=What woman-post is this? hath she no husband
Dialogue:BASTARD=That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
Notice:Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY
Dialogue:BASTARD=O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!
Dialogue:BASTARD=What brings you here to court so hastily?
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=That holds in chase mine honour up and down?
Dialogue:BASTARD=My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?
Dialogue:BASTARD=Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?
Dialogue:BASTARD=Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.
Dialogue:BASTARD=James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
Dialogue:GURNEY=Good leave, good Philip.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Philip! sparrow: James,
Dialogue:BASTARD=There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.
Notice:Exit GURNEY
Dialogue:BASTARD=Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
Dialogue:BASTARD=Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:
Dialogue:BASTARD=We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,
Dialogue:BASTARD=To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
Dialogue:BASTARD=Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?
Dialogue:BASTARD=Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
Dialogue:BASTARD=What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.
Dialogue:BASTARD=But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;
Dialogue:BASTARD=I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;
Dialogue:BASTARD=Legitimation, name and all is gone:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Then, good my mother, let me know my father;
Dialogue:BASTARD=Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
Dialogue:BASTARD=As faithfully as I deny the devil.
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=By long and vehement suit I was seduced
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=To make room for him in my husband's bed:
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=Thou art the issue of my dear offence,
Dialogue:LADY FAULCONBRIDGE=Which was so strongly urged past my defence.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Now, by this light, were I to get again,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Madam, I would not wish a better father.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,
Dialogue:BASTARD=And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Subjected tribute to commanding love,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Against whose fury and unmatched force
Dialogue:BASTARD=The aweless lion could not wage the fight,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.
Dialogue:BASTARD=He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
Dialogue:BASTARD=May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,
Dialogue:BASTARD=With all my heart I thank thee for my father!
Dialogue:BASTARD=Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
Dialogue:BASTARD=When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;
Dialogue:BASTARD=And they shall say, when Richard me begot,
Dialogue:BASTARD=If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.

Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Bedlam, have done.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=                  I have but this to say,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=That he is not only plagued for her sin,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=But God hath made her sin and her the plague
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=On this removed issue, plague for her
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And with her plague; her sin his injury,

Dialogue:KING JOHN=Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,

Dialogue:KING PHILIP=To that owes it, namely this young prince:

Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=We will bear home that lusty blood again
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Which here we came to spout against your town,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=And leave your children, wives and you in peace.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP='Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Can hide you from our messengers of war,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Though all these English and their discipline
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=In that behalf which we have challenged it?
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Or shall we give the signal to our rage
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=And stalk in blood to our possession?
Dialogue:First Citizen=In brief, we are the king of England's subjects:
Dialogue:First Citizen=For him, and in his right, we hold this town.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.
Dialogue:First Citizen=That can we not; but he that proves the king,
Dialogue:First Citizen=To him will we prove loyal: till that time
Dialogue:First Citizen=Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Doth not the crown of England prove the king?
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And if not that, I bring you witnesses,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,--
Dialogue:BASTARD=Bastards, and else.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=To verify our title with their lives.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=As many and as well-born bloods as those,--
Dialogue:BASTARD=Some bastards too.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
Dialogue:First Citizen=Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
Dialogue:First Citizen=We for the worthiest hold the right from both.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
Dialogue:KING JOHN=That to their everlasting residence,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Amen, amen! Mount, chevaliers! to arms!

Dialogue:BASTARD=Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Teach us some fence!

Dialogue:BASTARD=Sirrah, were I at home,
Dialogue:BASTARD=At your den, sirrah, with your lioness
Dialogue:BASTARD=I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,
Dialogue:BASTARD=And make a monster of you.
Dialogue:AUSTRIA=Peace! no more.
Dialogue:BASTARD=O tremble, for you hear the lion roar.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth
Dialogue:KING JOHN=In best appointment all our regiments.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Speed then, to take advantage of the field.

Dialogue:French Herald=Who by the hand of France this day hath made
Dialogue:French Herald=Much work for tears in many an English mother,
Dialogue:French Herald=Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;
Dialogue:French Herald=Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,
Dialogue:French Herald=Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;
Dialogue:French Herald=And victory, with little loss, doth play
Dialogue:French Herald=Upon the dancing banners of the French,
Dialogue:French Herald=Who are at hand, triumphantly display'd,
Dialogue:French Herald=To enter conquerors and to proclaim
Dialogue:French Herald=Arthur of Bretagne England's king and yours.
Notice:Enter English Herald, with trumpet
Dialogue:English Herald=Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
Dialogue:English Herald=King John, your king and England's doth approach,
Dialogue:English Herald=Commander of this hot malicious day:
Dialogue:English Herald=Their armours, that march'd hence so silver-bright,
Dialogue:English Herald=Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood;
Dialogue:English Herald=There stuck no plume in any English crest
Dialogue:English Herald=That is removed by a staff of France;
Dialogue:English Herald=Our colours do return in those same hands
Dialogue:English Herald=That did display them when we first march'd forth;
Dialogue:English Herald=And, like a troop of jolly huntsmen, come
Dialogue:English Herald=Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,
Dialogue:English Herald=Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:
Dialogue:English Herald=Open your gates and gives the victors way.
Dialogue:First Citizen=Heralds, from off our towers we might behold,
Dialogue:First Citizen=From first to last, the onset and retire
Dialogue:First Citizen=Of both your armies; whose equality
Dialogue:First Citizen=By our best eyes cannot be censured:
Dialogue:First Citizen=Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows;
Dialogue:First Citizen=Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power:
Dialogue:First Citizen=Both are alike; and both alike we like.
Dialogue:First Citizen=One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,
Dialogue:First Citizen=We hold our town for neither, yet for both.
Notice:Re-enter KING JOHN and KING PHILIP, with their powers, severally
Dialogue:KING JOHN=France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Say, shall the current of our right run on?
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell
Dialogue:KING JOHN=With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Unless thou let his silver water keep
Dialogue:KING JOHN=A peaceful progress to the ocean.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=In this hot trial, more than we of France;
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=That sways the earth this climate overlooks,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Or add a royal number to the dead,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Ha, majesty! how high thy glory towers,
Dialogue:BASTARD=When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!
Dialogue:BASTARD=O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;
Dialogue:BASTARD=The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;
Dialogue:BASTARD=And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,
Dialogue:BASTARD=In undetermined differences of kings.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?
Dialogue:BASTARD=Cry, 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,
Dialogue:BASTARD=You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!
Dialogue:BASTARD=Then let confusion of one part confirm
Dialogue:BASTARD=The other's peace: till then, blows, blood and death!
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?
Dialogue:First Citizen=The king of England; when we know the king.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Know him in us, that here hold up his right.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=In us, that are our own great deputy
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And bear possession of our person here,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.
Dialogue:First Citizen=A greater power then we denies all this;
Dialogue:First Citizen=And till it be undoubted, we do lock
Dialogue:First Citizen=Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;
Dialogue:First Citizen=King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolved,
Dialogue:First Citizen=Be by some certain king purged and deposed.
Dialogue:BASTARD=By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
Dialogue:BASTARD=And stand securely on their battlements,
Dialogue:BASTARD=As in a theatre, whence they gape and point
Dialogue:BASTARD=At your industrious scenes and acts of death.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Your royal presences be ruled by me:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
Dialogue:BASTARD=Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:
Dialogue:BASTARD=By east and west let France and England mount
Dialogue:BASTARD=Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down
Dialogue:BASTARD=The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:
Dialogue:BASTARD=I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Even till unfenced desolation
Dialogue:BASTARD=Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
Dialogue:BASTARD=That done, dissever your united strengths,
Dialogue:BASTARD=And part your mingled colours once again;
Dialogue:BASTARD=Turn face to face and bloody point to point;
Dialogue:BASTARD=Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth
Dialogue:BASTARD=Out of one side her happy minion,
Dialogue:BASTARD=To whom in favour she shall give the day,
Dialogue:BASTARD=And kiss him with a glorious victory.
Dialogue:BASTARD=How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
Dialogue:BASTARD=Smacks it not something of the policy?
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And lay this Angiers even to the ground;
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Then after fight who shall be king of it?
Dialogue:BASTARD=An if thou hast the mettle of a king,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Being wronged as we are by this peevish town,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,
Dialogue:BASTARD=As we will ours, against these saucy walls;
Dialogue:BASTARD=And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Why then defy each other and pell-mell
Dialogue:BASTARD=Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
Dialogue:KING JOHN=We from the west will send destruction
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Into this city's bosom.
Dialogue:AUSTRIA=I from the north.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=                  Our thunder from the south
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.
Dialogue:BASTARD=O prudent discipline! From north to south:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:
Dialogue:BASTARD=I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!
Dialogue:First Citizen=Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,
Dialogue:First Citizen=And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;
Dialogue:First Citizen=Win you this city without stroke or wound;
Dialogue:First Citizen=Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
Dialogue:First Citizen=That here come sacrifices for the field:
Dialogue:First Citizen=Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.
Dialogue:First Citizen=That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,
Dialogue:First Citizen=Is niece to England: look upon the years
Dialogue:First Citizen=Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:
Dialogue:First Citizen=If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,
Dialogue:First Citizen=Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?
Dialogue:First Citizen=If zealous love should go in search of virtue,
Dialogue:First Citizen=Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?
Dialogue:First Citizen=If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
Dialogue:First Citizen=Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?
Dialogue:First Citizen=Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
Dialogue:First Citizen=Is the young Dauphin every way complete:
Dialogue:First Citizen=If not complete of, say he is not she;
Dialogue:First Citizen=And she again wants nothing, to name want,
Dialogue:First Citizen=If want it be not that she is not he:
Dialogue:First Citizen=He is the half part of a blessed man,
Dialogue:First Citizen=Left to be finished by such as she;
Dialogue:First Citizen=And she a fair divided excellence,
Dialogue:First Citizen=Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.
Dialogue:First Citizen=O, two such silver currents, when they join,
Dialogue:First Citizen=Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
Dialogue:First Citizen=And two such shores to two such streams made one,
Dialogue:First Citizen=Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
Dialogue:First Citizen=To these two princes, if you marry them.
Dialogue:First Citizen=This union shall do more than battery can
Dialogue:First Citizen=To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,
Dialogue:First Citizen=With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,
Dialogue:First Citizen=The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,
Dialogue:First Citizen=And give you entrance: but without this match,
Dialogue:First Citizen=The sea enraged is not half so deaf,
Dialogue:First Citizen=Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
Dialogue:First Citizen=More free from motion, no, not Death himself
Dialogue:First Citizen=In moral fury half so peremptory,
Dialogue:First Citizen=As we to keep this city.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Here's a stay
Dialogue:BASTARD=That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
Dialogue:BASTARD=Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,
Dialogue:BASTARD=That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
Dialogue:BASTARD=As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
Dialogue:BASTARD=What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
Dialogue:BASTARD=He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;
Dialogue:BASTARD=He gives the bastinado with his tongue:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
Dialogue:BASTARD=But buffets better than a fist of France:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words
Dialogue:BASTARD=Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Give with our niece a dowry large enough:
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=I see a yielding in the looks of France;
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Are capable of this ambition,
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Cool and congeal again to what it was.
Dialogue:First Citizen=Why answer not the double majesties
Dialogue:First Citizen=This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Speak England first, that hath been forward first
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=To speak unto this city: what say you?
Dialogue:KING JOHN=If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:
Dialogue:KING JOHN=For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And all that we upon this side the sea,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Except this city now by us besieged,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Find liable to our crown and dignity,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
Dialogue:KING JOHN=In titles, honours and promotions,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=As she in beauty, education, blood,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Holds hand with any princess of the world.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=What say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face.
Dialogue:LEWIS=I do, my lord; and in her eye I find
Dialogue:LEWIS=A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
Dialogue:LEWIS=The shadow of myself form'd in her eye:
Dialogue:LEWIS=Which being but the shadow of your son,
Dialogue:LEWIS=Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:
Dialogue:LEWIS=I do protest I never loved myself
Dialogue:LEWIS=Till now infixed I beheld myself
Dialogue:LEWIS=Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.
Notice:Whispers with BLANCH
Dialogue:BASTARD=Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!
Dialogue:BASTARD=Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!
Dialogue:BASTARD=And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy
Dialogue:BASTARD=Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,
Dialogue:BASTARD=That hang'd and drawn and quartered, there should be
Dialogue:BASTARD=In such a love so vile a lout as he.
Dialogue:BLANCH=My uncle's will in this respect is mine:
Dialogue:BLANCH=If he see aught in you that makes him like,
Dialogue:BLANCH=That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,
Dialogue:BLANCH=I can with ease translate it to my will;
Dialogue:BLANCH=Or if you will, to speak more properly,
Dialogue:BLANCH=I will enforce it easily to my love.
Dialogue:BLANCH=Further I will not flatter you, my lord,
Dialogue:BLANCH=That all I see in you is worthy love,
Dialogue:BLANCH=Than this; that nothing do I see in you,
Dialogue:BLANCH=Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,
Dialogue:BLANCH=That I can find should merit any hate.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=What say these young ones? What say you my niece?
Dialogue:BLANCH=That she is bound in honour still to do
Dialogue:BLANCH=What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Speak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?
Dialogue:LEWIS=Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;
Dialogue:LEWIS=For I do love her most unfeignedly.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=With her to thee; and this addition more,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Command thy son and daughter to join hands.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.
Dialogue:AUSTRIA=And your lips too; for I am well assured
Dialogue:AUSTRIA=That I did so when I was first assured.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Let in that amity which you have made;
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=For at Saint Mary's chapel presently
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=I know she is not, for this match made up
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Her presence would have interrupted much:
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.
Dialogue:LEWIS=She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=And, by my faith, this league that we have made
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Will give her sadness very little cure.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Brother of England, how may we content
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=This widow lady? In her right we came;
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=To our own vantage.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=We will heal up all;
Dialogue:KING JOHN=For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town
Dialogue:KING JOHN=We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Some speedy messenger bid her repair
Dialogue:KING JOHN=To our solemnity: I trust we shall,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=If not fill up the measure of her will,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Yet in some measure satisfy her so
Dialogue:KING JOHN=That we shall stop her exclamation.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.
Notice:Exeunt all but the BASTARD
Dialogue:BASTARD=Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
Dialogue:BASTARD=John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Hath willingly departed with a part,
Dialogue:BASTARD=And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
Dialogue:BASTARD=As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
Dialogue:BASTARD=With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
Dialogue:BASTARD=That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,
Dialogue:BASTARD=That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Who, having no external thing to lose
Dialogue:BASTARD=But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,
Dialogue:BASTARD=That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Commodity, the bias of the world,
Dialogue:BASTARD=The world, who of itself is peised well,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Made to run even upon even ground,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
Dialogue:BASTARD=This sway of motion, this Commodity,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Makes it take head from all indifferency,
Dialogue:BASTARD=From all direction, purpose, course, intent:
Dialogue:BASTARD=And this same bias, this Commodity,
Dialogue:BASTARD=This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
Dialogue:BASTARD=From a resolved and honourable war,
Dialogue:BASTARD=To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
Dialogue:BASTARD=And why rail I on this Commodity?
Dialogue:BASTARD=But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,
Dialogue:BASTARD=When his fair angels would salute my palm;
Dialogue:BASTARD=But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
Dialogue:BASTARD=And say there is no sin but to be rich;
Dialogue:BASTARD=And being rich, my virtue then shall be
Dialogue:BASTARD=To say there is no vice but beggary.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Since kings break faith upon commodity,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.

Dialogue:CONSTANCE=It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard:
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so:
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Is but the vain breath of a common man:
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Believe me, I do not believe thee, man;
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=I have a king's oath to the contrary.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=For I am sick and capable of fears,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,

Dialogue:SALISBURY=But spoke the harm that is by others done?

Dialogue:ARTHUR=I do beseech you, madam, be content.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=I would not care, I then would be content,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=She is corrupted, changed and won from thee;
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And leave those woes alone which I alone
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Am bound to under-bear.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Pardon me, madam,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=I may not go without you to the kings.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee:
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=To me and to the state of my great grief
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=That no supporter but the huge firm earth
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.

Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Is cold in amity and painted peace,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And our oppression hath made up this league.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!

Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Do in his name religiously demand
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Why thou against the church, our holy mother,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Of Canterbury, from that holy see?
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=This, in our foresaid holy father's name,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=What earthy name to interrogatories
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name
Dialogue:KING JOHN=So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=To charge me to an answer, as the pope.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
Dialogue:KING JOHN=But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=So under Him that great supremacy,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Without the assistance of a mortal hand:
Dialogue:KING JOHN=So tell the pope, all reverence set apart
Dialogue:KING JOHN=To him and his usurp'd authority.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Though you and all the kings of Christendom
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Though you and all the rest so grossly led
Dialogue:KING JOHN=This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Against the pope and count his friends my foes.
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Then, by the lawful power that I have,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate.
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=From his allegiance to an heretic;
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Canonized and worshipped as a saint,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=That takes away by any secret course
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Thy hateful life.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=                  O, lawful let it be
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Good father cardinal, cry thou amen
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=To my keen curses; for without my wrong
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And for mine too: when law can do no right,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Let go the hand of that arch-heretic;
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=And raise the power of France upon his head,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Look to that, devil; lest that France repent,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.
Dialogue:AUSTRIA=King Philip, listen to the cardinal.
Dialogue:BASTARD=And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.
Dialogue:AUSTRIA=Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs, Because--
Dialogue:BASTARD=        Your breeches best may carry them.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=What should he say, but as the cardinal?
Dialogue:LEWIS=Bethink you, father; for the difference
Dialogue:LEWIS=Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,
Dialogue:LEWIS=Or the light loss of England for a friend:
Dialogue:LEWIS=Forego the easier.
Dialogue:BLANCH=                  That's the curse of Rome.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.
Dialogue:BLANCH=The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,
Dialogue:BLANCH=But from her need.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=                  O, if thou grant my need,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Which only lives but by the death of faith,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=That need must needs infer this principle,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=That faith would live again by death of need.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!
Dialogue:KING JOHN=The king is moved, and answers not to this.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=O, be removed from him, and answer well!
Dialogue:AUSTRIA=Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=I am perplex'd, and know not what to say.
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Good reverend father, make my person yours,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=This royal hand and mine are newly knit,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=And the conjunction of our inward souls
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Married in league, coupled and linked together
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=With all religious strength of sacred vows;
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=The latest breath that gave the sound of words
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=And even before this truce, but new before,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=No longer than we well could wash our hands
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=To clap this royal bargain up of peace,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and over-stain'd
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=The fearful difference of incensed kings:
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Make such unconstant children of ourselves,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=And make a riot on the gentle brow
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=My reverend father, let it not be so!
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=To do your pleasure and continue friends.
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=All form is formless, order orderless,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Save what is opposite to England's love.
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=A mother's curse, on her revolting son.
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=That is, to be the champion of our church!
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=And may not be performed by thyself,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Is not amiss when it is truly done,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=The truth is then most done not doing it:
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=The better act of purposes mistook
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Is to mistake again; though indirect,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=It is religion that doth make vows kept;
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=But thou hast sworn against religion,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=And makest an oath the surety for thy truth
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Therefore thy later vows against thy first
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=And better conquest never canst thou make
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Against these giddy loose suggestions:
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Upon which better part our prayers come in,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=The peril of our curses light on thee
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=But in despair die under their black weight.
Dialogue:AUSTRIA=Rebellion, flat rebellion!
Dialogue:BASTARD=Will't not be?
Dialogue:BASTARD=Will not a calfs-skin stop that mouth of thine?
Dialogue:LEWIS=Father, to arms!
Dialogue:BLANCH=                  Upon thy wedding-day?
Dialogue:BLANCH=Against the blood that thou hast married?
Dialogue:BLANCH=What, shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men?
Dialogue:BLANCH=Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,
Dialogue:BLANCH=Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?
Dialogue:BLANCH=O husband, hear me! ay, alack, how new
Dialogue:BLANCH=Is husband in my mouth! even for that name,
Dialogue:BLANCH=Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,
Dialogue:BLANCH=Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms
Dialogue:BLANCH=Against mine uncle.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=O, upon my knee,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Forethought by heaven!
Dialogue:BLANCH=Now shall I see thy love: what motive may
Dialogue:BLANCH=Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=His honour: O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!
Dialogue:LEWIS=I muse your majesty doth seem so cold,
Dialogue:LEWIS=When such profound respects do pull you on.
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=I will denounce a curse upon his head.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=O fair return of banish'd majesty!
Dialogue:QUEEN ELINOR=O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
Dialogue:KING JOHN=France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Is it as he will? well then, France shall rue.
Dialogue:BLANCH=The sun's o'ercast with blood: fair day, adieu!
Dialogue:BLANCH=Which is the side that I must go withal?
Dialogue:BLANCH=I am with both: each army hath a hand;
Dialogue:BLANCH=And in their rage, I having hold of both,
Dialogue:BLANCH=They swirl asunder and dismember me.
Dialogue:BLANCH=Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;
Dialogue:BLANCH=Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;
Dialogue:BLANCH=Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;
Dialogue:BLANCH=Grandam, I will not wish thy fortunes thrive:
Dialogue:BLANCH=Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose
Dialogue:BLANCH=Assured loss before the match be play'd.
Dialogue:LEWIS=Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.
Dialogue:BLANCH=There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Cousin, go draw our puissance together.

Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Thy rage sham burn thee up, and thou shalt turn

Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Then with a passion would I shake the world;
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Which scorns a modern invocation.
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Thou art not holy to belie me so;
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=For then, 'tis like I should forget myself:
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=O, if I could, what grief should I forget!
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=For being not mad but sensible of grief,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=My reasonable part produces reason
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=How I may be deliver'd of these woes,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And teaches me to kill or hang myself:
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=If I were mad, I should forget my son,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=I am not mad; too well, too well I feel
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=The different plague of each calamity.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Do glue themselves in sociable grief,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Sticking together in calamity.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=To England, if you will.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=Bind up your hairs.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
Dialogue:CONSTANCE='O that these hands could so redeem my son,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=As they have given these hairs their liberty!'
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=But now I envy at their liberty,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And will again commit them to their bonds,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Because my poor child is a prisoner.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And, father cardinal, I have heard you say
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=If that be true, I shall see my boy again;
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=To him that did but yesterday suspire,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=There was not such a gracious creature born.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And chase the native beauty from his cheek
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=And so he'll die; and, rising so again,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=I shall not know him: therefore never, never
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=He talks to me that never had a son.
Dialogue:KING PHILIP=You are as fond of grief as of your child.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=I could give better comfort than you do.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=I will not keep this form upon my head,
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=When there is such disorder in my wit.
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!
Dialogue:CONSTANCE=My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!

Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=So be it, for it cannot be but so.
Dialogue:LEWIS=But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,

Dialogue:LEWIS=And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=How green you are and fresh in this old world!
Dialogue:CARDINAL PANDULPH=John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;

Dialogue:ARTHUR=Yet, I remember, when I was in France,
Dialogue:ARTHUR=Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,

Dialogue:HUBERT=Young boy, I must.
Dialogue:ARTHUR=                  And will you?
Dialogue:HUBERT=And I will.

Dialogue:ARTHUR=Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
Dialogue:ARTHUR=The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,

Dialogue:BASTARD=The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:
Dialogue:BASTARD=Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,
Dialogue:BASTARD=With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
Dialogue:BASTARD=And others more, going to seek the grave
Dialogue:BASTARD=Of Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night
Dialogue:BASTARD=On your suggestion.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Gentle kinsman, go,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And thrust thyself into their companies:
Dialogue:KING JOHN=I have a way to win their loves again;
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Bring them before me.
Dialogue:BASTARD=I will seek them out.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=O, let me have no subject enemies,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=When adverse foreigners affright my towns
Dialogue:KING JOHN=With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And fly like thought from them to me again.
Dialogue:BASTARD=The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.

Dialogue:HUBERT=My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;
Dialogue:HUBERT=Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about
Dialogue:HUBERT=The other four in wondrous motion.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Five moons!
Dialogue:HUBERT=Old men and beldams in the streets
Dialogue:HUBERT=Do prophesy upon it dangerously:
Dialogue:HUBERT=Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:
Dialogue:HUBERT=And when they talk of him, they shake their heads
Dialogue:HUBERT=And whisper one another in the ear;
Dialogue:HUBERT=And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
Dialogue:HUBERT=Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,
Dialogue:HUBERT=With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
Dialogue:HUBERT=I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
Dialogue:HUBERT=The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
Dialogue:HUBERT=With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;
Dialogue:HUBERT=Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
Dialogue:HUBERT=Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
Dialogue:HUBERT=Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
Dialogue:HUBERT=Told of a many thousand warlike French
Dialogue:HUBERT=That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:
Dialogue:HUBERT=Another lean unwash'd artificer
Dialogue:HUBERT=Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause
Dialogue:KING JOHN=To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
Dialogue:HUBERT=No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?
Dialogue:KING JOHN=It is the curse of kings to be attended
Dialogue:KING JOHN=By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
Dialogue:KING JOHN=To break within the bloody house of life,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And on the winking of authority
Dialogue:KING JOHN=To understand a law, to know the meaning
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns
Dialogue:KING JOHN=More upon humour than advised respect.
Dialogue:HUBERT=Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Witness against us to damnation!
Dialogue:KING JOHN=How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=This murder had not come into my mind:
Dialogue:KING JOHN=But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Finding thee fit for bloody villany,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And thou, to be endeared to a king,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.
Dialogue:HUBERT=My lord--
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
Dialogue:KING JOHN=When I spake darkly what I purposed,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=As bid me tell my tale in express words,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:
Dialogue:KING JOHN=But thou didst understand me by my signs
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And didst in signs again parley with sin;
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And consequently thy rude hand to act
Dialogue:KING JOHN=The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Out of my sight, and never see me more!
Dialogue:KING JOHN=My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Hostility and civil tumult reigns
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Between my conscience and my cousin's death.
Dialogue:HUBERT=Arm you against your other enemies,
Dialogue:HUBERT=I'll make a peace between your soul and you.
Dialogue:HUBERT=Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine
Dialogue:HUBERT=Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
Dialogue:HUBERT=Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
Dialogue:HUBERT=Within this bosom never enter'd yet
Dialogue:HUBERT=The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;
Dialogue:HUBERT=And you have slander'd nature in my form,
Dialogue:HUBERT=Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,
Dialogue:HUBERT=Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
Dialogue:HUBERT=Than to be butcher of an innocent child.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Throw this report on their incensed rage,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And make them tame to their obedience!
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Forgive the comment that my passion made
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
Dialogue:KING JOHN=And foul imaginary eyes of blood
Dialogue:KING JOHN=Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
Dialogue:KING JOHN=O, answer not, but to my closet bring
Dialogue:KING JOHN=The angry lords with all expedient haste.

Dialogue:PEMBROKE=Who brought that letter from the cardinal?
Dialogue:SALISBURY=The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,

Notice:Enter the BASTARD
Dialogue:BASTARD=Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
Dialogue:BASTARD=The king by me requests your presence straight.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:

Dialogue:SALISBURY=With our pure honours, nor attend the foot
Dialogue:SALISBURY=That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.

Dialogue:PEMBROKE=Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
Dialogue:BASTARD='Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=This is the prison. What is he lies here?
Notice:Seeing ARTHUR
Dialogue:PEMBROKE=O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
Dialogue:PEMBROKE=The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.
Dialogue:BIGOT=Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
Dialogue:BIGOT=Found it too precious-princely for a grave.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Or have you read or heard? or could you think?
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Or do you almost think, although you see,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=That you do see? could thought, without this object,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Form such another? This is the very top,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Presented to the tears of soft remorse.
Dialogue:PEMBROKE=All murders past do stand excused in this:
Dialogue:PEMBROKE=And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
Dialogue:PEMBROKE=Shall give a holiness, a purity,
Dialogue:PEMBROKE=To the yet unbegotten sin of times;
Dialogue:PEMBROKE=And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,
Dialogue:PEMBROKE=Exampled by this heinous spectacle.
Dialogue:BASTARD=It is a damned and a bloody work;

Dialogue:BASTARD=If that it be the work of any hand.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=If that it be the work of any hand!
Dialogue:SALISBURY=We had a kind of light what would ensue:
Dialogue:SALISBURY=It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;

Dialogue:SALISBURY=From whose obedience I forbid my soul,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=And breathing to his breathless excellence

Dialogue:HUBERT=My innocent life against an emperor.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Thou art a murderer.
Dialogue:HUBERT=Do not prove me so;

Dialogue:HUBERT=Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.
Dialogue:PEMBROKE=Cut him to pieces.
Dialogue:BASTARD=                  Keep the peace, I say.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:
Dialogue:BASTARD=If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,
Dialogue:BASTARD=I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;
Dialogue:BASTARD=Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,
Dialogue:BASTARD=That you shall think the devil is come from hell.

Dialogue:HUBERT='Tis not an hour since I left him well:
Dialogue:HUBERT=I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep
Dialogue:HUBERT=My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
Dialogue:SALISBURY=For villany is not without such rheum;

Dialogue:SALISBURY=Like rivers of remorse and innocency.
Dialogue:SALISBURY=Away with me, all you whose souls abhor
Dialogue:SALISBURY=The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;
Dialogue:SALISBURY=For I am stifled with this smell of sin.

Dialogue:HUBERT=Do but hear me, sir.
Dialogue:BASTARD=Ha! I'll tell thee what;
Dialogue:BASTARD=Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;
Dialogue:BASTARD=Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:

Dialogue:BASTARD=As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.
Dialogue:HUBERT=Upon my soul--
Dialogue:BASTARD=                  If thou didst but consent
Dialogue:BASTARD=To this most cruel act, do but despair;

Dialogue:BASTARD=The youth says well. Now hear our English king;
Dialogue:BASTARD=For thus his royalty doth speak in me.

Dialogue:BASTARD=And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Not trusting to this halting legate here,
Dialogue:BASTARD=Whom he hath used rather for sport than need
Dialogue:BASTARD=Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
Dialogue:BASTARD=A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
