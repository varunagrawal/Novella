Banner:SCENE I. Rome. A street.
Notice:Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Is this a holiday? what! know you not,
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Being mechanical, you ought not walk
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Upon a labouring day without the sign
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
Dialogue:First Commoner=Why, sir, a carpenter.
Dialogue:MARULLUS=Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
Dialogue:MARULLUS=What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
Dialogue:MARULLUS=You, sir, what trade are you?
Dialogue:Second Commoner=Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
Dialogue:Second Commoner=as you would say, a cobbler.
Dialogue:MARULLUS=But what trade art thou? answer me directly.
Dialogue:Second Commoner=A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
Dialogue:Second Commoner=conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
Dialogue:MARULLUS=What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?
Dialogue:Second Commoner=Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,
Dialogue:Second Commoner=if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
Dialogue:MARULLUS=What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!
Dialogue:Second Commoner=Why, sir, cobble you.
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
Dialogue:Second Commoner=Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I
Dialogue:Second Commoner=meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's
Dialogue:Second Commoner=matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon
Dialogue:Second Commoner=to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I
Dialogue:Second Commoner=recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
Dialogue:Second Commoner=neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
Dialogue:Second Commoner=Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself
Dialogue:Second Commoner=into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,
Dialogue:Second Commoner=to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
Dialogue:MARULLUS=Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
Dialogue:MARULLUS=What tributaries follow him to Rome,
Dialogue:MARULLUS=To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
Dialogue:MARULLUS=You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
Dialogue:MARULLUS=O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
Dialogue:MARULLUS=Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
Dialogue:MARULLUS=Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
Dialogue:MARULLUS=To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
Dialogue:MARULLUS=Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
Dialogue:MARULLUS=The livelong day, with patient expectation,
Dialogue:MARULLUS=To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
Dialogue:MARULLUS=And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Dialogue:MARULLUS=Have you not made an universal shout,
Dialogue:MARULLUS=That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
Dialogue:MARULLUS=To hear the replication of your sounds
Dialogue:MARULLUS=Made in her concave shores?
Dialogue:MARULLUS=And do you now put on your best attire?
Dialogue:MARULLUS=And do you now cull out a holiday?
Dialogue:MARULLUS=And do you now strew flowers in his way
Dialogue:MARULLUS=That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
Dialogue:MARULLUS=Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Dialogue:MARULLUS=Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
Dialogue:MARULLUS=That needs must light on this ingratitude.
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Into the channel, till the lowest stream
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
Notice:Exeunt all the Commoners
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=See whether their basest metal be not moved;
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
Dialogue:This way will I=disrobe the images,
Dialogue:This way will I=If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.
Dialogue:MARULLUS=May we do so?
Dialogue:MARULLUS=You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=It is no matter; let no images
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=Who else would soar above the view of men
Dialogue:FLAVIUS=And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
Notice:Exeunt
Banner:SCENE II. A public place.
Notice:Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;  CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer
Dialogue:CAESAR=Calpurnia!
Dialogue:CASCA=         Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
Dialogue:CAESAR=Calpurnia!
Dialogue:CALPURNIA=Here, my lord.
Dialogue:CAESAR=Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
Dialogue:CAESAR=When he doth run his course. Antonius!
Dialogue:ANTONY=Caesar, my lord?
Dialogue:CAESAR=Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
Dialogue:CAESAR=To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,
Dialogue:CAESAR=The barren, touched in this holy chase,
Dialogue:CAESAR=Shake off their sterile curse.
Dialogue:ANTONY=I shall remember:
Dialogue:ANTONY=When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.
Dialogue:CAESAR=Set on; and leave no ceremony out.
Notice:Flourish
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Caesar!
Dialogue:CAESAR=Ha! who calls?
Dialogue:CASCA=Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!
Dialogue:CAESAR=Who is it in the press that calls on me?
Dialogue:CAESAR=I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
Dialogue:CAESAR=Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Beware the ides of March.
Dialogue:CAESAR=What man is that?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
Dialogue:CAESAR=Set him before me; let me see his face.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
Dialogue:CAESAR=What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.
Dialogue:Soothsayer=Beware the ides of March.
Dialogue:CAESAR=He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
Notice:Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Will you go see the order of the course?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Not I.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I pray you, do.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I'll leave you.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I have not from your eyes that gentleness
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And show of love as I was wont to have:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Over your friend that loves you.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Cassius,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I turn the trouble of my countenance
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Of late with passions of some difference,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Conceptions only proper to myself,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Nor construe any further my neglect,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Forgets the shows of love to other men.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=But by reflection, by some other things.
Dialogue:CASSIUS='Tis just:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Where many of the best respect in Rome,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That you would have me seek into myself
Dialogue:BRUTUS=For that which is not in me?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And since you know you cannot see yourself
Dialogue:CASSIUS=So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Will modestly discover to yourself
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That of yourself which you yet know not of.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Were I a common laugher, or did use
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To stale with ordinary oaths my love
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To every new protester; if you know
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And after scandal them, or if you know
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That I profess myself in banqueting
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
Notice:Flourish, and shout
Dialogue:BRUTUS=What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Choose Caesar for their king.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Ay, do you fear it?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Then must I think you would not have it so.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=What is it that you would impart to me?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=If it be aught toward the general good,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And I will look on both indifferently,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=For let the gods so speed me as I love
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The name of honour more than I fear death.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=As well as I do know your outward favour.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Well, honour is the subject of my story.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I cannot tell what you and other men
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Think of this life; but, for my single self,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I had as lief not be as live to be
Dialogue:CASSIUS=In awe of such a thing as I myself.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=We both have fed as well, and we can both
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Leap in with me into this angry flood,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
Dialogue:CASSIUS=With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
Dialogue:CASSIUS=The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Is now become a god, and Cassius is
Dialogue:CASSIUS=A wretched creature and must bend his body,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=He had a fever when he was in Spain,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And when the fit was on him, I did mark
Dialogue:CASSIUS=How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=His coward lips did from their colour fly,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
Dialogue:CASSIUS=As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
Dialogue:CASSIUS=A man of such a feeble temper should
Dialogue:CASSIUS=So get the start of the majestic world
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And bear the palm alone.
Notice:Shout. Flourish
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Another general shout!
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I do believe that these applauses are
Dialogue:BRUTUS=For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Like a Colossus, and we petty men
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Walk under his huge legs and peep about
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Men at some time are masters of their fates:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=When went there by an age, since the great flood,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=But it was famed with more than with one man?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=When there is in it but one only man.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
Dialogue:CASSIUS=The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
Dialogue:CASSIUS=As easily as a king.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=What you would work me to, I have some aim:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=How I have thought of this and of these times,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Be any further moved. What you have said
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I will consider; what you have to say
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I will with patience hear, and find a time
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Brutus had rather be a villager
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Under these hard conditions as this time
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Is like to lay upon us.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I am glad that my weak words
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The games are done and Caesar is returning.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
Dialogue:CASSIUS=What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
Notice:Re-enter CAESAR and his Train
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And all the rest look like a chidden train:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
Dialogue:BRUTUS=As we have seen him in the Capitol,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Casca will tell us what the matter is.
Dialogue:CAESAR=Antonius!
Dialogue:ANTONY=Caesar?
Dialogue:CAESAR=Let me have men about me that are fat;
Dialogue:CAESAR=Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
Dialogue:CAESAR=Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
Dialogue:CAESAR=He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
Dialogue:ANTONY=He is a noble Roman and well given.
Dialogue:CAESAR=Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
Dialogue:CAESAR=Yet if my name were liable to fear,
Dialogue:CAESAR=I do not know the man I should avoid
Dialogue:CAESAR=So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
Dialogue:CAESAR=He is a great observer and he looks
Dialogue:CAESAR=Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
Dialogue:CAESAR=As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
Dialogue:CAESAR=Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
Dialogue:CAESAR=As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
Dialogue:CAESAR=That could be moved to smile at any thing.
Dialogue:CAESAR=Such men as he be never at heart's ease
Dialogue:CAESAR=Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
Dialogue:CAESAR=And therefore are they very dangerous.
Dialogue:CAESAR=I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
Dialogue:CAESAR=Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
Dialogue:CAESAR=Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
Dialogue:CAESAR=And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
Notice:Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA
Dialogue:CASCA=You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That Caesar looks so sad.
Dialogue:CASCA=Why, you were with him, were you not?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
Dialogue:CASCA=Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
Dialogue:CASCA=offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
Dialogue:CASCA=thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=What was the second noise for?
Dialogue:CASCA=Why, for that too.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
Dialogue:CASCA=Why, for that too.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Was the crown offered him thrice?
Dialogue:CASCA=Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
Dialogue:CASCA=time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
Dialogue:CASCA=mine honest neighbours shouted.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Who offered him the crown?
Dialogue:CASCA=Why, Antony.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
Dialogue:CASCA=I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
Dialogue:CASCA=it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
Dialogue:CASCA=Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
Dialogue:CASCA=neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told
Dialogue:CASCA=you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
Dialogue:CASCA=thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
Dialogue:CASCA=offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
Dialogue:CASCA=but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
Dialogue:CASCA=fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
Dialogue:CASCA=time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
Dialogue:CASCA=refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
Dialogue:CASCA=chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
Dialogue:CASCA=and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
Dialogue:CASCA=Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
Dialogue:CASCA=Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
Dialogue:CASCA=for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
Dialogue:CASCA=opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?
Dialogue:CASCA=He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
Dialogue:CASCA=mouth, and was speechless.
Dialogue:BRUTUS='Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
Dialogue:CASCA=I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,
Dialogue:CASCA=Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
Dialogue:CASCA=clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
Dialogue:CASCA=displeased them, as they use to do the players in
Dialogue:CASCA=the theatre, I am no true man.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=What said he when he came unto himself?
Dialogue:CASCA=Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
Dialogue:CASCA=common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
Dialogue:CASCA=plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
Dialogue:CASCA=throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
Dialogue:CASCA=occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
Dialogue:CASCA=I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
Dialogue:CASCA=he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
Dialogue:CASCA=If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
Dialogue:CASCA=their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
Dialogue:CASCA=or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
Dialogue:CASCA=soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
Dialogue:CASCA=there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
Dialogue:CASCA=stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And after that, he came, thus sad, away?
Dialogue:CASCA=Ay.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Did Cicero say any thing?
Dialogue:CASCA=Ay, he spoke Greek.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To what effect?
Dialogue:CASCA=Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the
Dialogue:CASCA=face again: but those that understood him smiled at
Dialogue:CASCA=one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
Dialogue:CASCA=part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
Dialogue:CASCA=news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
Dialogue:CASCA=off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
Dialogue:CASCA=well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
Dialogue:CASCA=remember it.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?
Dialogue:CASCA=No, I am promised forth.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Will you dine with me to-morrow?
Dialogue:CASCA=Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
Dialogue:CASCA=worth the eating.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Good: I will expect you.
Dialogue:CASCA=Do so. Farewell, both.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:BRUTUS=What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
Dialogue:BRUTUS=He was quick mettle when he went to school.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=So is he now in execution
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Of any bold or noble enterprise,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=However he puts on this tardy form.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Which gives men stomach to digest his words
Dialogue:CASSIUS=With better appetite.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I will come home to you; or, if you will,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I will do so: till then, think of the world.
Notice:Exit BRUTUS
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Thy honourable metal may be wrought
Dialogue:CASSIUS=From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=He should not humour me. I will this night,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=In several hands, in at his windows throw,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=As if they came from several citizens,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Writings all tending to the great opinion
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
Notice:Exit
Banner:SCENE III. The same. A street.
Notice:Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides, CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO
Dialogue:CICERO=Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
Dialogue:CICERO=Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?
Dialogue:CASCA=Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
Dialogue:CASCA=Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
Dialogue:CASCA=I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
Dialogue:CASCA=Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
Dialogue:CASCA=The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
Dialogue:CASCA=To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
Dialogue:CASCA=But never till to-night, never till now,
Dialogue:CASCA=Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
Dialogue:CASCA=Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
Dialogue:CASCA=Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
Dialogue:CASCA=Incenses them to send destruction.
Dialogue:CICERO=Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?
Dialogue:CASCA=A common slave--you know him well by sight--
Dialogue:CASCA=Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
Dialogue:CASCA=Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,
Dialogue:CASCA=Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
Dialogue:CASCA=Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
Dialogue:CASCA=Against the Capitol I met a lion,
Dialogue:CASCA=Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
Dialogue:CASCA=Without annoying me: and there were drawn
Dialogue:CASCA=Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
Dialogue:CASCA=Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
Dialogue:CASCA=Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
Dialogue:CASCA=And yesterday the bird of night did sit
Dialogue:CASCA=Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
Dialogue:CASCA=Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
Dialogue:CASCA=Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
Dialogue:CASCA='These are their reasons; they are natural;'
Dialogue:CASCA=For, I believe, they are portentous things
Dialogue:CASCA=Unto the climate that they point upon.
Dialogue:CICERO=Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
Dialogue:CICERO=But men may construe things after their fashion,
Dialogue:CICERO=Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
Dialogue:CICERO=Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?
Dialogue:CASCA=He doth; for he did bid Antonius
Dialogue:CASCA=Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.
Dialogue:CICERO=Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
Dialogue:CICERO=Is not to walk in.
Dialogue:CASCA=Farewell, Cicero.
Notice:Exit CICERO
Notice:Enter CASSIUS
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Who's there?
Dialogue:CASCA=                  A Roman.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Casca, by your voice.
Dialogue:CASCA=Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=A very pleasing night to honest men.
Dialogue:CASCA=Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Submitting me unto the perilous night,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
Dialogue:CASSIUS=The breast of heaven, I did present myself
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Even in the aim and very flash of it.
Dialogue:CASCA=But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
Dialogue:CASCA=It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
Dialogue:CASCA=When the most mighty gods by tokens send
Dialogue:CASCA=Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That should be in a Roman you do want,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=But if you would consider the true cause
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Why old men fool and children calculate,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Why all these things change from their ordinance
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Their natures and preformed faculties
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To make them instruments of fear and warning
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Unto some monstrous state.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Most like this dreadful night,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
Dialogue:CASSIUS=As doth the lion in the Capitol,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=A man no mightier than thyself or me
Dialogue:CASSIUS=In personal action, yet prodigious grown
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
Dialogue:CASCA='Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Let it be who it is: for Romans now
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
Dialogue:CASCA=Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
Dialogue:CASCA=Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
Dialogue:CASCA=And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
Dialogue:CASCA=In every place, save here in Italy.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I know where I will wear this dagger then;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=If I know this, know all the world besides,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That part of tyranny that I do bear
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I can shake off at pleasure.
Notice:Thunder still
Dialogue:CASCA=So can I:
Dialogue:CASCA=So every bondman in his own hand bears
Dialogue:CASCA=The power to cancel his captivity.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
Dialogue:CASSIUS=For the base matter to illuminate
Dialogue:CASSIUS=So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Before a willing bondman; then I know
Dialogue:CASSIUS=My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And dangers are to me indifferent.
Dialogue:CASCA=You speak to Casca, and to such a man
Dialogue:CASCA=That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
Dialogue:CASCA=Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
Dialogue:CASCA=And I will set this foot of mine as far
Dialogue:CASCA=As who goes farthest.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=There's a bargain made.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To undergo with me an enterprise
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And I do know, by this, they stay for me
Dialogue:CASSIUS=In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=There is no stir or walking in the streets;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And the complexion of the element
Dialogue:CASSIUS=In favour's like the work we have in hand,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
Dialogue:CASCA=Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
Dialogue:CASSIUS='Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=He is a friend.
Notice:Enter CINNA
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Cinna, where haste you so?
Dialogue:CINNA=To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=No, it is Casca; one incorporate
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
Dialogue:CINNA=I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
Dialogue:CINNA=There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Am I not stay'd for? tell me.
Dialogue:CINNA=Yes, you are.
Dialogue:CINNA=O Cassius, if you could
Dialogue:CINNA=But win the noble Brutus to our party--
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
Dialogue:CASSIUS=In at his window; set this up with wax
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
Dialogue:CINNA=All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone
Dialogue:CINNA=To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
Dialogue:CINNA=And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.
Notice:Exit CINNA
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
Dialogue:CASSIUS=See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Is ours already, and the man entire
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
Dialogue:CASCA=O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
Dialogue:CASCA=And that which would appear offence in us,
Dialogue:CASCA=His countenance, like richest alchemy,
Dialogue:CASCA=Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Him and his worth and our great need of him
Dialogue:CASSIUS=You have right well conceited. Let us go,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=For it is after midnight; and ere day
Dialogue:CASSIUS=We will awake him and be sure of him.

Notice:Exit
Dialogue:BRUTUS=It must be by his death: and for my part,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=But for the general. He would be crown'd:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=How that might change his nature, there's the question.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That at his will he may do danger with.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I have not known when his affections sway'd
Dialogue:BRUTUS=More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=But when he once attains the upmost round.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=He then unto the ladder turns his back,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
Dialogue:BRUTUS=By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Would run to these and these extremities:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And kill him in the shell.

Dialogue:BRUTUS=Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
Dialogue:BRUTUS='Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated
Dialogue:BRUTUS=To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:

Dialogue:BRUTUS=And the first motion, all the interim is
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The Genius and the mortal instruments
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Are then in council; and the state of man,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The nature of an insurrection.

Dialogue:CASSIUS=Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I have been up this hour, awake all night.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Know I these men that come along with you?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Yes, every man of them, and no man here
Dialogue:CASSIUS=But honours you; and every one doth wish
Dialogue:CASSIUS=You had but that opinion of yourself
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Which every noble Roman bears of you.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=This is Trebonius.

Dialogue:CASSIUS=This, Decius Brutus.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=He is welcome too.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.

Dialogue:CASCA=Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Give me your hands all over, one by one.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And let us swear our resolution.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--
Dialogue:BRUTUS=If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And every man hence to his idle bed;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
Dialogue:BRUTUS=To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=What need we any spur but our own cause,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=To prick us to redress? what other bond
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And will not palter? and what other oath
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Than honesty to honesty engaged,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The even virtue of our enterprise,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=To think that or our cause or our performance
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Is guilty of a several bastardy,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=If he do break the smallest particle
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I think he will stand very strong with us.
Dialogue:CASCA=Let us not leave him out.
Dialogue:CINNA=No, by no means.
Dialogue:METELLUS CIMBER=O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
Dialogue:METELLUS CIMBER=Will purchase us a good opinion
Dialogue:METELLUS CIMBER=And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
Dialogue:METELLUS CIMBER=It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;
Dialogue:METELLUS CIMBER=Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
Dialogue:METELLUS CIMBER=But all be buried in his gravity.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=O, name him not: let us not break with him;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=For he will never follow any thing
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That other men begin.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Then leave him out.
Dialogue:CASCA=Indeed he is not fit.
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
Dialogue:CASSIUS=A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=If he improve them, may well stretch so far
Dialogue:CASSIUS=As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Our purpose necessary and not envious:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Which so appearing to the common eyes,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
Dialogue:BRUTUS=When Caesar's head is off.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Yet I fear him;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=If he love Caesar, all that he can do
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And that were much he should; for he is given
Dialogue:BRUTUS=To sports, to wildness and much company.
Dialogue:TREBONIUS=There is no fear in him; let him not die;
Dialogue:TREBONIUS=For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.
Notice:Clock strikes
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Peace! count the clock.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=The clock hath stricken three.
Dialogue:TREBONIUS='Tis time to part.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=                  But it is doubtful yet,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=For he is superstitious grown of late,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Quite from the main opinion he held once
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=It may be, these apparent prodigies,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And the persuasion of his augurers,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=May hold him from the Capitol to-day.
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=Lions with toils and men with flatterers;
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=He says he does, being then most flattered.
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=Let me work;
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=For I can give his humour the true bent,
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=And I will bring him to the Capitol.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
Dialogue:CINNA=Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
Dialogue:METELLUS CIMBER=Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
Dialogue:METELLUS CIMBER=Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:
Dialogue:METELLUS CIMBER=I wonder none of you have thought of him.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember
Dialogue:CASSIUS=What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Let not our looks put on our purposes,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=But bear it as our Roman actors do,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=With untired spirits and formal constancy:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And so good morrow to you every one.

Dialogue:BRUTUS=Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=It is not for your health thus to commit
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
Dialogue:PORTIA=Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
Dialogue:PORTIA=Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
Dialogue:PORTIA=You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
Dialogue:PORTIA=Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
Dialogue:PORTIA=And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
Dialogue:PORTIA=You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
Dialogue:PORTIA=I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
Dialogue:PORTIA=And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;
Dialogue:PORTIA=Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
Dialogue:PORTIA=But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
Dialogue:PORTIA=Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
Dialogue:PORTIA=Fearing to strengthen that impatience
Dialogue:PORTIA=Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
Dialogue:PORTIA=Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
Dialogue:PORTIA=Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
Dialogue:PORTIA=It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
Dialogue:PORTIA=And could it work so much upon your shape
Dialogue:PORTIA=As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
Dialogue:PORTIA=I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
Dialogue:PORTIA=Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I am not well in health, and that is all.
Dialogue:PORTIA=Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
Dialogue:PORTIA=He would embrace the means to come by it.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
Dialogue:PORTIA=Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
Dialogue:PORTIA=To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
Dialogue:PORTIA=Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
Dialogue:PORTIA=And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
Dialogue:PORTIA=To dare the vile contagion of the night
Dialogue:PORTIA=And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
Dialogue:PORTIA=To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
Dialogue:PORTIA=You have some sick offence within your mind,
Dialogue:PORTIA=Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
Dialogue:PORTIA=I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
Dialogue:PORTIA=I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
Dialogue:PORTIA=By all your vows of love and that great vow
Dialogue:PORTIA=Which did incorporate and make us one,
Dialogue:PORTIA=That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
Dialogue:PORTIA=Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
Dialogue:PORTIA=Have had to resort to you: for here have been
Dialogue:PORTIA=Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
Dialogue:PORTIA=Even from darkness.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Kneel not, gentle Portia.
Dialogue:PORTIA=I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
Dialogue:PORTIA=Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
Dialogue:PORTIA=Is it excepted I should know no secrets
Dialogue:PORTIA=That appertain to you? Am I yourself
Dialogue:PORTIA=But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
Dialogue:PORTIA=To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
Dialogue:PORTIA=And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
Dialogue:PORTIA=Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
Dialogue:PORTIA=Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=You are my true and honourable wife,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That visit my sad heart
Dialogue:PORTIA=If this were true, then should I know this secret.
Dialogue:PORTIA=I grant I am a woman; but withal
Dialogue:PORTIA=A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
Dialogue:PORTIA=I grant I am a woman; but withal
Dialogue:PORTIA=A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
Dialogue:PORTIA=Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
Dialogue:PORTIA=Being so father'd and so husbanded?
Dialogue:PORTIA=Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
Dialogue:PORTIA=I have made strong proof of my constancy,
Dialogue:PORTIA=Giving myself a voluntary wound
Dialogue:PORTIA=Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.
Dialogue:PORTIA=And not my husband's secrets?

Dialogue:LIGARIUS=Any exploit worthy the name of honour.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,

Dialogue:CALPURNIA=You shall not stir out of your house to-day.
Dialogue:CAESAR=Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
Dialogue:CAESAR=Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
Dialogue:CAESAR=The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
Dialogue:CALPURNIA=Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
Dialogue:CALPURNIA=Yet now they fright me. There is one within,

Dialogue:CALPURNIA=Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
Dialogue:CALPURNIA=A lioness hath whelped in the streets;

Dialogue:CALPURNIA=The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
Dialogue:CALPURNIA=Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
Dialogue:CALPURNIA=And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.

Dialogue:CAESAR=What can be avoided
Dialogue:CAESAR=Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
Dialogue:CAESAR=Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
Dialogue:CAESAR=Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
Dialogue:CALPURNIA=When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
Dialogue:CALPURNIA=The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
Dialogue:CAESAR=Cowards die many times before their deaths;
Dialogue:CAESAR=The valiant never taste of death but once.
Dialogue:CAESAR=Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
Dialogue:CAESAR=It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
Dialogue:CAESAR=Seeing that death, a necessary end,

Dialogue:Servant=They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
Dialogue:Servant=Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
Dialogue:Servant=They could not find a heart within the beast.
Dialogue:CAESAR=The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
Dialogue:CAESAR=Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
Dialogue:CAESAR=If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
Dialogue:CAESAR=No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well
Dialogue:CAESAR=That Caesar is more dangerous than he:

Dialogue:CAESAR=To bear my greeting to the senators
Dialogue:CAESAR=And tell them that I will not come to-day:
Dialogue:CAESAR=Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
Dialogue:CAESAR=I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.
Dialogue:CALPURNIA=Say he is sick.
Dialogue:CAESAR=                  Shall Caesar send a lie?
Dialogue:CAESAR=Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
Dialogue:CAESAR=To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
Dialogue:CAESAR=Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
Dialogue:CAESAR=The cause is in my will: I will not come;
Dialogue:CAESAR=That is enough to satisfy the senate.
Dialogue:CAESAR=But for your private satisfaction,
Dialogue:CAESAR=Because I love you, I will let you know:
Dialogue:CAESAR=Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
Dialogue:CAESAR=She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
Dialogue:CAESAR=Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
Dialogue:CAESAR=Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
Dialogue:CAESAR=Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
Dialogue:CAESAR=And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
Dialogue:CAESAR=And evils imminent; and on her knee
Dialogue:CAESAR=Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=This dream is all amiss interpreted;
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=It was a vision fair and fortunate:
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
Dialogue:CAESAR=And this way have you well expounded it.
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=I have, when you have heard what I can say:
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=And know it now: the senate have concluded
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=If you shall send them word you will not come,
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=Apt to be render'd, for some one to say
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS='Break up the senate till another time,
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS='Lo, Caesar is afraid'?
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
Dialogue:DECIUS BRUTUS=To our proceeding bids me tell you this;

Dialogue:BRUTUS=Have thus proceeded.
Dialogue:ANTONY=I doubt not of your wisdom.

Dialogue:ANTONY=Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;

Dialogue:ANTONY=Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
Dialogue:ANTONY=My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
Dialogue:ANTONY=That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,

Dialogue:ANTONY=Dost thou here lie!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Mark Antony,--
Dialogue:ANTONY=                  Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
Dialogue:ANTONY=The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
Dialogue:ANTONY=Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=But what compact mean you to have with us?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
Dialogue:ANTONY=Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Friends am I with you all and love you all,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
Dialogue:ANTONY=Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Or else were this a savage spectacle:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Our reasons are so full of good regard
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=You should be satisfied.
Dialogue:ANTONY=That's all I seek:
Dialogue:ANTONY=And am moreover suitor that I may
Dialogue:ANTONY=Produce his body to the market-place;
Dialogue:ANTONY=And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Speak in the order of his funeral.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=You shall, Mark Antony.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Brutus, a word with you.
Notice:Aside to BRUTUS
Dialogue:CASSIUS=You know not what you do: do not consent
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That Antony speak in his funeral:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Know you how much the people may be moved
Dialogue:CASSIUS=By that which he will utter?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=By your pardon;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I will myself into the pulpit first,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And show the reason of our Caesar's death:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=What Antony shall speak, I will protest
Dialogue:BRUTUS=He speaks by leave and by permission,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And that we are contented Caesar shall
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I know not what may fall; I like it not.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And say you do't by our permission;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Else shall you not have any hand at all
Dialogue:BRUTUS=About his funeral: and you shall speak
Dialogue:BRUTUS=In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=After my speech is ended.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Be it so.
Dialogue:ANTONY=I do desire no more.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Prepare the body then, and follow us.

Dialogue:ANTONY=O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
Dialogue:ANTONY=That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Dialogue:ANTONY=Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
Dialogue:ANTONY=That ever lived in the tide of times.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Dialogue:ANTONY=Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--
Dialogue:ANTONY=Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
Dialogue:ANTONY=To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--
Dialogue:ANTONY=A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
Dialogue:ANTONY=Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Dialogue:ANTONY=Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
Dialogue:ANTONY=Blood and destruction shall be so in use
Dialogue:ANTONY=And dreadful objects so familiar
Dialogue:ANTONY=That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Dialogue:ANTONY=Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
Dialogue:ANTONY=All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
Dialogue:ANTONY=And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
Dialogue:ANTONY=With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
Dialogue:ANTONY=Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
Dialogue:ANTONY=That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
Dialogue:ANTONY=With carrion men, groaning for burial.
Notice:Enter a Servant
Dialogue:ANTONY=You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
Dialogue:Servant=I do, Mark Antony.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
Dialogue:Servant=He did receive his letters, and is coming;
Dialogue:Servant=And bid me say to you by word of mouth--
Dialogue:Servant=O Caesar!--
Notice:Seeing the body
Dialogue:ANTONY=Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Began to water. Is thy master coming?
Dialogue:Servant=He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:
Dialogue:ANTONY=Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
Dialogue:ANTONY=No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
Dialogue:ANTONY=Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;
Dialogue:ANTONY=Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
Dialogue:ANTONY=Into the market-place: there shall I try
Dialogue:ANTONY=In my oration, how the people take
Dialogue:ANTONY=The cruel issue of these bloody men;
Dialogue:ANTONY=According to the which, thou shalt discourse
Dialogue:ANTONY=To young Octavius of the state of things.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Lend me your hand.
Notice:Exeunt with CAESAR's body
Banner:SCENE II. The Forum.
Notice:Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens
Dialogue:Citizens=We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Cassius, go you into the other street,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And part the numbers.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And public reasons shall be rendered
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Of Caesar's death.
Dialogue:First Citizen=                  I will hear Brutus speak.
Dialogue:Second Citizen=I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,
Dialogue:Second Citizen=When severally we hear them rendered.
Notice:Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS goes into the pulpit
Dialogue:Third Citizen=The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Be patient till the last.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
Dialogue:BRUTUS=cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
Dialogue:BRUTUS=for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
Dialogue:BRUTUS=you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
Dialogue:BRUTUS=awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
Dialogue:BRUTUS=was no less than his. If then that friend demand
Dialogue:BRUTUS=why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
Dialogue:BRUTUS=die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
Dialogue:BRUTUS=all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
Dialogue:BRUTUS=valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
Dialogue:BRUTUS=slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
Dialogue:BRUTUS=fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
Dialogue:BRUTUS=ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
Dialogue:BRUTUS=bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
Dialogue:BRUTUS=any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
Dialogue:BRUTUS=vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
Dialogue:All=None, Brutus, none.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
Dialogue:BRUTUS=his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
Dialogue:BRUTUS=extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
Dialogue:BRUTUS=enforced, for which he suffered death.
Notice:Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
Dialogue:BRUTUS=the benefit of his dying, a place in the
Dialogue:BRUTUS=commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the
Dialogue:BRUTUS=good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=when it shall please my country to need my death.
Dialogue:All=Live, Brutus! live, live!
Dialogue:First Citizen=Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
Dialogue:Second Citizen=Give him a statue with his ancestors.
Dialogue:Third Citizen=Let him be Caesar.
Dialogue:Fourth Citizen=                  Caesar's better parts
Dialogue:Fourth Citizen=Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
Dialogue:First Citizen=We'll bring him to his house
Dialogue:First Citizen=With shouts and clamours.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=My countrymen,--
Dialogue:Second Citizen=Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.
Dialogue:First Citizen=Peace, ho!
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=By our permission, is allow'd to make.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I do entreat you, not a man depart,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:First Citizen=Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.
Dialogue:Third Citizen=Let him go up into the public chair;
Dialogue:Third Citizen=We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.
Dialogue:ANTONY=For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
Notice:Goes into the pulpit
Dialogue:Fourth Citizen=What does he say of Brutus?
Dialogue:Third Citizen=He says, for Brutus' sake,
Dialogue:Third Citizen=He finds himself beholding to us all.
Dialogue:Fourth Citizen='Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
Dialogue:First Citizen=This Caesar was a tyrant.
Dialogue:Third Citizen=Nay, that's certain:
Dialogue:Third Citizen=We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
Dialogue:Second Citizen=Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.
Dialogue:ANTONY=You gentle Romans,--
Dialogue:Citizens=Peace, ho! let us hear him.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
Dialogue:ANTONY=I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
Dialogue:ANTONY=The evil that men do lives after them;
Dialogue:ANTONY=The good is oft interred with their bones;
Dialogue:ANTONY=So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Dialogue:ANTONY=Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
Dialogue:ANTONY=If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
Dialogue:ANTONY=And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
Dialogue:ANTONY=For Brutus is an honourable man;
Dialogue:ANTONY=So are they all, all honourable men--
Dialogue:ANTONY=Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
Dialogue:ANTONY=He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
Dialogue:ANTONY=But Brutus says he was ambitious;
Dialogue:ANTONY=And Brutus is an honourable man.
Dialogue:ANTONY=He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Dialogue:ANTONY=Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Dialogue:ANTONY=Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
Dialogue:ANTONY=When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
Dialogue:ANTONY=Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Dialogue:ANTONY=Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
Dialogue:ANTONY=And Brutus is an honourable man.
Dialogue:ANTONY=You all did see that on the Lupercal
Dialogue:ANTONY=I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
Dialogue:ANTONY=Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
Dialogue:ANTONY=And, sure, he is an honourable man.
Dialogue:ANTONY=I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
Dialogue:ANTONY=But here I am to speak what I do know.
Dialogue:ANTONY=You all did love him once, not without cause:
Dialogue:ANTONY=What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
Dialogue:ANTONY=O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
Dialogue:ANTONY=And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
Dialogue:ANTONY=My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
Dialogue:ANTONY=And I must pause till it come back to me.
Dialogue:First Citizen=Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
Dialogue:Second Citizen=If thou consider rightly of the matter,
Dialogue:Second Citizen=Caesar has had great wrong.
Dialogue:Third Citizen=Has he, masters?
Dialogue:Third Citizen=I fear there will a worse come in his place.
Dialogue:Fourth Citizen=Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
Dialogue:Fourth Citizen=Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
Dialogue:First Citizen=If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
Dialogue:Second Citizen=Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
Dialogue:Third Citizen=There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
Dialogue:Fourth Citizen=Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
Dialogue:ANTONY=But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Dialogue:ANTONY=Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
Dialogue:ANTONY=And none so poor to do him reverence.
Dialogue:ANTONY=O masters, if I were disposed to stir
Dialogue:ANTONY=Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
Dialogue:ANTONY=I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Who, you all know, are honourable men:
Dialogue:ANTONY=I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
Dialogue:ANTONY=To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Than I will wrong such honourable men.
Dialogue:ANTONY=But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
Dialogue:ANTONY=I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
Dialogue:ANTONY=Let but the commons hear this testament--
Dialogue:ANTONY=Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
Dialogue:ANTONY=And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
Dialogue:ANTONY=And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
Dialogue:ANTONY=And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
Dialogue:ANTONY=Unto their issue.
Dialogue:Fourth Citizen=We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.
Dialogue:All=The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
Dialogue:ANTONY=It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
Dialogue:ANTONY=You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
Dialogue:ANTONY=And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,
Dialogue:ANTONY=It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
Dialogue:ANTONY='Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
Dialogue:ANTONY=For, if you should, O, what would come of it!
Dialogue:Fourth Citizen=Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;
Dialogue:Fourth Citizen=You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
Dialogue:ANTONY=I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
Dialogue:ANTONY=I fear I wrong the honourable men
Dialogue:ANTONY=Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.
Dialogue:Fourth Citizen=They were traitors: honourable men!
Dialogue:All=The will! the testament!
Dialogue:Second Citizen=They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.
Dialogue:ANTONY=You will compel me, then, to read the will?
Dialogue:ANTONY=Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
Dialogue:ANTONY=And let me show you him that made the will.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
Dialogue:Several Citizens=Come down.
Dialogue:Second Citizen=Descend.
Dialogue:Third Citizen=You shall have leave.
Notice:ANTONY comes down
Dialogue:Fourth Citizen=A ring; stand round.
Dialogue:First Citizen=Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
Dialogue:Second Citizen=Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.
Dialogue:Several Citizens=Stand back; room; bear back.
Dialogue:ANTONY=If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
Dialogue:ANTONY=You all do know this mantle: I remember
Dialogue:ANTONY=The first time ever Caesar put it on;
Dialogue:ANTONY='Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
Dialogue:ANTONY=That day he overcame the Nervii:
Dialogue:ANTONY=Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
Dialogue:ANTONY=See what a rent the envious Casca made:
Dialogue:ANTONY=Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
Dialogue:ANTONY=And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
Dialogue:ANTONY=As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
Dialogue:ANTONY=If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
Dialogue:ANTONY=For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
Dialogue:ANTONY=Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
Dialogue:ANTONY=This was the most unkindest cut of all;
Dialogue:ANTONY=For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
Dialogue:ANTONY=And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
Dialogue:ANTONY=O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Dialogue:ANTONY=Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
Dialogue:ANTONY=O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
Dialogue:ANTONY=The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
Dialogue:ANTONY=Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
Dialogue:First Citizen=O piteous spectacle!
Dialogue:Second Citizen=O noble Caesar!
Dialogue:Third Citizen=O woful day!
Dialogue:Fourth Citizen=O traitors, villains!
Dialogue:First Citizen=O most bloody sight!
Dialogue:Second Citizen=We will be revenged.
Dialogue:All=Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
Dialogue:All=Let not a traitor live!
Dialogue:ANTONY=Stay, countrymen.
Dialogue:First Citizen=Peace there! hear the noble Antony.
Dialogue:Second Citizen=We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
Dialogue:ANTONY=To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
Dialogue:ANTONY=They that have done this deed are honourable:
Dialogue:ANTONY=What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
Dialogue:ANTONY=That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
Dialogue:ANTONY=And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
Dialogue:ANTONY=I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
Dialogue:ANTONY=I am no orator, as Brutus is;
Dialogue:ANTONY=But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
Dialogue:ANTONY=That love my friend; and that they know full well
Dialogue:ANTONY=That gave me public leave to speak of him:
Dialogue:ANTONY=For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Dialogue:ANTONY=Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
Dialogue:ANTONY=To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
Dialogue:ANTONY=I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Dialogue:ANTONY=Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
Dialogue:ANTONY=And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
Dialogue:ANTONY=And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Dialogue:ANTONY=Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
Dialogue:ANTONY=In every wound of Caesar that should move
Dialogue:ANTONY=The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
Dialogue:All=We'll mutiny.
Dialogue:First Citizen=We'll burn the house of Brutus.
Dialogue:Third Citizen=Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
Dialogue:All=Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!
Dialogue:ANTONY=Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:
Dialogue:ANTONY=Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
Dialogue:ANTONY=Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:
Dialogue:ANTONY=You have forgot the will I told you of.
Dialogue:All=Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
Dialogue:ANTONY=To every Roman citizen he gives,
Dialogue:ANTONY=To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
Dialogue:Second Citizen=Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
Dialogue:Third Citizen=O royal Caesar!
Dialogue:ANTONY=Hear me with patience.
Dialogue:All=Peace, ho!
Dialogue:ANTONY=Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
Dialogue:ANTONY=His private arbours and new-planted orchards,
Dialogue:ANTONY=On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
Dialogue:ANTONY=And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,
Dialogue:ANTONY=To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?
Dialogue:First Citizen=Never, never. Come, away, away!
Dialogue:First Citizen=We'll burn his body in the holy place,
Dialogue:First Citizen=And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
Dialogue:First Citizen=Take up the body.
Dialogue:Second Citizen=Go fetch fire.
Dialogue:Third Citizen=Pluck down benches.

Dialogue:ANTONY=He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
Dialogue:ANTONY=And in this mood will give us any thing.
Dialogue:Servant=I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius
Dialogue:Servant=Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.

Dialogue:CINNA THE POET=truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.

Dialogue:ANTONY=Octavius, I have seen more days than you:
Dialogue:ANTONY=And though we lay these honours on this man,

Dialogue:ANTONY=He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
Dialogue:ANTONY=To groan and sweat under the business,

Dialogue:ANTONY=And having brought our treasure where we will,

Dialogue:BRUTUS=What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?
Dialogue:LUCILIUS=He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
Dialogue:LUCILIUS=To do you salutation from his master.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=In his own change, or by ill officers,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I shall be satisfied.
Dialogue:PINDARUS=I do not doubt
Dialogue:PINDARUS=But that my noble master will appear
Dialogue:PINDARUS=Such as he is, full of regard and honour.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=How he received you, let me be resolved.
Dialogue:LUCILIUS=With courtesy and with respect enough;
Dialogue:LUCILIUS=But not with such familiar instances,
Dialogue:LUCILIUS=Nor with such free and friendly conference,
Dialogue:LUCILIUS=As he hath used of old.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Thou hast described
Dialogue:BRUTUS=A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=When love begins to sicken and decay,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=It useth an enforced ceremony.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=But when they should endure the bloody spur,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
Dialogue:LUCILIUS=They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;

Dialogue:CASSIUS=Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And when you do them--
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Cassius, be content.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Before the eyes of both our armies here,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And I will give you audience.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Pindarus,

Banner:SCENE III. Brutus's tent.
Notice:Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
Dialogue:CASSIUS=For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=In such a time as this it is not meet
Dialogue:CASSIUS=That every nice offence should bear his comment.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=To sell and mart your offices for gold
Dialogue:BRUTUS=To undeservers.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=                  I an itching palm!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Chastisement!
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Remember March, the ides of March remember:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And not for justice? What, shall one of us
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That struck the foremost man of all this world
Dialogue:BRUTUS=But for supporting robbers, shall we now
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And sell the mighty space of our large honours
Dialogue:BRUTUS=For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Than such a Roman.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=                  Brutus, bay not me;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Older in practise, abler than yourself
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To make conditions.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Go to; you are not, Cassius.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I am.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I say you are not.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Away, slight man!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Is't possible?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=                  Hear me, for I will speak.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Under your testy humour? By the gods
Dialogue:BRUTUS=You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=When you are waspish.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Is it come to this?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=You say you are a better soldier:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Did I say 'better'?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=If you did, I care not.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I durst not!
Dialogue:BRUTUS=No.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=What, durst not tempt him!
Dialogue:BRUTUS=For your life you durst not!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Do not presume too much upon my love;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I may do that I shall be sorry for.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=You have done that you should be sorry for.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That they pass by me as the idle wind,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Which I respect not. I did send to you
Dialogue:BRUTUS=For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=For I can raise no money by vile means:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
Dialogue:BRUTUS=From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
Dialogue:BRUTUS=By any indirection: I did send
Dialogue:BRUTUS=To you for gold to pay my legions,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Dash him to pieces!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I denied you not.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=You did.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I did not: he was but a fool that brought
Dialogue:CASSIUS=My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I do not, till you practise them on me.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=You love me not.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=                  I do not like your faults.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=A friendly eye could never see such faults.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
Dialogue:BRUTUS=As huge as high Olympus.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=For Cassius is aweary of the world;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
Dialogue:CASSIUS=My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And here my naked breast; within, a heart
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Sheathe your dagger:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That carries anger as the flint bears fire;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And straight is cold again.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Hath Cassius lived
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And my heart too.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=                  O Brutus!
Dialogue:BRUTUS=What's the matter?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Have not you love enough to bear with me,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=When that rash humour which my mother gave me
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Makes me forgetful?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
Dialogue:Poet=[Within]  Let me go in to see the generals;
Dialogue:Poet=There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
Dialogue:Poet=They be alone.
Dialogue:LUCILIUS=[Within]  You shall not come to them.
Dialogue:Poet=[Within]  Nothing but death shall stay me.
Notice:Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS
Dialogue:CASSIUS=How now! what's the matter?
Dialogue:Poet=For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
Dialogue:Poet=Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
Dialogue:Poet=For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Companion, hence!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=                  Away, away, be gone.
Notice:Exit Poet
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Immediately to us.
Notice:Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Lucius, a bowl of wine!
Notice:Exit LUCIUS
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I did not think you could have been so angry.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Of your philosophy you make no use,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=If you give place to accidental evils.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Ha! Portia!
Dialogue:BRUTUS=She is dead.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=O insupportable and touching loss!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Upon what sickness?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Impatient of my absence,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And died so?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=                  Even so.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=O ye immortal gods!
Notice:Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taper
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Come in, Titinius!
Notice:Exit LUCIUS
Notice:Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Welcome, good Messala.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Now sit we close about this taper here,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And call in question our necessities.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Portia, art thou gone?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=No more, I pray you.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Messala, I have here received letters,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That young Octavius and Mark Antony
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Come down upon us with a mighty power,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
Dialogue:MESSALA=Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=With what addition?
Dialogue:MESSALA=That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
Dialogue:MESSALA=Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,
Dialogue:MESSALA=Have put to death an hundred senators.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Therein our letters do not well agree;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Mine speak of seventy senators that died
Dialogue:BRUTUS=By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Cicero one!
Dialogue:MESSALA=          Cicero is dead,
Dialogue:MESSALA=And by that order of proscription.
Dialogue:MESSALA=Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=No, Messala.
Dialogue:MESSALA=Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Nothing, Messala.
Dialogue:MESSALA=                  That, methinks, is strange.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
Dialogue:MESSALA=No, my lord.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
Dialogue:MESSALA=Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
Dialogue:MESSALA=For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=With meditating that she must die once,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I have the patience to endure it now.
Dialogue:MESSALA=Even so great men great losses should endure.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I have as much of this in art as you,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=But yet my nature could not bear it so.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Well, to our work alive. What do you think
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Of marching to Philippi presently?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=I do not think it good.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Your reason?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=This it is:
Dialogue:CASSIUS='Tis better that the enemy seek us:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Do stand but in a forced affection;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=For they have grudged us contribution:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The enemy, marching along by them,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=By them shall make a fuller number up,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=From which advantage shall we cut him off,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=If at Philippi we do face him there,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=These people at our back.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Hear me, good brother.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Under your pardon. You must note beside,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The enemy increaseth every day;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=We, at the height, are ready to decline.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=There is a tide in the affairs of men,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=On such a full sea are we now afloat;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And we must take the current when it serves,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Or lose our ventures.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Then, with your will, go on;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And nature must obey necessity;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Which we will niggard with a little rest.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=There is no more to say?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=No more. Good night:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.

Dialogue:BRUTUS=Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Good night, and good repose.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=O my dear brother!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=This was an ill beginning of the night:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Never come such division 'tween our souls!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Let it not, Brutus.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Every thing is well.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Good night, my lord.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Good night, good brother.

Dialogue:BRUTUS=Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.

Dialogue:BRUTUS=I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
Dialogue:LUCIUS=Varro and Claudius!

Dialogue:VARRO=So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;

Dialogue:LUCIUS=Ay, my lord, an't please you.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=It does, my boy:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
Dialogue:LUCIUS=It is my duty, sir.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
Dialogue:LUCIUS=I have slept, my lord, already.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I will be good to thee.
Notice:Music, and a song
Dialogue:BRUTUS=This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.

Dialogue:BRUTUS=Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Speak to me what thou art.
Dialogue:GHOST=Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Why comest thou?

Dialogue:OCTAVIUS=It proves not so: their battles are at hand;
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS=They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS=Answering before we do demand of them.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
Dialogue:ANTONY=Wherefore they do it: they could be content
Dialogue:ANTONY=To visit other places; and come down
Dialogue:ANTONY=With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
Dialogue:ANTONY=To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;

Dialogue:OCTAVIUS=Not that we love words better, as you do.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.

Dialogue:ANTONY=Not stingless too.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=O, yes, and soundless too;

Dialogue:BRUTUS=And very wisely threat before you sting.
Dialogue:ANTONY=Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers

Dialogue:OCTAVIUS=Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS=Be well avenged; or till another Caesar
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS=Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS=So I hope;
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS=I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Join'd with a masker and a reveller!
Dialogue:ANTONY=Old Cassius still!
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS=                  Come, Antony, away!
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS=Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS=If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;
Dialogue:OCTAVIUS=If not, when you have stomachs.

Dialogue:LUCILIUS=[Standing forth]	My lord?
Notice:BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Messala!
Dialogue:MESSALA=[Standing forth]  What says my general?
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Messala,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=This is my birth-day; as this very day
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Be thou my witness that against my will,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Upon one battle all our liberties.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=You know that I held Epicurus strong
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And his opinion: now I change my mind,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And partly credit things that do presage.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Who to Philippi here consorted us:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=This morning are they fled away and gone;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
Dialogue:CASSIUS=A canopy most fatal, under which
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
Dialogue:MESSALA=Believe not so.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=                  I but believe it partly;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
Dialogue:CASSIUS=To meet all perils very constantly.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Even so, Lucilius.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=                  Now, most noble Brutus,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=If we do lose this battle, then is this
Dialogue:CASSIUS=The very last time we shall speak together:
Dialogue:CASSIUS=What are you then determined to do?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Even by the rule of that philosophy
Dialogue:BRUTUS=By which I did blame Cato for the death
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Which he did give himself, I know not how,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=But I do find it cowardly and vile,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The time of life: arming myself with patience
Dialogue:BRUTUS=To stay the providence of some high powers
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That govern us below.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Then, if we lose this battle,
Dialogue:CASSIUS=You are contented to be led in triumph
Dialogue:CASSIUS=Thorough the streets of Rome?
Dialogue:BRUTUS=No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=He bears too great a mind. But this same day
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Must end that work the ides of March begun;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And whether we shall meet again I know not.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
Dialogue:BRUTUS=For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
Dialogue:BRUTUS=If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
Dialogue:BRUTUS=If not, why then, this parting was well made.
Dialogue:CASSIUS=For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
Dialogue:CASSIUS=If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
Dialogue:CASSIUS=If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
Dialogue:BRUTUS=Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
Dialogue:BRUTUS=The end of this day's business ere it come!
Dialogue:BRUTUS=But it sufficeth that the day will end,
Dialogue:BRUTUS=And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!

Dialogue:TITINIUS=O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;
