Banner:SCENE I. The king of Navarre's park.
Notice:Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
Dialogue:FERDINAND=When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=The endeavor of this present breath may buy
Dialogue:FERDINAND=That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And make us heirs of all eternity.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=That war against your own affections
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And the huge army of the world's desires,--
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Our court shall be a little Academe,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Still and contemplative in living art.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
Dialogue:FERDINAND=My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
Dialogue:FERDINAND=That are recorded in this schedule here:
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=That his own hand may strike his honour down
Dialogue:FERDINAND=That violates the smallest branch herein:
Dialogue:FERDINAND=If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.
Dialogue:DUMAIN=My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
Dialogue:DUMAIN=The grosser manner of these world's delights
Dialogue:DUMAIN=He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
Dialogue:DUMAIN=To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
Dialogue:DUMAIN=With all these living in philosophy.
Dialogue:BIRON=I can but say their protestation over;
Dialogue:BIRON=So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
Dialogue:BIRON=That is, to live and study here three years.
Dialogue:BIRON=But there are other strict observances;
Dialogue:BIRON=As, not to see a woman in that term,
Dialogue:BIRON=Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
Dialogue:BIRON=And one day in a week to touch no food
Dialogue:BIRON=And but one meal on every day beside,
Dialogue:BIRON=The which I hope is not enrolled there;
Dialogue:BIRON=And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
Dialogue:BIRON=And not be seen to wink of all the day--
Dialogue:BIRON=When I was wont to think no harm all night
Dialogue:BIRON=And make a dark night too of half the day--
Dialogue:BIRON=Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
Dialogue:BIRON=O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
Dialogue:BIRON=Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
Dialogue:BIRON=Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
Dialogue:BIRON=I only swore to study with your grace
Dialogue:BIRON=And stay here in your court for three years' space.
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.
Dialogue:BIRON=By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
Dialogue:BIRON=What is the end of study? let me know.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Why, that to know, which else we should not know.
Dialogue:BIRON=Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.
Dialogue:BIRON=Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
Dialogue:BIRON=To know the thing I am forbid to know:
Dialogue:BIRON=As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
Dialogue:BIRON=When I to feast expressly am forbid;
Dialogue:BIRON=Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
Dialogue:BIRON=When mistresses from common sense are hid;
Dialogue:BIRON=Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
Dialogue:BIRON=Study to break it and not break my troth.
Dialogue:BIRON=If study's gain be thus and this be so,
Dialogue:BIRON=Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
Dialogue:BIRON=Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=These be the stops that hinder study quite
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And train our intellects to vain delight.
Dialogue:BIRON=Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
Dialogue:BIRON=Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
Dialogue:BIRON=As, painfully to pore upon a book
Dialogue:BIRON=To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
Dialogue:BIRON=Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
Dialogue:BIRON=Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
Dialogue:BIRON=So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
Dialogue:BIRON=Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
Dialogue:BIRON=Study me how to please the eye indeed
Dialogue:BIRON=By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
Dialogue:BIRON=Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
Dialogue:BIRON=And give him light that it was blinded by.
Dialogue:BIRON=Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
Dialogue:BIRON=That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
Dialogue:BIRON=Small have continual plodders ever won
Dialogue:BIRON=Save base authority from others' books
Dialogue:BIRON=These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
Dialogue:BIRON=That give a name to every fixed star
Dialogue:BIRON=Have no more profit of their shining nights
Dialogue:BIRON=Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
Dialogue:BIRON=Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
Dialogue:BIRON=And every godfather can give a name.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=How well he's read, to reason against reading!
Dialogue:DUMAIN=Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.
Dialogue:BIRON=The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.
Dialogue:DUMAIN=How follows that?
Dialogue:BIRON=                  Fit in his place and time.
Dialogue:DUMAIN=In reason nothing.
Dialogue:BIRON=                  Something then in rhyme.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=That bites the first-born infants of the spring.
Dialogue:BIRON=Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
Dialogue:BIRON=Before the birds have any cause to sing?
Dialogue:BIRON=Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
Dialogue:BIRON=At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Dialogue:BIRON=Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
Dialogue:BIRON=But like of each thing that in season grows.
Dialogue:BIRON=So you, to study now it is too late,
Dialogue:BIRON=Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.
Dialogue:BIRON=No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
Dialogue:BIRON=And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Dialogue:BIRON=Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
Dialogue:BIRON=Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
Dialogue:BIRON=And bide the penance of each three years' day.
Dialogue:BIRON=Give me the paper; let me read the same;
Dialogue:BIRON=And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
Dialogue:BIRON=[Reads]  'Item, That no woman shall come within a
Dialogue:BIRON=mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=Four days ago.
Dialogue:BIRON=Let's see the penalty.
Notice:Reads
Dialogue:BIRON='On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=Marry, that did I.
Dialogue:BIRON=Sweet lord, and why?
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
Dialogue:BIRON=A dangerous law against gentility!
Notice:Reads
Dialogue:BIRON='Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
Dialogue:BIRON=within the term of three years, he shall endure such
Dialogue:BIRON=public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
Dialogue:BIRON=This article, my liege, yourself must break;
Dialogue:BIRON=For well you know here comes in embassy
Dialogue:BIRON=The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
Dialogue:BIRON=A maid of grace and complete majesty--
Dialogue:BIRON=About surrender up of Aquitaine
Dialogue:BIRON=To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
Dialogue:BIRON=Therefore this article is made in vain,
Dialogue:BIRON=Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
Dialogue:BIRON=So study evermore is overshot:
Dialogue:BIRON=While it doth study to have what it would
Dialogue:BIRON=It doth forget to do the thing it should,
Dialogue:BIRON=And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
Dialogue:BIRON='Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=We must of force dispense with this decree;
Dialogue:FERDINAND=She must lie here on mere necessity.
Dialogue:BIRON=Necessity will make us all forsworn
Dialogue:BIRON=Three thousand times within this three years' space;
Dialogue:BIRON=For every man with his affects is born,
Dialogue:BIRON=Not by might master'd but by special grace:
Dialogue:BIRON=If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
Dialogue:BIRON=I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
Dialogue:BIRON=So to the laws at large I write my name:
Notice:Subscribes
Dialogue:BIRON=And he that breaks them in the least degree
Dialogue:BIRON=Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
Dialogue:BIRON=Suggestions are to other as to me;
Dialogue:BIRON=But I believe, although I seem so loath,
Dialogue:BIRON=I am the last that will last keep his oath.
Dialogue:BIRON=But is there no quick recreation granted?
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
Dialogue:FERDINAND=With a refined traveller of Spain;
Dialogue:FERDINAND=A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
Dialogue:FERDINAND=One whom the music of his own vain tongue
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
Dialogue:FERDINAND=A man of complements, whom right and wrong
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
Dialogue:FERDINAND=This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=For interim to our studies shall relate
Dialogue:FERDINAND=In high-born words the worth of many a knight
Dialogue:FERDINAND=From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
Dialogue:FERDINAND=But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And I will use him for my minstrelsy.
Dialogue:BIRON=Armado is a most illustrious wight,
Dialogue:BIRON=A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=And so to study, three years is but short.
Notice:Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD
Dialogue:DULL=Which is the duke's own person?
Dialogue:BIRON=This, fellow: what wouldst?
Dialogue:DULL=I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
Dialogue:DULL=grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
Dialogue:DULL=in flesh and blood.
Dialogue:BIRON=This is he.
Dialogue:DULL=Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
Dialogue:DULL=abroad: this letter will tell you more.
Dialogue:COSTARD=Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=A letter from the magnificent Armado.
Dialogue:BIRON=How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!
Dialogue:BIRON=To hear? or forbear laughing?
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=forbear both.
Dialogue:BIRON=Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
Dialogue:BIRON=climb in the merriness.
Dialogue:COSTARD=The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
Dialogue:COSTARD=The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.
Dialogue:BIRON=In what manner?
Dialogue:COSTARD=In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
Dialogue:COSTARD=I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
Dialogue:COSTARD=her upon the form, and taken following her into the
Dialogue:COSTARD=park; which, put together, is in manner and form
Dialogue:COSTARD=following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
Dialogue:COSTARD=manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
Dialogue:COSTARD=in some form.
Dialogue:BIRON=For the following, sir?
Dialogue:COSTARD=As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
Dialogue:COSTARD=the right!
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Will you hear this letter with attention?
Dialogue:BIRON=As we would hear an oracle.
Dialogue:COSTARD=Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=[Reads]  'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and
Dialogue:FERDINAND=sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=and body's fostering patron.'
Dialogue:COSTARD=Not a word of Costard yet.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=[Reads]  'So it is,'--
Dialogue:COSTARD=It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
Dialogue:COSTARD=telling true, but so.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Peace!
Dialogue:COSTARD=Be to me and every man that dares not fight!
Dialogue:FERDINAND=No words!
Dialogue:COSTARD=Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=[Reads]  'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured
Dialogue:FERDINAND=melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour
Dialogue:FERDINAND=to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
Dialogue:FERDINAND=air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to
Dialogue:FERDINAND=walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when
Dialogue:FERDINAND=beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down
Dialogue:FERDINAND=to that nourishment which is called supper: so much
Dialogue:FERDINAND=for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then
Dialogue:FERDINAND=for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter
Dialogue:FERDINAND=that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth
Dialogue:FERDINAND=from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which
Dialogue:FERDINAND=here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;
Dialogue:FERDINAND=but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east
Dialogue:FERDINAND=and by east from the west corner of thy curious-
Dialogue:FERDINAND=knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited
Dialogue:FERDINAND=swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'--
Dialogue:COSTARD=Me?
Dialogue:FERDINAND=[Reads]  'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--
Dialogue:COSTARD=Me?
Dialogue:FERDINAND=[Reads]  'that shallow vassal,'--
Dialogue:COSTARD=Still me?
Dialogue:FERDINAND=[Reads]  'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--
Dialogue:COSTARD=O, me!
Dialogue:FERDINAND=[Reads]  'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy
Dialogue:FERDINAND=established proclaimed edict and continent canon,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say
Dialogue:FERDINAND=wherewith,--
Dialogue:COSTARD=With a wench.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=[Reads]  'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a
Dialogue:FERDINAND=female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a
Dialogue:FERDINAND=woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
Dialogue:FERDINAND=punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and
Dialogue:FERDINAND=estimation.'
Dialogue:DULL='Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=[Reads]  'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel
Dialogue:FERDINAND=called which I apprehended with the aforesaid
Dialogue:FERDINAND=swain,--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;
Dialogue:FERDINAND=and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring
Dialogue:FERDINAND=her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted
Dialogue:FERDINAND=and heart-burning heat of duty.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
Dialogue:BIRON=This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
Dialogue:BIRON=that ever I heard.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say
Dialogue:FERDINAND=you to this?
Dialogue:COSTARD=Sir, I confess the wench.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Did you hear the proclamation?
Dialogue:COSTARD=I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
Dialogue:COSTARD=the marking of it.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
Dialogue:FERDINAND=with a wench.
Dialogue:COSTARD=I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'
Dialogue:COSTARD=This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'
Dialogue:COSTARD=If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
Dialogue:COSTARD=This maid will serve my turn, sir.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
Dialogue:FERDINAND=a week with bran and water.
Dialogue:COSTARD=I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And go we, lords, to put in practise that
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
Notice:Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN
Dialogue:BIRON=I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
Dialogue:BIRON=These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
Dialogue:BIRON=Sirrah, come on.
Dialogue:COSTARD=I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was
Dialogue:COSTARD=taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
Dialogue:COSTARD=girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
Dialogue:COSTARD=prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
Dialogue:COSTARD=till then, sit thee down, sorrow!
Notice:Exeunt
Dialogue:COSTARD=LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
Banner:SCENE II. The same.
Notice:Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH
Dialogue:COSTARD=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=grows melancholy?
Dialogue:MOTH=A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
Dialogue:MOTH=No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=tender juvenal?
Dialogue:MOTH=By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Why tough senior? why tough senior?
Dialogue:MOTH=Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=appertaining to thy young days, which we may
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=nominate tender.
Dialogue:MOTH=And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
Dialogue:MOTH=old time, which we may name tough.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON ADRIANO DE
Dialogue:ARMADO=Pretty and apt.
Dialogue:MOTH=How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
Dialogue:MOTH=I apt, and my saying pretty?
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Thou pretty, because little.
Dialogue:MOTH=Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=And therefore apt, because quick.
Dialogue:MOTH=Speak you this in my praise, master?
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=In thy condign praise.
Dialogue:MOTH=I will praise an eel with the same praise.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=What, that an eel is ingenious?
Dialogue:MOTH=That an eel is quick.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.
Dialogue:MOTH=I am answered, sir.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I love not to be crossed.
Dialogue:MOTH=[Aside]  He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I have promised to study three years with the duke.
Dialogue:MOTH=You may do it in an hour, sir.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Impossible.
Dialogue:MOTH=How many is one thrice told?
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
Dialogue:MOTH=You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=complete man.
Dialogue:MOTH=Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of
Dialogue:MOTH=deuce-ace amounts to.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=It doth amount to one more than two.
Dialogue:MOTH=Which the base vulgar do call three.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=True.
Dialogue:MOTH=Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here
Dialogue:MOTH=is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
Dialogue:MOTH=easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and
Dialogue:MOTH=study three years in two words, the dancing horse
Dialogue:MOTH=will tell you.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=A most fine figure!
Dialogue:MOTH=To prove you a cipher.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=have been in love?
Dialogue:MOTH=Hercules, master.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=repute and carriage.
Dialogue:MOTH=Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
Dialogue:MOTH=carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
Dialogue:MOTH=like a porter: and he was in love.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=love, my dear Moth?
Dialogue:MOTH=A woman, master.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Of what complexion?
Dialogue:MOTH=Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Tell me precisely of what complexion.
Dialogue:MOTH=Of the sea-water green, sir.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Is that one of the four complexions?
Dialogue:MOTH=As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
Dialogue:MOTH=It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=My love is most immaculate white and red.
Dialogue:MOTH=Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
Dialogue:MOTH=such colours.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Define, define, well-educated infant.
Dialogue:MOTH=My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=pathetical!
Dialogue:MOTH=     If she be made of white and red,
Dialogue:MOTH=Her faults will ne'er be known,
Dialogue:MOTH=For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
Dialogue:MOTH=And fears by pale white shown:
Dialogue:MOTH=Then if she fear, or be to blame,
Dialogue:MOTH=By this you shall not know,
Dialogue:MOTH=For still her cheeks possess the same
Dialogue:MOTH=Which native she doth owe.
Dialogue:MOTH=A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
Dialogue:MOTH=white and red.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
Dialogue:MOTH=The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
Dialogue:MOTH=three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be
Dialogue:MOTH=found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for
Dialogue:MOTH=the writing nor the tune.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=example my digression by some mighty precedent.
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.
Dialogue:MOTH=[Aside]  To be whipped; and yet a better love than
Dialogue:MOTH=my master.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
Dialogue:MOTH=And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I say, sing.
Dialogue:MOTH=Forbear till this company be past.
Notice:Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTA
Dialogue:DULL=Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard
Dialogue:DULL=safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
Dialogue:DULL=nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.
Dialogue:DULL=For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
Dialogue:DULL=is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.
Dialogue:DULL=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
Dialogue:JAQUENETTA=Man?
Dialogue:JAQUENETTA=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I will visit thee at the lodge.
Dialogue:JAQUENETTA=That's hereby.
Dialogue:JAQUENETTA=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I know where it is situate.
Dialogue:JAQUENETTA=Lord, how wise you are!
Dialogue:JAQUENETTA=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I will tell thee wonders.
Dialogue:JAQUENETTA=With that face?
Dialogue:JAQUENETTA=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I love thee.
Dialogue:JAQUENETTA=So I heard you say.
Dialogue:JAQUENETTA=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=And so, farewell.
Dialogue:JAQUENETTA=Fair weather after you!
Dialogue:DULL=Come, Jaquenetta, away!
Notice:Exeunt DULL and JAQUENETTA
Dialogue:DULL=DON

Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=how can that be true love which is falsely
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.

Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=the passado he respects not, the duello he regards

Dialogue:BOYET=Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
Dialogue:BOYET=To parley with the sole inheritor
Dialogue:BOYET=Of all perfections that a man may owe,
Dialogue:BOYET=Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight

Dialogue:BOYET=Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
Dialogue:BOYET=As Nature was in making graces dear

Dialogue:PRINCESS=Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
Dialogue:PRINCESS=I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Than you much willing to be counted wise

Dialogue:PRINCESS=Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Till painful study shall outwear three years,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=No woman may approach his silent court:
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Before we enter his forbidden gates,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Bold of your worthiness, we single you
Dialogue:PRINCESS=As our best-moving fair solicitor.

Dialogue:MARIA=I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,
Dialogue:MARIA=Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
Dialogue:MARIA=Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
Dialogue:MARIA=In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:
Dialogue:MARIA=A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
Dialogue:MARIA=Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:
Dialogue:MARIA=Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
Dialogue:MARIA=The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
Dialogue:MARIA=If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
Dialogue:MARIA=Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;
Dialogue:MARIA=Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
Dialogue:MARIA=It should none spare that come within his power.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?
Dialogue:MARIA=They say so most that most his humours know.

Dialogue:PRINCESS=Who are the rest?
Dialogue:KATHARINE=The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
Dialogue:KATHARINE=For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
Dialogue:KATHARINE=And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
Dialogue:KATHARINE=I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
Dialogue:KATHARINE=And much too little of that good I saw
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Is my report to his great worthiness.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Another of these students at that time
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Biron they call him; but a merrier man,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Within the limit of becoming mirth,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=I never spent an hour's talk withal:
Dialogue:ROSALINE=His eye begets occasion for his wit;
Dialogue:ROSALINE=For every object that the one doth catch
Dialogue:ROSALINE=The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Delivers in such apt and gracious words
Dialogue:ROSALINE=That aged ears play truant at his tales
Dialogue:ROSALINE=And younger hearings are quite ravished;
Dialogue:ROSALINE=So sweet and voluble is his discourse.

Dialogue:BOYET=Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
Dialogue:BOYET=And he and his competitors in oath
Dialogue:BOYET=Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
Dialogue:BOYET=Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
Dialogue:BOYET=He rather means to lodge you in the field,
Dialogue:BOYET=Like one that comes here to besiege his court,

Dialogue:BOYET=To let you enter his unpeopled house.
Dialogue:BOYET=Here comes Navarre.

Dialogue:FERDINAND=Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.
Dialogue:PRINCESS='Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have

Dialogue:PRINCESS=yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.

Dialogue:PRINCESS=I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=And sin to break it.

Dialogue:PRINCESS=To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=And suddenly resolve me in my suit.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=You will the sooner, that I were away;

Dialogue:BIRON=Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

Dialogue:FERDINAND=The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;

Dialogue:FERDINAND=Disbursed by my father in his wars.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=But say that he or we, as neither have,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
Dialogue:FERDINAND=A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,

Dialogue:FERDINAND=But that one half which is unsatisfied,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=For here he doth demand to have repaid
Dialogue:FERDINAND=A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=To have his title live in Aquitaine;
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Which we much rather had depart withal
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And have the money by our father lent
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
Dialogue:FERDINAND=From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
Dialogue:FERDINAND=A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And go well satisfied to France again.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=You do the king my father too much wrong
Dialogue:PRINCESS=And wrong the reputation of your name,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=In so unseeming to confess receipt
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=I do protest I never heard of it;
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Or yield up Aquitaine.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=We arrest your word.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Boyet, you can produce acquittances
Dialogue:PRINCESS=For such a sum from special officers

Dialogue:FERDINAND=It shall suffice me: at which interview
Dialogue:FERDINAND=All liberal reason I will yield unto.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
Dialogue:FERDINAND=As honour without breach of honour may
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
Dialogue:FERDINAND=You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
Dialogue:FERDINAND=But here without you shall be so received
Dialogue:FERDINAND=As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:

Dialogue:BOYET=Belonging to whom?
Dialogue:MARIA=                  To my fortunes and me.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:

Dialogue:PRINCESS=On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.

Dialogue:BOYET=Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=With what?
Dialogue:BOYET=With that which we lovers entitle affected.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Your reason?
Dialogue:BOYET=Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
Dialogue:BOYET=To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:
Dialogue:BOYET=His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
Dialogue:BOYET=Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
Dialogue:BOYET=His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
Dialogue:BOYET=Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
Dialogue:BOYET=All senses to that sense did make their repair,
Dialogue:BOYET=To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
Dialogue:BOYET=Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
Dialogue:BOYET=As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
Dialogue:BOYET=Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
Dialogue:BOYET=Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:

Dialogue:BOYET=That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.

Dialogue:BOYET=An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.
Dialogue:BOYET=But to speak that in words which his eye hath
Dialogue:BOYET=disclosed.
Dialogue:BOYET=I only have made a mouth of his eye,
Dialogue:BOYET=By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.

Dialogue:BIRON=Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:
Dialogue:BIRON=To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
Dialogue:BIRON=She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
Dialogue:BIRON=A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,

Dialogue:FERDINAND=O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.
Dialogue:BIRON=   Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
Dialogue:BIRON=O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,
Dialogue:BIRON=It mourns that painting and usurping hair
Dialogue:BIRON=Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
Dialogue:BIRON=And therefore is she born to make black fair.
Dialogue:BIRON=Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
Dialogue:BIRON=For native blood is counted painting now;
Dialogue:BIRON=And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,

Dialogue:BIRON=Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!
Dialogue:DUMAIN=O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies

Dialogue:DUMAIN=Some salve for perjury.
Dialogue:BIRON='Tis more than need.
Dialogue:BIRON=Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
Dialogue:BIRON=Consider what you first did swear unto,
Dialogue:BIRON=To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
Dialogue:BIRON=Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
Dialogue:BIRON=Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
Dialogue:BIRON=And abstinence engenders maladies.
Dialogue:BIRON=And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
Dialogue:BIRON=In that each of you have forsworn his book,
Dialogue:BIRON=Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
Dialogue:BIRON=For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
Dialogue:BIRON=Have found the ground of study's excellence
Dialogue:BIRON=Without the beauty of a woman's face?
Notice:From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;  They are the ground, the books, the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire
Dialogue:BIRON=Why, universal plodding poisons up
Dialogue:BIRON=The nimble spirits in the arteries,
Dialogue:BIRON=As motion and long-during action tires
Dialogue:BIRON=The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
Dialogue:BIRON=Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
Dialogue:BIRON=You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
Dialogue:BIRON=And study too, the causer of your vow;
Dialogue:BIRON=For where is any author in the world
Dialogue:BIRON=Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
Dialogue:BIRON=Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
Dialogue:BIRON=And where we are our learning likewise is:
Dialogue:BIRON=Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
Dialogue:BIRON=Do we not likewise see our learning there?
Dialogue:BIRON=O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
Dialogue:BIRON=And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
Dialogue:BIRON=For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
Dialogue:BIRON=In leaden contemplation have found out
Dialogue:BIRON=Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
Dialogue:BIRON=Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
Dialogue:BIRON=Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
Dialogue:BIRON=And therefore, finding barren practisers,
Dialogue:BIRON=Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
Dialogue:BIRON=But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
Dialogue:BIRON=Lives not alone immured in the brain;
Dialogue:BIRON=But, with the motion of all elements,
Dialogue:BIRON=Courses as swift as thought in every power,
Dialogue:BIRON=And gives to every power a double power,
Dialogue:BIRON=Above their functions and their offices.
Dialogue:BIRON=It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
Dialogue:BIRON=A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
Dialogue:BIRON=A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
Dialogue:BIRON=When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
Dialogue:BIRON=Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
Dialogue:BIRON=Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;
Dialogue:BIRON=Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
Dialogue:BIRON=For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
Dialogue:BIRON=Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
Dialogue:BIRON=Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
Dialogue:BIRON=As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
Dialogue:BIRON=And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
Dialogue:BIRON=Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
Dialogue:BIRON=Never durst poet touch a pen to write
Dialogue:BIRON=Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
Dialogue:BIRON=O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
Dialogue:BIRON=And plant in tyrants mild humility.
Dialogue:BIRON=From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
Dialogue:BIRON=They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
Dialogue:BIRON=They are the books, the arts, the academes,
Dialogue:BIRON=That show, contain and nourish all the world:
Dialogue:BIRON=Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
Dialogue:BIRON=Then fools you were these women to forswear,
Dialogue:BIRON=Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
Dialogue:BIRON=For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
Dialogue:BIRON=Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
Dialogue:BIRON=Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
Dialogue:BIRON=Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
Dialogue:BIRON=Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
Dialogue:BIRON=Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
Dialogue:BIRON=It is religion to be thus forsworn,
Dialogue:BIRON=For charity itself fulfills the law,
Dialogue:BIRON=And who can sever love from charity?
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!
Dialogue:BIRON=Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
Dialogue:BIRON=Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
Dialogue:BIRON=In conflict that you get the sun of them.
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And win them too: therefore let us devise
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Some entertainment for them in their tents.
Dialogue:BIRON=First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
Dialogue:BIRON=Then homeward every man attach the hand
Dialogue:BIRON=Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
Dialogue:BIRON=We will with some strange pastime solace them,
Dialogue:BIRON=Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
Dialogue:BIRON=For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
Dialogue:BIRON=Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Away, away! no time shall be omitted
Dialogue:FERDINAND=That will betime, and may by us be fitted.
Dialogue:BIRON=Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;

Dialogue:MOTH=Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=What is the figure? what is the figure?
Dialogue:MOTH=Horns.

Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=Or mons, the hill.
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=I do, sans question.
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=affection to congratulate the princess at her
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=rude multitude call the afternoon.
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=assure you, sir, I do assure.
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=head: and among other important and most serious
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=curate and your sweet self are good at such
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=crave your assistance.
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=our assistants, at the king's command, and this most
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=the princess; I say none so fit as to present the
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=Nine Worthies.
Dialogue:SIR NATHANIEL=Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=page, Hercules,--
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.
Dialogue:MOTH=An excellent device! so, if any of the audience
Dialogue:MOTH=hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou
Dialogue:MOTH=crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an
Dialogue:MOTH=offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=For the rest of the Worthies?--
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=I will play three myself.
Dialogue:MOTH=Thrice-worthy gentleman!
Dialogue:MOTH=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=Shall I tell you a thing?
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=We attend.
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=DON
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I
Dialogue:ADRIANO DE ARMADO=beseech you, follow.
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.
Dialogue:DULL=Nor understood none neither, sir.
Dialogue:HOLOFERNES=Allons! we will employ thee.
Dialogue:DULL=I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play
Dialogue:DULL=On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.

Dialogue:PRINCESS=Look you what I have from the loving king.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Madame, came nothing else along with that?
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
Dialogue:PRINCESS=As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=That was the way to make his godhead wax,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=For he hath been five thousand years a boy.
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.
Dialogue:KATHARINE=He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
Dialogue:KATHARINE=And so she died: had she been light, like you,
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
Dialogue:KATHARINE=She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:
Dialogue:KATHARINE=And so may you; for a light heart lives long.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
Dialogue:KATHARINE=A light condition in a beauty dark.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=We need more light to find your meaning out.
Dialogue:KATHARINE=You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.
Dialogue:KATHARINE=So do not you, for you are a light wench.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.
Dialogue:KATHARINE=You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=But Rosaline, you have a favour too:
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Who sent it? and what is it?
Dialogue:ROSALINE=I would you knew:
Dialogue:ROSALINE=An if my face were but as fair as yours,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=My favour were as great; be witness this.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:
Dialogue:ROSALINE=The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
Dialogue:ROSALINE=I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Any thing like?
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
Dialogue:ROSALINE='Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=My red dominical, my golden letter:
Dialogue:ROSALINE=O, that your face were not so full of O's!
Dialogue:KATHARINE=A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Madam, this glove.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=                  Did he not send you twain?
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Yes, madam, and moreover
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
Dialogue:KATHARINE=A huge translation of hypocrisy,
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.
Dialogue:MARIA=This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
Dialogue:MARIA=The letter is too long by half a mile.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
Dialogue:PRINCESS=The chain were longer and the letter short?
Dialogue:MARIA=Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
Dialogue:ROSALINE=O that I knew he were but in by the week!
Dialogue:ROSALINE=How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
Dialogue:ROSALINE=And wait the season and observe the times
Dialogue:ROSALINE=And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
Dialogue:ROSALINE=And shape his service wholly to my hests
Dialogue:ROSALINE=And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
Dialogue:ROSALINE=So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
Dialogue:ROSALINE=That he should be my fool and I his fate.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
Dialogue:PRINCESS=And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=The blood of youth burns not with such excess
Dialogue:ROSALINE=As gravity's revolt to wantonness.
Dialogue:MARIA=Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
Dialogue:MARIA=As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
Dialogue:MARIA=Since all the power thereof it doth apply
Dialogue:MARIA=To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
Notice:Enter BOYET
Dialogue:BOYET=O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Thy news Boyet?
Dialogue:BOYET=                  Prepare, madam, prepare!
Dialogue:BOYET=Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
Dialogue:BOYET=Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
Dialogue:BOYET=Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
Dialogue:BOYET=Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
Dialogue:BOYET=Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
Dialogue:PRINCESS=That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.
Dialogue:BOYET=Under the cool shade of a sycamore
Dialogue:BOYET=I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
Dialogue:BOYET=When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
Dialogue:BOYET=Toward that shade I might behold addrest
Dialogue:BOYET=The king and his companions: warily
Dialogue:BOYET=I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
Dialogue:BOYET=And overheard what you shall overhear,
Dialogue:BOYET=That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
Dialogue:BOYET=Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
Dialogue:BOYET=That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
Dialogue:BOYET=Action and accent did they teach him there;
Dialogue:BOYET='Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
Dialogue:BOYET=And ever and anon they made a doubt
Dialogue:BOYET=Presence majestical would put him out,
Dialogue:BOYET='For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
Dialogue:BOYET=Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
Dialogue:BOYET=The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
Dialogue:BOYET=I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
Dialogue:BOYET=With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
Dialogue:BOYET=Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
Dialogue:BOYET=One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
Dialogue:BOYET=A better speech was never spoke before;
Dialogue:BOYET=Another, with his finger and his thumb,
Dialogue:BOYET=Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
Dialogue:BOYET=The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'
Dialogue:BOYET=The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
Dialogue:BOYET=With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
Dialogue:BOYET=With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
Dialogue:BOYET=That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
Dialogue:BOYET=To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=But what, but what, come they to visit us?
Dialogue:BOYET=They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.
Dialogue:BOYET=Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
Dialogue:BOYET=Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
Dialogue:BOYET=And every one his love-feat will advance
Dialogue:BOYET=Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
Dialogue:BOYET=By favours several which they did bestow.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=And not a man of them shall have the grace,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=And then the king will court thee for his dear;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=And change your favours too; so shall your loves
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.
Dialogue:KATHARINE=But in this changing what is your intent?
Dialogue:PRINCESS=The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
Dialogue:PRINCESS=They do it but in mocking merriment;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=And mock for mock is only my intent.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Their several counsels they unbosom shall
Dialogue:PRINCESS=To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Upon the next occasion that we meet,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=With visages displayed, to talk and greet.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=But shall we dance, if they desire to't?
Dialogue:PRINCESS=No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.
Dialogue:BOYET=Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
Dialogue:BOYET=And quite divorce his memory from his part.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
Dialogue:PRINCESS=The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
Dialogue:PRINCESS=There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
Dialogue:PRINCESS=So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.

Dialogue:MOTH=Not to behold--
Dialogue:BIRON=[Aside to MOTH]  Once to behold, rogue.
Dialogue:MOTH=Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,
Dialogue:MOTH=--with your sun-beamed eyes--
Dialogue:BOYET=They will not answer to that epithet;
Dialogue:BOYET=You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'
Dialogue:MOTH=They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
Dialogue:BIRON=Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!
Notice:Exit MOTH
Dialogue:ROSALINE=What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:
Dialogue:ROSALINE=If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:
Dialogue:ROSALINE=That some plain man recount their purposes

Dialogue:BOYET=What would you with the princess?
Dialogue:BIRON=Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=What would they, say they?
Dialogue:BOYET=Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
Dialogue:BOYET=She says, you have it, and you may be gone.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Say to her, we have measured many miles
Dialogue:FERDINAND=To tread a measure with her on this grass.
Dialogue:BOYET=They say, that they have measured many a mile
Dialogue:BOYET=To tread a measure with you on this grass.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=It is not so. Ask them how many inches
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Is in one mile: if they have measured many,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=The measure then of one is easily told.
Dialogue:BOYET=If to come hither you have measured miles,
Dialogue:BOYET=And many miles, the princess bids you tell
Dialogue:BOYET=How many inches doth fill up one mile.
Dialogue:BIRON=Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.
Dialogue:BOYET=She hears herself.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=                  How many weary steps,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Are number'd in the travel of one mile?
Dialogue:BIRON=We number nothing that we spend for you:
Dialogue:BIRON=Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
Dialogue:BIRON=That we may do it still without accompt.
Dialogue:BIRON=Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
Dialogue:BIRON=That we, like savages, may worship it.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.

Dialogue:FERDINAND=Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.
Notice:Music plays
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
Dialogue:ROSALINE=You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Our ears vouchsafe it.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=But your legs should do it.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Why take we hands, then?
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Only to part friends:
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=More measure of this measure; be not nice.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=We can afford no more at such a price.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Your absence only.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=                  That can never be.

Dialogue:KATHARINE=                  No, a fair lord calf.
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=Let's part the word.

Dialogue:PRINCESS=O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
Dialogue:PRINCESS=This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=O, they were all in lamentable cases!
Dialogue:ROSALINE=The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Biron did swear himself out of all suit.
Dialogue:MARIA=Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
Dialogue:MARIA=No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.

Dialogue:BIRON=And utters it again when God doth please:

Dialogue:BIRON=At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
Dialogue:BIRON=And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
Dialogue:BIRON=Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
Dialogue:BIRON=This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
Dialogue:BIRON=Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
Dialogue:BIRON=A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he

Dialogue:BIRON=This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
Dialogue:BIRON=That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
Dialogue:BIRON=In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
Dialogue:BIRON=A mean most meanly; and in ushering
Dialogue:BIRON=Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;

Dialogue:FERDINAND=Construe my speeches better, if you may.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=We came to visit you, and purpose now
Dialogue:FERDINAND=To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
Dialogue:FERDINAND=The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
Dialogue:PRINCESS=As the unsullied lily, I protest,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=A world of torments though I should endure,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=I would not yield to be your house's guest;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=So much I hate a breaking cause to be
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=O, you have lived in desolation here,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:
Dialogue:PRINCESS=A mess of Russians left us but of late.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=How, madam! Russians!
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Ay, in truth, my lord;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
Dialogue:ROSALINE=My lady, to the manner of the days,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=We four indeed confronted were with four
Dialogue:ROSALINE=In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=They did not bless us with one happy word.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.
Dialogue:BIRON=This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
Dialogue:BIRON=Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
Dialogue:BIRON=With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
Dialogue:BIRON=By light we lose light: your capacity
Dialogue:BIRON=Is of that nature that to your huge store
Dialogue:BIRON=Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--
Dialogue:BIRON=I am a fool, and full of poverty.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=But that you take what doth to you belong,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
Dialogue:BIRON=O, I am yours, and all that I possess!
Dialogue:ROSALINE=All the fool mine?
Dialogue:BIRON=                  I cannot give you less.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
Dialogue:BIRON=Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?
Dialogue:ROSALINE=There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
Dialogue:ROSALINE=That hid the worse and show'd the better face.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.
Dialogue:DUMAIN=Let us confess and turn it to a jest.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.

Dialogue:Here stand I=Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
Dialogue:Here stand I=Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
Dialogue:Here stand I=Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
Dialogue:Here stand I=I do forswear them; and I here protest,
Dialogue:Here stand I=By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--
Dialogue:Here stand I=Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
Dialogue:Here stand I=In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
Dialogue:Here stand I=And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
Dialogue:Here stand I=My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Sans sans, I pray you.
Dialogue:BIRON=Yet I have a trick
Dialogue:BIRON=Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
Dialogue:BIRON=I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
Dialogue:BIRON=Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
Dialogue:BIRON=They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
Dialogue:BIRON=They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
Dialogue:BIRON=These lords are visited; you are not free,
Dialogue:BIRON=For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
Dialogue:BIRON=Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=It is not so; for how can this be true,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?
Dialogue:BIRON=Peace! for I will not have to do with you.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
Dialogue:BIRON=Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Some fair excuse.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=                  The fairest is confession.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Were not you here but even now disguised?
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Madam, I was.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=                  And were you well advised?
Dialogue:FERDINAND=I was, fair madam.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=                  When you then were here,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=What did you whisper in your lady's ear?
Dialogue:FERDINAND=That more than all the world I did respect her.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Upon mine honour, no.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Peace, peace! forbear:
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=What did the Russian whisper in your ear?
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
Dialogue:ROSALINE=As precious eyesight, and did value me
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Above this world; adding thereto moreover
Dialogue:ROSALINE=That he would wed me, or else die my lover.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Most honourably doth unhold his word.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=I never swore this lady such an oath.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=My faith and this the princess I did give:
Dialogue:FERDINAND=I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=What, will you have me, or your pearl again?
Dialogue:BIRON=Neither of either; I remit both twain.
Dialogue:BIRON=I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
Dialogue:BIRON=Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
Dialogue:BIRON=To dash it like a Christmas comedy:
Dialogue:BIRON=Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
Dialogue:BIRON=Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
Dialogue:BIRON=That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
Dialogue:BIRON=To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
Dialogue:BIRON=Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
Dialogue:BIRON=The ladies did change favours: and then we,
Dialogue:BIRON=Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
Dialogue:BIRON=Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
Dialogue:BIRON=We are again forsworn, in will and error.
Dialogue:BIRON=Much upon this it is: and might not you

Dialogue:FERDINAND=That which long process could not arbitrate:
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And though the mourning brow of progeny
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
Dialogue:FERDINAND=The holy suit which fain it would convince,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
Dialogue:FERDINAND=From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
Dialogue:FERDINAND=As to rejoice at friends but newly found.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=I understand you not: my griefs are double.
Dialogue:BIRON=Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
Dialogue:BIRON=And by these badges understand the king.
Dialogue:BIRON=For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
Dialogue:BIRON=Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
Dialogue:BIRON=Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours
Dialogue:BIRON=Even to the opposed end of our intents:
Dialogue:BIRON=And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
Dialogue:BIRON=As love is full of unbefitting strains,
Dialogue:BIRON=All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
Dialogue:BIRON=Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
Dialogue:BIRON=Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
Dialogue:BIRON=Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
Dialogue:BIRON=To every varied object in his glance:
Dialogue:BIRON=Which parti-coated presence of loose love
Dialogue:BIRON=Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
Dialogue:BIRON=Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
Dialogue:BIRON=Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
Dialogue:BIRON=Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
Dialogue:BIRON=Our love being yours, the error that love makes
Dialogue:BIRON=Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
Dialogue:BIRON=By being once false for ever to be true
Dialogue:BIRON=To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
Dialogue:BIRON=And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
Dialogue:BIRON=Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=We have received your letters full of love;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=And, in our maiden council, rated them
Dialogue:PRINCESS=At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=As bombast and as lining to the time:
Dialogue:PRINCESS=But more devout than this in our respects
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
Dialogue:PRINCESS=In their own fashion, like a merriment.
Dialogue:DUMAIN=Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=So did our looks.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=                  We did not quote them so.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Grant us your loves.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=A time, methinks, too short
Dialogue:PRINCESS=To make a world-without-end bargain in.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
Dialogue:PRINCESS=If for my love, as there is no such cause,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
Dialogue:PRINCESS=To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=There stay until the twelve celestial signs
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Have brought about the annual reckoning.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=If this austere insociable life
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=But that it bear this trial and last love;
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Then, at the expiration of the year,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine
Dialogue:PRINCESS=I will be thine; and till that instant shut
Dialogue:PRINCESS=My woeful self up in a mourning house,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Raining the tears of lamentation
Dialogue:PRINCESS=For the remembrance of my father's death.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
Dialogue:PRINCESS=Neither entitled in the other's heart.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=If this, or more than this, I would deny,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
Dialogue:DUMAIN=But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?
Dialogue:KATHARINE=A beard, fair health, and honesty;
Dialogue:KATHARINE=With three-fold love I wish you all these three.
Dialogue:DUMAIN=O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
Dialogue:KATHARINE=I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Come when the king doth to my lady come;
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
Dialogue:DUMAIN=I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
Dialogue:KATHARINE=Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=What says Maria?
Dialogue:MARIA=                  At the twelvemonth's end
Dialogue:MARIA=I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
Dialogue:LONGAVILLE=I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.
Dialogue:MARIA=The liker you; few taller are so young.
Dialogue:BIRON=Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
Dialogue:BIRON=Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
Dialogue:BIRON=What humble suit attends thy answer there:
Dialogue:BIRON=Impose some service on me for thy love.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Which you on all estates will execute
Dialogue:ROSALINE=That lie within the mercy of your wit.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=And therewithal to win me, if you please,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Without the which I am not to be won,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Visit the speechless sick and still converse
Dialogue:ROSALINE=With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
Dialogue:ROSALINE=To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
Dialogue:BIRON=To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
Dialogue:BIRON=It cannot be; it is impossible:
Dialogue:BIRON=Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
Dialogue:ROSALINE=A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=And I will have you and that fault withal;
Dialogue:ROSALINE=But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=And I shall find you empty of that fault,
Dialogue:ROSALINE=Right joyful of your reformation.
Dialogue:BIRON=A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,
Dialogue:BIRON=I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.
Dialogue:PRINCESS=[To FERDINAND]  Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=No, madam; we will bring you on your way.
Dialogue:BIRON=Our wooing doth not end like an old play;
Dialogue:BIRON=Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
Dialogue:BIRON=Might well have made our sport a comedy.
Dialogue:FERDINAND=Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,
Dialogue:FERDINAND=And then 'twill end.
Dialogue:BIRON=That's too long for a play.
