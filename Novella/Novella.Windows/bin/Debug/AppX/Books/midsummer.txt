Dialogue#THESEUS=Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
Dialogue#THESEUS=Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
Dialogue#THESEUS=Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
Dialogue#THESEUS=This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
Dialogue#THESEUS=Like to a step-dame or a dowager
Dialogue#THESEUS=Long withering out a young man revenue.
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=And then the moon, like to a silver bow
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=Of our solemnities.
Dialogue#THESEUS=Go, Philostrate,
Dialogue#THESEUS=Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
Dialogue#THESEUS=Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
Dialogue#THESEUS=Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
Dialogue#THESEUS=The pale companion is not for our pomp.
Notice#Exit PHILOSTRATE
Dialogue#THESEUS=Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
Dialogue#THESEUS=And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
Dialogue#THESEUS=But I will wed thee in another key,
Dialogue#THESEUS=With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.
Notice#Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS
Dialogue#EGEUS=Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!
Dialogue#THESEUS=Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?
Dialogue#EGEUS=Full of vexation come I, with complaint
Dialogue#EGEUS=Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
Dialogue#EGEUS=Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
Dialogue#EGEUS=This man hath my consent to marry her.
Dialogue#EGEUS=Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
Dialogue#EGEUS=This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
Dialogue#EGEUS=Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
Dialogue#EGEUS=And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
Dialogue#EGEUS=Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
Dialogue#EGEUS=With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
Dialogue#EGEUS=And stolen the impression of her fantasy
Dialogue#EGEUS=With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
Dialogue#EGEUS=Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
Dialogue#EGEUS=Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
Dialogue#EGEUS=With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
Dialogue#EGEUS=Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
Dialogue#EGEUS=To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
Dialogue#EGEUS=Be it so she; will not here before your grace
Dialogue#EGEUS=Consent to marry with Demetrius,
Dialogue#EGEUS=I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
Dialogue#EGEUS=As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
Dialogue#EGEUS=Which shall be either to this gentleman
Dialogue#EGEUS=Or to her death, according to our law
Dialogue#EGEUS=Immediately provided in that case.
Dialogue#THESEUS=What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
Dialogue#THESEUS=To you your father should be as a god;
Dialogue#THESEUS=One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
Dialogue#THESEUS=To whom you are but as a form in wax
Dialogue#THESEUS=By him imprinted and within his power
Dialogue#THESEUS=To leave the figure or disfigure it.
Dialogue#THESEUS=Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
Dialogue#HERMIA=So is Lysander.
Dialogue#THESEUS=                  In himself he is;
Dialogue#THESEUS=But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
Dialogue#THESEUS=The other must be held the worthier.
Dialogue#HERMIA=I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
Dialogue#THESEUS=Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
Dialogue#HERMIA=I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
Dialogue#HERMIA=I know not by what power I am made bold,
Dialogue#HERMIA=Nor how it may concern my modesty,
Dialogue#HERMIA=In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
Dialogue#HERMIA=But I beseech your grace that I may know
Dialogue#HERMIA=The worst that may befall me in this case,
Dialogue#HERMIA=If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
Dialogue#THESEUS=Either to die the death or to abjure
Dialogue#THESEUS=For ever the society of men.
Dialogue#THESEUS=Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
Dialogue#THESEUS=Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
Dialogue#THESEUS=Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
Dialogue#THESEUS=You can endure the livery of a nun,
Dialogue#THESEUS=For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
Dialogue#THESEUS=To live a barren sister all your life,
Dialogue#THESEUS=Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Dialogue#THESEUS=Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
Dialogue#THESEUS=To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
Dialogue#THESEUS=But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
Dialogue#THESEUS=Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
Dialogue#THESEUS=Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.
Dialogue#HERMIA=So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
Dialogue#HERMIA=Ere I will my virgin patent up
Dialogue#HERMIA=Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
Dialogue#HERMIA=My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
Dialogue#THESEUS=Take time to pause; and, by the next new moon--
Dialogue#THESEUS=The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
Dialogue#THESEUS=For everlasting bond of fellowship--
Dialogue#THESEUS=Upon that day either prepare to die
Dialogue#THESEUS=For disobedience to your father's will,
Dialogue#THESEUS=Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
Dialogue#THESEUS=Or on Diana's altar to protest
Dialogue#THESEUS=For aye austerity and single life.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Thy crazed title to my certain right.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=You have her father's love, Demetrius;
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
Dialogue#EGEUS=Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
Dialogue#EGEUS=And what is mine my love shall render him.
Dialogue#EGEUS=And she is mine, and all my right of her
Dialogue#EGEUS=I do estate unto Demetrius.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
Dialogue#LYSANDER=My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
Dialogue#LYSANDER=And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Why should not I then prosecute my right?
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
Dialogue#THESEUS=I must confess that I have heard so much,
Dialogue#THESEUS=And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
Dialogue#THESEUS=But, being over-full of self-affairs,
Dialogue#THESEUS=My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
Dialogue#THESEUS=And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
Dialogue#THESEUS=I have some private schooling for you both.
Dialogue#THESEUS=For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
Dialogue#THESEUS=To fit your fancies to your father's will;
Dialogue#THESEUS=Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
Dialogue#THESEUS=Which by no means we may extenuate--
Dialogue#THESEUS=To death, or to a vow of single life.
Dialogue#THESEUS=Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
Dialogue#THESEUS=Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
Dialogue#THESEUS=I must employ you in some business
Dialogue#THESEUS=Against our nuptial and confer with you
Dialogue#THESEUS=Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
Dialogue#EGEUS=With duty and desire we follow you.
Notice#Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA
Dialogue#LYSANDER=How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
Dialogue#LYSANDER=How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
Dialogue#HERMIA=Belike for want of rain, which I could well
Dialogue#HERMIA=Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Could ever hear by tale or history,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=The course of true love never did run smooth;
Dialogue#LYSANDER=But, either it was different in blood,--
Dialogue#HERMIA=O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--
Dialogue#HERMIA=O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
Dialogue#HERMIA=O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Making it momentany as a sound,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
Dialogue#LYSANDER=The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
Dialogue#LYSANDER=So quick bright things come to confusion.
Dialogue#HERMIA=If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
Dialogue#HERMIA=It stands as an edict in destiny:
Dialogue#HERMIA=Then let us teach our trial patience,
Dialogue#HERMIA=Because it is a customary cross,
Dialogue#HERMIA=As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
Dialogue#HERMIA=Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=I have a widow aunt, a dowager
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
Dialogue#LYSANDER=From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
Dialogue#LYSANDER=And she respects me as her only son.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
Dialogue#LYSANDER=And to that place the sharp Athenian law
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
Dialogue#LYSANDER=And in the wood, a league without the town,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=To do observance to a morn of May,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=There will I stay for thee.
Dialogue#HERMIA=My good Lysander!
Dialogue#HERMIA=I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
Dialogue#HERMIA=By his best arrow with the golden head,
Dialogue#HERMIA=By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
Dialogue#HERMIA=By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
Dialogue#HERMIA=And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
Dialogue#HERMIA=When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
Dialogue#HERMIA=By all the vows that ever men have broke,
Dialogue#HERMIA=In number more than ever women spoke,
Dialogue#HERMIA=In that same place thou hast appointed me,
Dialogue#HERMIA=To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
Notice#Enter HELENA
Dialogue#HERMIA=God speed fair Helena! whither away?
Dialogue#HELENA=Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
Dialogue#HELENA=Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
Dialogue#HELENA=Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
Dialogue#HELENA=More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
Dialogue#HELENA=When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
Dialogue#HELENA=Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
Dialogue#HELENA=Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
Dialogue#HELENA=My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
Dialogue#HELENA=My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
Dialogue#HELENA=Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
Dialogue#HELENA=The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
Dialogue#HELENA=O, teach me how you look, and with what art
Dialogue#HELENA=You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
Dialogue#HERMIA=I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
Dialogue#HELENA=O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
Dialogue#HERMIA=I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
Dialogue#HELENA=O that my prayers could such affection move!
Dialogue#HERMIA=The more I hate, the more he follows me.
Dialogue#HELENA=The more I love, the more he hateth me.
Dialogue#HERMIA=His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
Dialogue#HELENA=None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
Dialogue#HERMIA=Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
Dialogue#HERMIA=Lysander and myself will fly this place.
Dialogue#HERMIA=Before the time I did Lysander see,
Dialogue#HERMIA=Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
Dialogue#HERMIA=O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
Dialogue#HERMIA=That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
Dialogue#LYSANDER=To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Her silver visage in the watery glass,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
Dialogue#HERMIA=And in the wood, where often you and I
Dialogue#HERMIA=Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
Dialogue#HERMIA=Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
Dialogue#HERMIA=There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
Dialogue#HERMIA=And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
Dialogue#HERMIA=To seek new friends and stranger companies.
Dialogue#HERMIA=Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
Dialogue#HERMIA=And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
Dialogue#HERMIA=Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
Dialogue#HERMIA=From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=I will, my Hermia.
Notice#Exit HERMIA
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Helena, adieu:
Dialogue#LYSANDER=As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#HELENA=How happy some o'er other some can be!
Dialogue#HELENA=Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
Dialogue#HELENA=But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
Dialogue#HELENA=He will not know what all but he do know:
Dialogue#HELENA=And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
Dialogue#HELENA=So I, admiring of his qualities:
Dialogue#HELENA=Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
Dialogue#HELENA=Love can transpose to form and dignity:
Dialogue#HELENA=Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
Dialogue#HELENA=And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
Dialogue#HELENA=Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
Dialogue#HELENA=Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
Dialogue#HELENA=And therefore is Love said to be a child,
Dialogue#HELENA=Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
Dialogue#HELENA=As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
Dialogue#HELENA=So the boy Love is perjured every where:
Dialogue#HELENA=For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
Dialogue#HELENA=He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
Dialogue#HELENA=And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
Dialogue#HELENA=So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
Dialogue#HELENA=I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
Dialogue#HELENA=Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
Dialogue#HELENA=Pursue her; and for this intelligence
Dialogue#HELENA=If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
Dialogue#HELENA=But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
Dialogue#HELENA=To have his sight thither and back again.

Banner#SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.
Notice#Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING
Dialogue#QUINCE=Is all our company here?
Dialogue#BOTTOM=You were best to call them generally, man by man,
Dialogue#BOTTOM=according to the scrip.
Dialogue#QUINCE=Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is
Dialogue#QUINCE=thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
Dialogue#QUINCE=interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
Dialogue#QUINCE=wedding-day at night.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
Dialogue#BOTTOM=on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
Dialogue#BOTTOM=to a point.
Dialogue#QUINCE=Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and
Dialogue#QUINCE=most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
Dialogue#BOTTOM=merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
Dialogue#BOTTOM=actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.
Dialogue#QUINCE=Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
Dialogue#QUINCE=You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?
Dialogue#QUINCE=A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=That will ask some tears in the true performing of
Dialogue#BOTTOM=it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
Dialogue#BOTTOM=eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
Dialogue#BOTTOM=measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
Dialogue#BOTTOM=tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
Dialogue#BOTTOM=tear a cat in, to make all split.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=The raging rocks
Dialogue#BOTTOM=And shivering shocks
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Shall break the locks
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Of prison gates;
Dialogue#BOTTOM=And Phibbus' car
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Shall shine from far
Dialogue#BOTTOM=And make and mar
Dialogue#BOTTOM=The foolish Fates.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
Dialogue#BOTTOM=more condoling.
Dialogue#QUINCE=Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
Dialogue#FLUTE=Here, Peter Quince.
Dialogue#QUINCE=Flute, you must take Thisby on you.
Dialogue#FLUTE=What is Thisby? a wandering knight?
Dialogue#QUINCE=It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
Dialogue#FLUTE=Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.
Dialogue#QUINCE=That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and
Dialogue#QUINCE=you may speak as small as you will.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
Dialogue#BOTTOM=speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
Dialogue#BOTTOM=and lady dear!'
Dialogue#QUINCE=No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Well, proceed.
Dialogue#QUINCE=Robin Starveling, the tailor.
Dialogue#STARVELING=Here, Peter Quince.
Dialogue#QUINCE=Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
Dialogue#QUINCE=Tom Snout, the tinker.
Dialogue#SNOUT=Here, Peter Quince.
Dialogue#QUINCE=You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:
Dialogue#QUINCE=Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I
Dialogue#QUINCE=hope, here is a play fitted.
Dialogue#SNUG=Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it
Dialogue#SNUG=be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
Dialogue#QUINCE=You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
Dialogue#BOTTOM=do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,
Dialogue#BOTTOM=that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
Dialogue#BOTTOM=let him roar again.'
Dialogue#QUINCE=An you should do it too terribly, you would fright
Dialogue#QUINCE=the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
Dialogue#QUINCE=and that were enough to hang us all.
Dialogue#ALL=That would hang us, every mother's son.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
Dialogue#BOTTOM=ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
Dialogue#BOTTOM=discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
Dialogue#BOTTOM=voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
Dialogue#BOTTOM=sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
Dialogue#BOTTOM=nightingale.
Dialogue#QUINCE=You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
Dialogue#QUINCE=sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
Dialogue#QUINCE=summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
Dialogue#QUINCE=therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
Dialogue#BOTTOM=to play it in?
Dialogue#QUINCE=Why, what you will.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
Dialogue#BOTTOM=beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
Dialogue#BOTTOM=beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
Dialogue#BOTTOM=perfect yellow.
Dialogue#QUINCE=Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
Dialogue#QUINCE=then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
Dialogue#QUINCE=are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
Dialogue#QUINCE=you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
Dialogue#QUINCE=and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
Dialogue#QUINCE=town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
Dialogue#QUINCE=we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
Dialogue#QUINCE=company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
Dialogue#QUINCE=will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
Dialogue#QUINCE=wants. I pray you, fail me not.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
Dialogue#BOTTOM=obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.
Dialogue#QUINCE=At the duke's oak we meet.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.

Banner#SCENE I. A wood near Athens.
Notice#Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK
Dialogue#PUCK=How now, spirit! whither wander you?
Dialogue#Fairy=     Over hill, over dale,
Dialogue#Fairy=Thorough bush, thorough brier,
Dialogue#Fairy=Over park, over pale,
Dialogue#Fairy=Thorough flood, thorough fire,
Dialogue#Fairy=I do wander everywhere,
Dialogue#Fairy=Swifter than the moon's sphere;
Dialogue#Fairy=And I serve the fairy queen,
Dialogue#Fairy=To dew her orbs upon the green.
Dialogue#Fairy=The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
Dialogue#Fairy=In their gold coats spots you see;
Dialogue#Fairy=Those be rubies, fairy favours,
Dialogue#Fairy=In those freckles live their savours:
Dialogue#Fairy=I must go seek some dewdrops here
Dialogue#Fairy=And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
Dialogue#Fairy=Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
Dialogue#Fairy=Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
Dialogue#PUCK=The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
Dialogue#PUCK=Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
Dialogue#PUCK=For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
Dialogue#PUCK=Because that she as her attendant hath
Dialogue#PUCK=A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
Dialogue#PUCK=She never had so sweet a changeling;
Dialogue#PUCK=And jealous Oberon would have the child
Dialogue#PUCK=Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
Dialogue#PUCK=But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
Dialogue#PUCK=Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
Dialogue#PUCK=And now they never meet in grove or green,
Dialogue#PUCK=By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
Dialogue#PUCK=But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
Dialogue#PUCK=Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
Dialogue#Fairy=Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
Dialogue#Fairy=Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
Dialogue#Fairy=Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
Dialogue#Fairy=That frights the maidens of the villagery;
Dialogue#Fairy=Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern
Dialogue#Fairy=And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
Dialogue#Fairy=And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
Dialogue#Fairy=Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
Dialogue#Fairy=Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
Dialogue#Fairy=You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
Dialogue#Fairy=Are not you he?
Dialogue#PUCK=                  Thou speak'st aright;
Dialogue#PUCK=I am that merry wanderer of the night.
Dialogue#PUCK=I jest to Oberon and make him smile
Dialogue#PUCK=When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
Dialogue#PUCK=Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
Dialogue#PUCK=And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
Dialogue#PUCK=In very likeness of a roasted crab,
Dialogue#PUCK=And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
Dialogue#PUCK=And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
Dialogue#PUCK=The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
Dialogue#PUCK=Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
Dialogue#PUCK=Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
Dialogue#PUCK=And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
Dialogue#PUCK=And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
Dialogue#PUCK=And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
Dialogue#PUCK=A merrier hour was never wasted there.
Dialogue#PUCK=But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.
Dialogue#Fairy=And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!
Notice#Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train; from the other, TITANIA, with hers
Dialogue#OBERON=Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
Dialogue#TITANIA=What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:
Dialogue#TITANIA=I have forsworn his bed and company.
Dialogue#OBERON=Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?
Dialogue#TITANIA=Then I must be thy lady: but I know
Dialogue#TITANIA=When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
Dialogue#TITANIA=And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
Dialogue#TITANIA=Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
Dialogue#TITANIA=To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
Dialogue#TITANIA=Come from the farthest Steppe of India?
Dialogue#TITANIA=But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
Dialogue#TITANIA=Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
Dialogue#TITANIA=To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
Dialogue#TITANIA=To give their bed joy and prosperity.
Dialogue#OBERON=How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,
Dialogue#OBERON=Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
Dialogue#OBERON=Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
Dialogue#OBERON=Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
Dialogue#OBERON=From Perigenia, whom he ravished?
Dialogue#OBERON=And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,
Dialogue#OBERON=With Ariadne and Antiopa?
Dialogue#TITANIA=These are the forgeries of jealousy:
Dialogue#TITANIA=And never, since the middle summer's spring,
Dialogue#TITANIA=Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,
Dialogue#TITANIA=By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
Dialogue#TITANIA=Or in the beached margent of the sea,
Dialogue#TITANIA=To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
Dialogue#TITANIA=But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
Dialogue#TITANIA=Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
Dialogue#TITANIA=As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
Dialogue#TITANIA=Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
Dialogue#TITANIA=Have every pelting river made so proud
Dialogue#TITANIA=That they have overborne their continents:
Dialogue#TITANIA=The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
Dialogue#TITANIA=The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
Dialogue#TITANIA=Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
Dialogue#TITANIA=The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
Dialogue#TITANIA=And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
Dialogue#TITANIA=The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
Dialogue#TITANIA=And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
Dialogue#TITANIA=For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
Dialogue#TITANIA=The human mortals want their winter here;
Dialogue#TITANIA=No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
Dialogue#TITANIA=Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
Dialogue#TITANIA=Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
Dialogue#TITANIA=That rheumatic diseases do abound:
Dialogue#TITANIA=And thorough this distemperature we see
Dialogue#TITANIA=The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
Dialogue#TITANIA=Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
Dialogue#TITANIA=And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
Dialogue#TITANIA=An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
Dialogue#TITANIA=Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
Dialogue#TITANIA=The childing autumn, angry winter, change
Dialogue#TITANIA=Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
Dialogue#TITANIA=By their increase, now knows not which is which:
Dialogue#TITANIA=And this same progeny of evils comes
Dialogue#TITANIA=From our debate, from our dissension;
Dialogue#TITANIA=We are their parents and original.
Dialogue#OBERON=Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
Dialogue#OBERON=Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
Dialogue#OBERON=I do but beg a little changeling boy,
Dialogue#OBERON=To be my henchman.
Dialogue#TITANIA=                  Set your heart at rest:
Dialogue#TITANIA=The fairy land buys not the child of me.
Dialogue#TITANIA=His mother was a votaress of my order:
Dialogue#TITANIA=And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
Dialogue#TITANIA=Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
Dialogue#TITANIA=And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
Dialogue#TITANIA=Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
Dialogue#TITANIA=When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
Dialogue#TITANIA=And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
Dialogue#TITANIA=Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
Dialogue#TITANIA=Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
Dialogue#TITANIA=Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
Dialogue#TITANIA=To fetch me trifles, and return again,
Dialogue#TITANIA=As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
Dialogue#TITANIA=But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
Dialogue#TITANIA=And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
Dialogue#TITANIA=And for her sake I will not part with him.
Dialogue#OBERON=How long within this wood intend you stay?
Dialogue#TITANIA=Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
Dialogue#TITANIA=If you will patiently dance in our round
Dialogue#TITANIA=And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
Dialogue#TITANIA=If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
Dialogue#OBERON=Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.
Dialogue#TITANIA=Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!
Dialogue#TITANIA=We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.
Notice#Exit TITANIA with her train
Dialogue#OBERON=Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
Dialogue#OBERON=Till I torment thee for this injury.
Dialogue#OBERON=My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest
Dialogue#OBERON=Since once I sat upon a promontory,
Dialogue#OBERON=And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
Dialogue#OBERON=Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
Dialogue#OBERON=That the rude sea grew civil at her song
Dialogue#OBERON=And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
Dialogue#OBERON=To hear the sea-maid's music.
Dialogue#PUCK=I remember.
Dialogue#OBERON=That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
Dialogue#OBERON=Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
Dialogue#OBERON=Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
Dialogue#OBERON=At a fair vestal throned by the west,
Dialogue#OBERON=And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
Dialogue#OBERON=As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
Dialogue#OBERON=But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
Dialogue#OBERON=Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
Dialogue#OBERON=And the imperial votaress passed on,
Dialogue#OBERON=In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
Dialogue#OBERON=Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
Dialogue#OBERON=It fell upon a little western flower,
Dialogue#OBERON=Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
Dialogue#OBERON=And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
Dialogue#OBERON=Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:
Dialogue#OBERON=The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
Dialogue#OBERON=Will make or man or woman madly dote
Dialogue#OBERON=Upon the next live creature that it sees.
Dialogue#OBERON=Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
Dialogue#OBERON=Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
Dialogue#PUCK=I'll put a girdle round about the earth
Dialogue#PUCK=In forty minutes.

Dialogue#OBERON=                  Having once this juice,

Dialogue#OBERON=The next thing then she waking looks upon,
Dialogue#OBERON=Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
Dialogue#OBERON=On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
Dialogue#OBERON=She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
Dialogue#OBERON=And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
Dialogue#OBERON=As I can take it with another herb,
Dialogue#OBERON=I'll make her render up her page to me.
Dialogue#OBERON=But who comes here? I am invisible;
Dialogue#OBERON=And I will overhear their conference.
Notice#Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=And here am I, and wode within this wood,
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
Dialogue#HELENA=You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
Dialogue#HELENA=But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
Dialogue#HELENA=Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,
Dialogue#HELENA=And I shall have no power to follow you.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?
Dialogue#HELENA=And even for that do I love you the more.
Dialogue#HELENA=I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
Dialogue#HELENA=The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:
Dialogue#HELENA=Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
Dialogue#HELENA=Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
Dialogue#HELENA=Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
Dialogue#HELENA=What worser place can I beg in your love,--
Dialogue#HELENA=And yet a place of high respect with me,--
Dialogue#HELENA=Than to be used as you use your dog?
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=For I am sick when I do look on thee.
Dialogue#HELENA=And I am sick when I look not on you.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=You do impeach your modesty too much,
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=To leave the city and commit yourself
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Into the hands of one that loves you not;
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=To trust the opportunity of night
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=And the ill counsel of a desert place
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=With the rich worth of your virginity.
Dialogue#HELENA=Your virtue is my privilege: for that
Dialogue#HELENA=It is not night when I do see your face,
Dialogue#HELENA=Therefore I think I am not in the night;
Dialogue#HELENA=Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
Dialogue#HELENA=For you in my respect are all the world:
Dialogue#HELENA=Then how can it be said I am alone,
Dialogue#HELENA=When all the world is here to look on me?
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
Dialogue#HELENA=The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
Dialogue#HELENA=Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
Dialogue#HELENA=Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
Dialogue#HELENA=The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
Dialogue#HELENA=Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,
Dialogue#HELENA=When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
Dialogue#HELENA=Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
Dialogue#HELENA=You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
Dialogue#HELENA=Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
Dialogue#HELENA=We cannot fight for love, as men may do;
Dialogue#HELENA=We should be wood and were not made to woo.

Dialogue#OBERON=Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
Dialogue#OBERON=Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
Dialogue#OBERON=With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
Dialogue#OBERON=There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
Dialogue#OBERON=Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
Dialogue#OBERON=And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
Dialogue#OBERON=Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
Dialogue#OBERON=And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
Dialogue#OBERON=And make her full of hateful fantasies.
Dialogue#OBERON=Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
Dialogue#OBERON=A sweet Athenian lady is in love
Dialogue#OBERON=With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
Dialogue#OBERON=But do it when the next thing he espies
Dialogue#OBERON=May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
Dialogue#OBERON=By the Athenian garments he hath on.
Dialogue#OBERON=Effect it with some care, that he may prove
Dialogue#OBERON=More fond on her than she upon her love:

Dialogue#BOTTOM=Are we all met?
Dialogue#QUINCE=Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place
Dialogue#QUINCE=for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
Dialogue#QUINCE=stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we
Dialogue#QUINCE=will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Peter Quince,--
Dialogue#QUINCE=What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
Dialogue#BOTTOM=There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
Dialogue#BOTTOM=draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
Dialogue#BOTTOM=cannot abide. How answer you that?
Dialogue#SNOUT=By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
Dialogue#STARVELING=I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
Dialogue#BOTTOM=say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
Dialogue#BOTTOM=better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
Dialogue#BOTTOM=out of fear.
Dialogue#QUINCE=Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
Dialogue#QUINCE=written in eight and six.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
Dialogue#SNOUT=Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
Dialogue#STARVELING=I fear it, I promise you.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
Dialogue#BOTTOM=bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
Dialogue#BOTTOM=most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
Dialogue#BOTTOM=wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
Dialogue#BOTTOM=look to 't.
Dialogue#SNOUT=Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
Dialogue#BOTTOM=be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
Dialogue#BOTTOM=must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
Dialogue#BOTTOM=defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish
Dialogue#BOTTOM=You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
Dialogue#BOTTOM=entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
Dialogue#BOTTOM=for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
Dialogue#BOTTOM=were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
Dialogue#BOTTOM=man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
Dialogue#BOTTOM=his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.
Dialogue#QUINCE=Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
Dialogue#QUINCE=that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,
Dialogue#QUINCE=you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.
Dialogue#SNOUT=Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
Dialogue#BOTTOM=A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find
Dialogue#BOTTOM=out moonshine, find out moonshine.
Dialogue#QUINCE=Yes, it doth shine that night.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Why, then may you leave a casement of the great
Dialogue#BOTTOM=chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon
Dialogue#BOTTOM=may shine in at the casement.
Dialogue#QUINCE=Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
Dialogue#QUINCE=and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to
Dialogue#QUINCE=present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is
Dialogue#QUINCE=another thing: we must have a wall in the great
Dialogue#QUINCE=chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did
Dialogue#QUINCE=talk through the chink of a wall.
Dialogue#SNOUT=You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
Dialogue#BOTTOM=Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
Dialogue#BOTTOM=have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast
Dialogue#BOTTOM=about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his
Dialogue#BOTTOM=fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus
Dialogue#BOTTOM=and Thisby whisper.
Dialogue#QUINCE=If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit  down,
Dialogue#QUINCE=every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.
Dialogue#QUINCE=Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
Dialogue#QUINCE=speech, enter into that brake: and so every one

Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=Which is as brief as I have known a play;
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=There is not one word apt, one player fitted:
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=The passion of loud laughter never shed.
Dialogue#THESEUS=What are they that do play it?
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=Which never labour'd in their minds till now,
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=With this same play, against your nuptial.
Dialogue#THESEUS=And we will hear it.
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=No, my noble lord;
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=It is not for you: I have heard it over,
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=Unless you can find sport in their intents,
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
Dialogue#PHILOSTRATE=To do you service.
Dialogue#THESEUS=                  I will hear that play;
Dialogue#THESEUS=For never anything can be amiss,
Dialogue#THESEUS=When simpleness and duty tender it.
Dialogue#THESEUS=Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.

Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=He says they can do nothing in this kind.
Dialogue#THESEUS=The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
Dialogue#THESEUS=Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
Dialogue#THESEUS=And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
Dialogue#THESEUS=Takes it in might, not merit.
Dialogue#THESEUS=Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
Dialogue#THESEUS=To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
Dialogue#THESEUS=Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
Dialogue#THESEUS=Make periods in the midst of sentences,
Dialogue#THESEUS=Throttle their practised accent in their fears
Dialogue#THESEUS=And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,
Dialogue#THESEUS=Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
Dialogue#THESEUS=Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
Dialogue#THESEUS=And in the modesty of fearful duty
Dialogue#THESEUS=I read as much as from the rattling tongue
Dialogue#THESEUS=Of saucy and audacious eloquence.

Dialogue#Prologue=That is the true beginning of our end.
Dialogue#Prologue=Consider then we come but in despite.
Dialogue#Prologue=We do not come as minding to contest you,
Dialogue#Prologue=Our true intent is. All for your delight
Dialogue#Prologue=We are not here. That you should here repent you,
Dialogue#Prologue=The actors are at hand and by their show
Dialogue#Prologue=You shall know all that you are like to know.
Dialogue#THESEUS=This fellow doth not stand upon points.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows
Dialogue#LYSANDER=not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not
Dialogue#LYSANDER=enough to speak, but to speak true.
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.
Dialogue#THESEUS=His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing
Dialogue#THESEUS=impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
Notice#Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion
Dialogue#Prologue=Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
Dialogue#Prologue=But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
Dialogue#Prologue=This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
Dialogue#Prologue=This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
Dialogue#Prologue=This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
Dialogue#Prologue=Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
Dialogue#Prologue=And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
Dialogue#Prologue=To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
Dialogue#Prologue=This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
Dialogue#Prologue=Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
Dialogue#Prologue=By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
Dialogue#Prologue=To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
Dialogue#Prologue=This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
Dialogue#Prologue=The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
Dialogue#Prologue=Did scare away, or rather did affright;
Dialogue#Prologue=And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
Dialogue#Prologue=Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
Dialogue#Prologue=Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
Dialogue#Prologue=And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:
Dialogue#Prologue=Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
Dialogue#Prologue=He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
Dialogue#Prologue=And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
Dialogue#Prologue=His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
Dialogue#Prologue=Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
Dialogue#Prologue=At large discourse, while here they do remain.
Notice#Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine
Dialogue#THESEUS=I wonder if the lion be to speak.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.
Dialogue#Wall=In this same interlude it doth befall
Dialogue#Wall=That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
Dialogue#Wall=And such a wall, as I would have you think,
Dialogue#Wall=That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
Dialogue#Wall=Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
Dialogue#Wall=Did whisper often very secretly.
Dialogue#Wall=This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show
Dialogue#Wall=That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
Dialogue#Wall=And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
Dialogue#Wall=Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
Dialogue#THESEUS=Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=discourse, my lord.
Notice#Enter Pyramus
Dialogue#THESEUS=Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!
Dialogue#Pyramus=O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
Dialogue#Pyramus=O night, which ever art when day is not!
Dialogue#Pyramus=O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,
Dialogue#Pyramus=I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
Dialogue#Pyramus=And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
Dialogue#Pyramus=That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!
Dialogue#Pyramus=Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
Dialogue#Pyramus=Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!
Notice#Wall holds up his fingers
Dialogue#Pyramus=Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
Dialogue#Pyramus=But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
Dialogue#Pyramus=O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
Dialogue#Pyramus=Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
Dialogue#THESEUS=The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
Dialogue#Pyramus=No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'
Dialogue#Pyramus=is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to
Dialogue#Pyramus=spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will
Dialogue#Pyramus=fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.
Notice#Enter Thisbe
Dialogue#Thisbe=O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,
Dialogue#Thisbe=For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
Dialogue#Thisbe=My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,
Dialogue#Thisbe=Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
Dialogue#Pyramus=I see a voice: now will I to the chink,
Dialogue#Pyramus=To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!
Dialogue#Thisbe=My love thou art, my love I think.
Dialogue#Pyramus=Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
Dialogue#Pyramus=And, like Limander, am I trusty still.
Dialogue#Thisbe=And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.
Dialogue#Pyramus=Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
Dialogue#Thisbe=As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
Dialogue#Pyramus=O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
Dialogue#Thisbe=I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
Dialogue#Pyramus=Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
Dialogue#Thisbe='Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.

Dialogue#THESEUS=Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=without warning.
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
Dialogue#THESEUS=The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst
Dialogue#THESEUS=are no worse, if imagination amend them.
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
Dialogue#THESEUS=If we imagine no worse of them than they of
Dialogue#THESEUS=themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here
Dialogue#THESEUS=come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.
Notice#Enter Lion and Moonshine
Dialogue#Lion=You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
Dialogue#Lion=The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
Dialogue#Lion=May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
Dialogue#Lion=When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
Dialogue#Lion=Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
Dialogue#Lion=A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;
Dialogue#Lion=For, if I should as lion come in strife
Dialogue#Lion=Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.
Dialogue#THESEUS=A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=This lion is a very fox for his valour.
Dialogue#THESEUS=True; and a goose for his discretion.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
Dialogue#THESEUS=His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;
Dialogue#THESEUS=for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:
Dialogue#THESEUS=leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.
Dialogue#Moonshine=This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=He should have worn the horns on his head.
Dialogue#THESEUS=He is no crescent, and his horns are
Dialogue#THESEUS=invisible within the circumference.
Dialogue#Moonshine=This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
Dialogue#Moonshine=Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.
Dialogue#THESEUS=This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man
Dialogue#THESEUS=should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the
Dialogue#THESEUS=man i' the moon?
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=He dares not come there for the candle; for, you
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=see, it is already in snuff.
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!
Dialogue#THESEUS=It appears, by his small light of discretion, that
Dialogue#THESEUS=he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all
Dialogue#THESEUS=reason, we must stay the time.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Proceed, Moon.
Dialogue#Moonshine=All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the
Dialogue#Moonshine=lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this
Dialogue#Moonshine=thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.
Notice#Enter Thisbe
Dialogue#Thisbe=This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
Dialogue#Lion=[Roaring]  Oh--
Notice#Thisbe runs off
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Well roared, Lion.
Dialogue#THESEUS=Well run, Thisbe.
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=good grace.
Notice#The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exit
Dialogue#THESEUS=Well moused, Lion.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=And so the lion vanished.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=And then came Pyramus.
Notice#Enter Pyramus
Dialogue#Pyramus=Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
Dialogue#Pyramus=I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
Dialogue#Pyramus=For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
Dialogue#Pyramus=I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
Dialogue#Pyramus=But stay, O spite!
Dialogue#Pyramus=But mark, poor knight,
Dialogue#Pyramus=What dreadful dole is here!
Dialogue#Pyramus=Eyes, do you see?
Dialogue#Pyramus=How can it be?
Dialogue#Pyramus=O dainty duck! O dear!
Dialogue#Pyramus=Thy mantle good,
Dialogue#Pyramus=What, stain'd with blood!
Dialogue#Pyramus=Approach, ye Furies fell!
Dialogue#Pyramus=O Fates, come, come,
Dialogue#Pyramus=Cut thread and thrum;
Dialogue#Pyramus=Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!
Dialogue#THESEUS=This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would
Dialogue#THESEUS=go near to make a man look sad.
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
Dialogue#Pyramus=O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
Dialogue#Pyramus=Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:
Dialogue#Pyramus=Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame
Dialogue#Pyramus=That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd
Dialogue#Pyramus=with cheer.
Dialogue#Pyramus=Come, tears, confound;
Dialogue#Pyramus=Out, sword, and wound
Dialogue#Pyramus=The pap of Pyramus;
Dialogue#Pyramus=Ay, that left pap,
Dialogue#Pyramus=Where heart doth hop:
Notice#Stabs himself
Dialogue#Pyramus=Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
Dialogue#Pyramus=Now am I dead,
Dialogue#Pyramus=Now am I fled;
Dialogue#Pyramus=My soul is in the sky:
Dialogue#Pyramus=Tongue, lose thy light;
Dialogue#Pyramus=Moon take thy flight:
Notice#Exit Moonshine
Dialogue#Pyramus=Now die, die, die, die, die.
Notice#Dies
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.
Dialogue#THESEUS=With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and
Dialogue#THESEUS=prove an ass.
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=back and finds her lover?
Dialogue#THESEUS=She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and
Dialogue#THESEUS=her passion ends the play.
Notice#Re-enter Thisbe
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
Dialogue#HIPPOLYTA=Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=she for a woman, God bless us.
Dialogue#LYSANDER=She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=And thus she means, videlicet:--
Dialogue#Thisbe=          Asleep, my love?
Dialogue#Thisbe=What, dead, my dove?
Dialogue#Thisbe=O Pyramus, arise!
Dialogue#Thisbe=Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
Dialogue#Thisbe=Dead, dead? A tomb
Dialogue#Thisbe=Must cover thy sweet eyes.
Dialogue#Thisbe=These My lips,
Dialogue#Thisbe=This cherry nose,
Dialogue#Thisbe=These yellow cowslip cheeks,
Dialogue#Thisbe=Are gone, are gone:
Dialogue#Thisbe=Lovers, make moan:
Dialogue#Thisbe=His eyes were green as leeks.
Dialogue#Thisbe=O Sisters Three,
Dialogue#Thisbe=Come, come to me,
Dialogue#Thisbe=With hands as pale as milk;
Dialogue#Thisbe=Lay them in gore,
Dialogue#Thisbe=Since you have shore
Dialogue#Thisbe=With shears his thread of silk.
Dialogue#Thisbe=Tongue, not a word:
Dialogue#Thisbe=Come, trusty sword;
Dialogue#Thisbe=Come, blade, my breast imbrue:

Dialogue#THESEUS=Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
Dialogue#DEMETRIUS=Ay, and Wall too.
Dialogue#BOTTOM=[Starting up]  No assure you; the wall is down that
Dialogue#BOTTOM=parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the
Dialogue#BOTTOM=epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two
Dialogue#BOTTOM=of our company?
Dialogue#THESEUS=No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no
Dialogue#THESEUS=excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all
Dialogue#THESEUS=dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he
Dialogue#THESEUS=that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself
Dialogue#THESEUS=in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine
Dialogue#THESEUS=tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably
Dialogue#THESEUS=discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
Dialogue#THESEUS=epilogue alone.

Dialogue#THESEUS=The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:
Dialogue#THESEUS=Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
Dialogue#THESEUS=I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn
Dialogue#THESEUS=As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
Dialogue#THESEUS=This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
