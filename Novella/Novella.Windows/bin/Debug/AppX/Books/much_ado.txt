Banner:SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.
Notice:Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger
Dialogue:LEONATO=I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
Dialogue:LEONATO=comes this night to Messina.
Dialogue:Messenger=He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off
Dialogue:Messenger=when I left him.
Dialogue:LEONATO=How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
Dialogue:Messenger=But few of any sort, and none of name.
Dialogue:LEONATO=A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
Dialogue:LEONATO=home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
Dialogue:LEONATO=bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.
Dialogue:Messenger=Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
Dialogue:Messenger=Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
Dialogue:Messenger=promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,
Dialogue:Messenger=the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better
Dialogue:Messenger=bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
Dialogue:Messenger=tell you how.
Dialogue:LEONATO=He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
Dialogue:LEONATO=glad of it.
Dialogue:Messenger=I have already delivered him letters, and there
Dialogue:Messenger=appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could
Dialogue:Messenger=not show itself modest enough without a badge of
Dialogue:Messenger=bitterness.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Did he break out into tears?
Dialogue:Messenger=In great measure.
Dialogue:LEONATO=A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
Dialogue:LEONATO=truer than those that are so washed. How much
Dialogue:LEONATO=better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
Dialogue:BEATRICE=I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the
Dialogue:BEATRICE=wars or no?
Dialogue:Messenger=I know none of that name, lady: there was none such
Dialogue:Messenger=in the army of any sort.
Dialogue:LEONATO=What is he that you ask for, niece?
Dialogue:HERO=My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
Dialogue:Messenger=O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading
Dialogue:BEATRICE=the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged
Dialogue:BEATRICE=him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
Dialogue:BEATRICE=killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
Dialogue:BEATRICE=he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;
Dialogue:LEONATO=but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.
Dialogue:Messenger=He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:
Dialogue:BEATRICE=he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an
Dialogue:BEATRICE=excellent stomach.
Dialogue:Messenger=And a good soldier too, lady.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?
Dialogue:Messenger=A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all
Dialogue:Messenger=honourable virtues.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:
Dialogue:BEATRICE=but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.
Dialogue:LEONATO=You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a
Dialogue:LEONATO=kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
Dialogue:LEONATO=they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
Dialogue:LEONATO=between them.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
Dialogue:BEATRICE=conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
Dialogue:BEATRICE=now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
Dialogue:BEATRICE=he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
Dialogue:BEATRICE=bear it for a difference between himself and his
Dialogue:BEATRICE=horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
Dialogue:BEATRICE=to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
Dialogue:BEATRICE=companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
Dialogue:Messenger=Is't possible?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
Dialogue:BEATRICE=the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the
Dialogue:BEATRICE=next block.
Dialogue:Messenger=I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray
Dialogue:BEATRICE=you, who is his companion? Is there no young
Dialogue:BEATRICE=squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
Dialogue:Messenger=He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he
Dialogue:BEATRICE=is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker
Dialogue:BEATRICE=runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
Dialogue:BEATRICE=he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a
Dialogue:BEATRICE=thousand pound ere a' be cured.
Dialogue:Messenger=I will hold friends with you, lady.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Do, good friend.
Dialogue:LEONATO=You will never run mad, niece.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=No, not till a hot January.
Dialogue:Messenger=Don Pedro is approached.
Notice:Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=cost, and you encounter it.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
Dialogue:LEONATO=your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
Dialogue:LEONATO=remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides
Dialogue:LEONATO=and happiness takes his leave.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=is your daughter.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Her mother hath many times told me so.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
Dialogue:LEONATO=Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=honourable father.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
Dialogue:BENEDICK=have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as
Dialogue:BENEDICK=like him as she is.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Benedick: nobody marks you.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
Dialogue:BEATRICE=such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come
Dialogue:BEATRICE=in her presence.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I
Dialogue:BENEDICK=am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I
Dialogue:BENEDICK=would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
Dialogue:BENEDICK=heart; for, truly, I love none.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=A dear happiness to women: they would else have
Dialogue:BEATRICE=been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
Dialogue:BEATRICE=and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I
Dialogue:BEATRICE=had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
Dialogue:BEATRICE=swear he loves me.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some
Dialogue:BENEDICK=gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate
Dialogue:BENEDICK=scratched face.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
Dialogue:BEATRICE=a face as yours were.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and
Dialogue:BENEDICK=so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's
Dialogue:BENEDICK=name; I have done.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=the least a month; and he heartily prays some
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=hypocrite, but prays from his heart.
Dialogue:LEONATO=If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.
Notice:To DON JOHN
Dialogue:LEONATO=Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to
Dialogue:LEONATO=the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank
Dialogue:DON JOHN=you.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Please it your grace lead on?
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.
Notice:Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I noted her not; but I looked on her.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Is she not a modest young lady?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for
Dialogue:BENEDICK=my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak
Dialogue:BENEDICK=after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high
Dialogue:BENEDICK=praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little
Dialogue:BENEDICK=for a great praise: only this commendation I can
Dialogue:BENEDICK=afford her, that were she other than she is, she
Dialogue:BENEDICK=were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I
Dialogue:BENEDICK=do not like her.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=truly how thou likest her.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Can the world buy such a jewel?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this
Dialogue:BENEDICK=with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a
Dialogue:BENEDICK=rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take
Dialogue:BENEDICK=you, to go in the song?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=looked on.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
Dialogue:BENEDICK=matter: there's her cousin, an she were not
Dialogue:BENEDICK=possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty
Dialogue:BENEDICK=as the first of May doth the last of December. But I
Dialogue:BENEDICK=hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world
Dialogue:BENEDICK=one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
Dialogue:BENEDICK=into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
Notice:Re-enter DON PEDRO
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=What secret hath held you here, that you followed
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=not to Leonato's?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I would your grace would constrain me to tell.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=I charge thee on thy allegiance.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb
Dialogue:BENEDICK=man; I would have you think so; but, on my
Dialogue:BENEDICK=allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is
Dialogue:BENEDICK=in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's
Dialogue:BENEDICK=short daughter.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=If this were so, so were it uttered.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor
Dialogue:BENEDICK='twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be
Dialogue:BENEDICK=so.'
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=should be otherwise.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=By my troth, I speak my thought.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=That I love her, I feel.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=That she is worthy, I know.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=That I neither feel how she should be loved nor
Dialogue:BENEDICK=know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that
Dialogue:BENEDICK=fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=of beauty.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And never could maintain his part but in the force
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=of his will.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she
Dialogue:BENEDICK=brought me up, I likewise give her most humble
Dialogue:BENEDICK=thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my
Dialogue:BENEDICK=forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do
Dialogue:BENEDICK=them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the
Dialogue:BENEDICK=right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood
Dialogue:BENEDICK=with love than I will get again with drinking, pick
Dialogue:BENEDICK=out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me
Dialogue:BENEDICK=up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of
Dialogue:BENEDICK=blind Cupid.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=wilt prove a notable argument.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
Dialogue:BENEDICK=at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on
Dialogue:BENEDICK=the shoulder, and called Adam.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=doth bear the yoke.'
Dialogue:BENEDICK=The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set
Dialogue:BENEDICK=them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=and in such great letters as they write 'Here is
Dialogue:BENEDICK=good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign
Dialogue:BENEDICK='Here you may see Benedick the married man.'
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I look for an earthquake too, then.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Well, you temporize with the hours. In the
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=great preparation.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I have almost matter enough in me for such an
Dialogue:BENEDICK=embassage; and so I commit you--
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
Dialogue:BENEDICK=discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and
Dialogue:BENEDICK=the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere
Dialogue:BENEDICK=you flout old ends any further, examine your
Dialogue:BENEDICK=conscience: and so I leave you.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=My liege, your highness now may do me good.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=O, my lord,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=When you went onward on this ended action,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Than to drive liking to the name of love:
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Thou wilt be like a lover presently
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And tire the hearer with a book of words.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And I will break with her and with her father,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=How sweetly you do minister to love,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=That know love's grief by his complexion!
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I would have salved it with a longer treatise.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=The fairest grant is the necessity.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And I will fit thee with the remedy.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=I know we shall have revelling to-night:
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=I will assume thy part in some disguise
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And take her hearing prisoner with the force
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Then after to her father will I break;
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=In practise let us put it presently.
Notice:Exeunt
Banner:SCENE II. A room in LEONATO's house.
Notice:Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting
Dialogue:LEONATO=How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?
Dialogue:LEONATO=hath he provided this music?
Dialogue:ANTONIO=He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell
Dialogue:ANTONIO=you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Are they good?
Dialogue:ANTONIO=As the event stamps them: but they have a good
Dialogue:ANTONIO=cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count
Dialogue:ANTONIO=Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine
Dialogue:ANTONIO=orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:
Dialogue:ANTONIO=the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
Dialogue:ANTONIO=niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
Dialogue:ANTONIO=this night in a dance: and if he found her
Dialogue:ANTONIO=accordant, he meant to take the present time by the
Dialogue:ANTONIO=top and instantly break with you of it.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
Dialogue:ANTONIO=A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and
Dialogue:ANTONIO=question him yourself.
Dialogue:LEONATO=No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear
Dialogue:LEONATO=itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,
Dialogue:LEONATO=that she may be the better prepared for an answer,
Dialogue:LEONATO=if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.
Notice:Enter Attendants
Dialogue:LEONATO=Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you
Dialogue:LEONATO=mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your
Dialogue:LEONATO=skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.
Notice:Exeunt
Banner:SCENE III. The same.
Notice:Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE
Dialogue:CONRADE=What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out
Dialogue:CONRADE=of measure sad?
Dialogue:DON JOHN=There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;
Dialogue:DON JOHN=therefore the sadness is without limit.
Dialogue:CONRADE=You should hear reason.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?
Dialogue:CONRADE=If not a present remedy, at least a patient
Dialogue:CONRADE=sufferance.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,
Dialogue:DON JOHN=born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral
Dialogue:DON JOHN=medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide
Dialogue:DON JOHN=what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile
Dialogue:DON JOHN=at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait
Dialogue:DON JOHN=for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and
Dialogue:DON JOHN=tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and
Dialogue:DON JOHN=claw no man in his humour.
Dialogue:CONRADE=Yea, but you must not make the full show of this
Dialogue:CONRADE=till you may do it without controlment. You have of
Dialogue:CONRADE=late stood out against your brother, and he hath
Dialogue:CONRADE=ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is
Dialogue:CONRADE=impossible you should take true root but by the
Dialogue:CONRADE=fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful
Dialogue:CONRADE=that you frame the season for your own harvest.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
Dialogue:DON JOHN=his grace, and it better fits my blood to be
Dialogue:DON JOHN=disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
Dialogue:DON JOHN=love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to
Dialogue:DON JOHN=be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied
Dialogue:DON JOHN=but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with
Dialogue:DON JOHN=a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I
Dialogue:DON JOHN=have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my
Dialogue:DON JOHN=mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do
Dialogue:DON JOHN=my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and
Dialogue:DON JOHN=seek not to alter me.
Dialogue:CONRADE=Can you make no use of your discontent?
Dialogue:DON JOHN=I make all use of it, for I use it only.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Who comes here?
Notice:Enter BORACHIO
Dialogue:DON JOHN=What news, Borachio?
Dialogue:BORACHIO=I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your
Dialogue:BORACHIO=brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I
Dialogue:BORACHIO=can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?
Dialogue:DON JOHN=What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
Dialogue:DON JOHN=unquietness?
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Marry, it is your brother's right hand.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Who? the most exquisite Claudio?
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Even he.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks
Dialogue:DON JOHN=he?
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a
Dialogue:BORACHIO=musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand
Dialogue:BORACHIO=in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the
Dialogue:BORACHIO=arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the
Dialogue:BORACHIO=prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
Dialogue:BORACHIO=obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to
Dialogue:DON JOHN=my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the
Dialogue:DON JOHN=glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I
Dialogue:DON JOHN=bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?
Dialogue:CONRADE=To the death, my lord.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the
Dialogue:DON JOHN=greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of
Dialogue:DON JOHN=my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?
Dialogue:BORACHIO=We'll wait upon your lordship.

Banner:ACT II
Banner:SCENE I. A hall in LEONATO'S house.
Notice:Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others
Dialogue:LEONATO=Was not Count John here at supper?
Dialogue:ANTONIO=I saw him not.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see
Dialogue:BEATRICE=him but I am heart-burned an hour after.
Dialogue:HERO=He is of a very melancholy disposition.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=He were an excellent man that were made just in the
Dialogue:BEATRICE=midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
Dialogue:BEATRICE=like an image and says nothing, and the other too
Dialogue:BEATRICE=like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's
Dialogue:LEONATO=mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior
Dialogue:LEONATO=Benedick's face,--
Dialogue:BEATRICE=With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money
Dialogue:BEATRICE=enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman
Dialogue:BEATRICE=in the world, if a' could get her good-will.
Dialogue:LEONATO=By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a
Dialogue:LEONATO=husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
Dialogue:ANTONIO=In faith, she's too curst.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's
Dialogue:BEATRICE=sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst
Dialogue:BEATRICE=cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.
Dialogue:LEONATO=So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Just, if he send me no husband; for the which
Dialogue:BEATRICE=blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and
Dialogue:BEATRICE=evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
Dialogue:BEATRICE=beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.
Dialogue:LEONATO=You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel
Dialogue:BEATRICE=and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a
Dialogue:BEATRICE=beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no
Dialogue:BEATRICE=beard is less than a man: and he that is more than
Dialogue:BEATRICE=a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a
Dialogue:BEATRICE=man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take
Dialogue:BEATRICE=sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his
Dialogue:BEATRICE=apes into hell.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Well, then, go you into hell?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet
Dialogue:BEATRICE=me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and
Dialogue:BEATRICE=say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to
Dialogue:BEATRICE=heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver
Dialogue:BEATRICE=I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the
Dialogue:BEATRICE=heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and
Dialogue:BEATRICE=there live we as merry as the day is long.
Dialogue:ANTONIO=[To HERO]  Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled
Dialogue:ANTONIO=by your father.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy
Dialogue:BEATRICE=and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all
Dialogue:BEATRICE=that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else
Dialogue:BEATRICE=make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please
Dialogue:BEATRICE=me.'
Dialogue:LEONATO=Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Not till God make men of some other metal than
Dialogue:BEATRICE=earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
Dialogue:BEATRICE=overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make
Dialogue:BEATRICE=an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;
Dialogue:BEATRICE=and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince
Dialogue:LEONATO=do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be
Dialogue:BEATRICE=not wooed in good time: if the prince be too
Dialogue:BEATRICE=important, tell him there is measure in every thing
Dialogue:BEATRICE=and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:
Dialogue:BEATRICE=wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,
Dialogue:BEATRICE=a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot
Dialogue:BEATRICE=and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
Dialogue:BEATRICE=fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a
Dialogue:BEATRICE=measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes
Dialogue:BEATRICE=repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the
Dialogue:BEATRICE=cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.
Dialogue:LEONATO=The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.

Dialogue:HERO=I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=With me in your company?
Dialogue:HERO=I may say so, when I please.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And when please you to say so?
Dialogue:HERO=When I like your favour; for God defend the lute
Dialogue:HERO=should be like the case!
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.
Dialogue:HERO=Why, then, your visor should be thatched.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Speak low, if you speak love.
Notice:Drawing her aside
Dialogue:BALTHASAR=Well, I would you did like me.

Dialogue:BALTHASAR=Which is one?
Dialogue:MARGARET=I say my prayers aloud.
Dialogue:BALTHASAR=I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.
Dialogue:MARGARET=God match me with a good dancer!
Dialogue:BALTHASAR=Amen.

Dialogue:ANTONIO=At a word, I am not.
Dialogue:URSULA=I know you by the waggling of your head.
Dialogue:ANTONIO=To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
Dialogue:URSULA=You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were
Dialogue:URSULA=the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you
Dialogue:URSULA=are he, you are he.
Dialogue:ANTONIO=At a word, I am not.
Dialogue:URSULA=Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your
Dialogue:URSULA=excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,
Dialogue:URSULA=mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an
Dialogue:URSULA=end.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Will you not tell me who told you so?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=No, you shall pardon me.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Nor will you not tell me who you are?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Not now.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit
Dialogue:BEATRICE=out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Signior Benedick that said so.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=What's he?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=I am sure you know him well enough.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Not I, believe me.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Did he never make you laugh?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I pray you, what is he?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;
Dialogue:BEATRICE=only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:
Dialogue:BEATRICE=none but libertines delight in him; and the
Dialogue:BEATRICE=commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;
Dialogue:BEATRICE=for he both pleases men and angers them, and then
Dialogue:BEATRICE=they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in
Dialogue:BEATRICE=the fleet: I would he had boarded me.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;
Dialogue:BEATRICE=which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,
Dialogue:BEATRICE=strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a
Dialogue:BEATRICE=partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no

Dialogue:BORACHIO=And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Are not you Signior Benedick?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=You know me well; I am he.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:
Dialogue:DON JOHN=he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him
Dialogue:DON JOHN=from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may
Dialogue:DON JOHN=do the part of an honest man in it.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=How know you he loves her?
Dialogue:DON JOHN=I heard him swear his affection.
Dialogue:BORACHIO=So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Come, let us to the banquet.
Notice:Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO

Dialogue:CLAUDIO=But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO='Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Friendship is constant in all other things
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Save in the office and affairs of love:
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Let every eye negotiate for itself
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.

Dialogue:BENEDICK=Come, will you go with me?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Whither?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Even to the next willow, about your own business,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under
Dialogue:BENEDICK=your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear
Dialogue:BENEDICK=it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I wish him joy of her.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they
Dialogue:BENEDICK=sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
Dialogue:BENEDICK=have served you thus?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I pray you, leave me.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the
Dialogue:BENEDICK=boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=If it will not be, I'll leave you.

Dialogue:BENEDICK=Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not
Dialogue:BENEDICK=know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go
Dialogue:BENEDICK=under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I
Dialogue:BENEDICK=am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it
Dialogue:BENEDICK=is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice
Dialogue:BENEDICK=that puts the world into her person and so gives me
Dialogue:BENEDICK=out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.
Notice:Re-enter DON PEDRO
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
Dialogue:BENEDICK=warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=that your grace had got the good will of this young
Dialogue:BENEDICK=lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or
Dialogue:BENEDICK=to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=To be whipped! What's his fault?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being
Dialogue:BENEDICK=overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his
Dialogue:BENEDICK=companion, and he steals it.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=transgression is in the stealer.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=and the garland too; for the garland he might have
Dialogue:BENEDICK=worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on
Dialogue:BENEDICK=you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=the owner.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=you say honestly.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=wronged by you.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!
Dialogue:BENEDICK=an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
Dialogue:BENEDICK=answered her; my very visor began to assume life and
Dialogue:BENEDICK=scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
Dialogue:BENEDICK=myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was
Dialogue:BENEDICK=duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest
Dialogue:BENEDICK=with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
Dialogue:BENEDICK=like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
Dialogue:BENEDICK=me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
Dialogue:BENEDICK=if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=there were no living near her; she would infect to
Dialogue:BENEDICK=the north star. I would not marry her, though she
Dialogue:BENEDICK=were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
Dialogue:BENEDICK=he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
Dialogue:BENEDICK=turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
Dialogue:BENEDICK=the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find
Dialogue:BENEDICK=her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
Dialogue:BENEDICK=some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while
Dialogue:BENEDICK=she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
Dialogue:BENEDICK=sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they
Dialogue:BENEDICK=would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror

Dialogue:BENEDICK=Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=rather than hold three words' conference with this

Dialogue:BENEDICK=O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot
Dialogue:BENEDICK=endure my Lady Tongue.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Signior Benedick.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave
Dialogue:BEATRICE=him use for it, a double heart for his single one:
Dialogue:BEATRICE=marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,
Dialogue:BEATRICE=therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I
Dialogue:BEATRICE=should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Not sad, my lord.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=How then? sick?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Neither, my lord.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor
Dialogue:BEATRICE=well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and
Dialogue:BEATRICE=something of that jealous complexion.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=and his good will obtained: name the day of
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=marriage, and God give thee joy!
Dialogue:LEONATO=Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my
Dialogue:LEONATO=fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
Dialogue:LEONATO=grace say Amen to it.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Speak, count, 'tis your cue.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=you and dote upon the exchange.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth
Dialogue:BEATRICE=with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on
Dialogue:BEATRICE=the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his
Dialogue:BEATRICE=ear that he is in her heart.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And so she doth, cousin.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the
Dialogue:BEATRICE=world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a
Dialogue:BEATRICE=corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=I would rather have one of your father's getting.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
Dialogue:BEATRICE=father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Will you have me, lady?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=No, my lord, unless I might have another for
Dialogue:BEATRICE=working-days: your grace is too costly to wear
Dialogue:BEATRICE=every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I
Dialogue:BEATRICE=was born to speak all mirth and no matter.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=a merry hour.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there
Dialogue:BEATRICE=was a star danced, and under that was I born.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Cousins, God give you joy!
Dialogue:LEONATO=Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
Dialogue:LEONATO=There's little of the melancholy element in her, my
Dialogue:LEONATO=lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and
Dialogue:LEONATO=not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,
Dialogue:LEONATO=she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
Dialogue:LEONATO=herself with laughing.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
Dialogue:LEONATO=O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=She were an excellent wife for Benedict.
Dialogue:LEONATO=O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,
Dialogue:LEONATO=they would talk themselves mad.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=have all his rites.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just
Dialogue:LEONATO=seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all
Dialogue:LEONATO=things answer my mind.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=affection the one with the other. I would fain have
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=you three will but minister such assistance as I
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=shall give you direction.
Dialogue:LEONATO=My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten
Dialogue:LEONATO=nights' watchings.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And I, my lord.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And you too, gentle Hero?
Dialogue:HERO=I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my
Dialogue:HERO=cousin to a good husband.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Cupid is no longer an archer: hi s glory shall be
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,

Dialogue:DON JOHN=daughter of Leonato.
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be
Dialogue:DON JOHN=medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,
Dialogue:DON JOHN=and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
Dialogue:DON JOHN=evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no
Dialogue:BORACHIO=dishonesty shall appear in me.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Show me briefly how.
Dialogue:BORACHIO=I think I told your lordship a year since, how much
Dialogue:BORACHIO=I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting
Dialogue:BORACHIO=gentlewoman to Hero.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=I remember.
Dialogue:BORACHIO=I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,
Dialogue:BORACHIO=appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?
Dialogue:BORACHIO=The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to
Dialogue:BORACHIO=the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that
Dialogue:BORACHIO=he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold
Dialogue:BORACHIO=up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=What proof shall I make of that?
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,
Dialogue:BORACHIO=to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any
Dialogue:BORACHIO=other issue?
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and
Dialogue:BORACHIO=the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know
Dialogue:BORACHIO=that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the
Dialogue:BORACHIO=prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's
Dialogue:BORACHIO=honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
Dialogue:BORACHIO=reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the
Dialogue:BORACHIO=semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered
Dialogue:BORACHIO=thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:
Dialogue:BORACHIO=offer them instances; which shall bear no less
Dialogue:BORACHIO=likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,
Dialogue:BORACHIO=hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night
Dialogue:BORACHIO=before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I
Dialogue:BORACHIO=will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
Dialogue:BORACHIO=absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth
Dialogue:BORACHIO=of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
Dialogue:BORACHIO=assurance and all the preparation overthrown.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put
Dialogue:DON JOHN=it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and

Dialogue:BENEDICK=I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much
Dialogue:BENEDICK=another man is a fool when he dedicates his

Dialogue:BENEDICK=of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
Dialogue:BENEDICK=is Claudio. I have known when there was no music
Dialogue:BENEDICK=with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he
Dialogue:BENEDICK=rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known
Dialogue:BENEDICK=when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
Dialogue:BENEDICK=good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to
Dialogue:BENEDICK=speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man
Dialogue:BENEDICK=and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his
Dialogue:BENEDICK=words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many
Dialogue:BENEDICK=strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
Dialogue:BENEDICK=these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
Dialogue:BENEDICK=be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster
Dialogue:BENEDICK=of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman
Dialogue:BENEDICK=is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am
Dialogue:BENEDICK=well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all
Dialogue:BENEDICK=graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in

Dialogue:CLAUDIO=never think that lady would have loved any man.
Dialogue:LEONATO=No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she
Dialogue:LEONATO=should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in
Dialogue:LEONATO=all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?
Dialogue:LEONATO=By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think
Dialogue:LEONATO=of it but that she loves him with an enraged
Dialogue:LEONATO=affection: it is past the infinite of thought.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=May be she doth but counterfeit.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Faith, like enough.
Dialogue:LEONATO=O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of
Dialogue:LEONATO=passion came so near the life of passion as she
Dialogue:LEONATO=discovers it.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Why, what effects of passion shows she?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.
Dialogue:LEONATO=What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard
Dialogue:LEONATO=my daughter tell you how.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=She did, indeed.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=thought her spirit had been invincible against all
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=assaults of affection.
Dialogue:LEONATO=I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially
Dialogue:LEONATO=against Benedick.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I should think this a gull, but that the
Dialogue:BENEDICK=white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=sure, hide himself in such reverence.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?
Dialogue:LEONATO=No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO='Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=with scorn, write to him that I love him?'
Dialogue:LEONATO=This says she now when she is beginning to write to
Dialogue:LEONATO=him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and
Dialogue:LEONATO=there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
Dialogue:LEONATO=sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=pretty jest your daughter told us of.
Dialogue:LEONATO=O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she
Dialogue:LEONATO=found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=That.
Dialogue:LEONATO=O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;
Dialogue:LEONATO=railed at herself, that she should be so immodest
Dialogue:LEONATO=to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I
Dialogue:LEONATO=measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I
Dialogue:LEONATO=should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I
Dialogue:LEONATO=love him, I should.'
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'
Dialogue:LEONATO=She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the
Dialogue:LEONATO=ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
Dialogue:LEONATO=is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
Dialogue:LEONATO=to herself: it is very true.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=other, if she will not discover it.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=To what end? He would make but a sport of it and
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=torment the poor lady worse.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=she is virtuous.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And she is exceeding wise.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=In every thing but in loving Benedick.
Dialogue:LEONATO=O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender
Dialogue:LEONATO=a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
Dialogue:LEONATO=the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just
Dialogue:LEONATO=cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=have daffed all other respects and made her half
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=what a' will say.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Were it good, think you?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=her, rather than she will bate one breath of her
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=accustomed crossness.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=She doth well: if she should make tender of her
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=He is a very proper man.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And I take him to be valiant.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=them with a most Christian-like fear.
Dialogue:LEONATO=If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:
Dialogue:LEONATO=if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a
Dialogue:LEONATO=quarrel with fear and trembling.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=good counsel.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=how much he is unworthy so good a lady.
Dialogue:LEONATO=My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=trust my expectation.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Let there be the same net spread for her; and that
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=scene that I would see, which will be merely a
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.
Notice:Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO
Dialogue:BENEDICK=[Coming forward]  This can be no trick: the
Dialogue:BENEDICK=conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
Dialogue:BENEDICK=this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
Dialogue:BENEDICK=seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
Dialogue:BENEDICK=why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:
Dialogue:BENEDICK=they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
Dialogue:BENEDICK=the love come from her; they say too that she will
Dialogue:BENEDICK=rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
Dialogue:BENEDICK=never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
Dialogue:BENEDICK=are they that hear their detractions and can put
Dialogue:BENEDICK=them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a
Dialogue:BENEDICK=truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis
Dialogue:BENEDICK=so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
Dialogue:BENEDICK=me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
Dialogue:BENEDICK=no great argument of her folly, for I will be
Dialogue:BENEDICK=horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
Dialogue:BENEDICK=odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=because I have railed so long against marriage: but
Dialogue:BENEDICK=doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
Dialogue:BENEDICK=in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
Dialogue:BENEDICK=the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would
Dialogue:BENEDICK=die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I
Dialogue:BENEDICK=were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!
Dialogue:BENEDICK=she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
Dialogue:BENEDICK=her.
Notice:Enter BEATRICE
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=I took no more pains for those thanks than you take
Dialogue:BEATRICE=pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would
Dialogue:BEATRICE=not have come.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=You take pleasure then in the message?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's
Dialogue:BEATRICE=point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,
Dialogue:BEATRICE=signior: fare you well.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in
Dialogue:BENEDICK=to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took
Dialogue:BENEDICK=no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
Dialogue:BENEDICK=to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains
Dialogue:BENEDICK=that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do
Dialogue:BENEDICK=not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not
Dialogue:BENEDICK=love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.

Notice:Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA
Dialogue:HERO=Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;
Dialogue:HERO=There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
Dialogue:HERO=Proposing with the prince and Claudio:
Dialogue:HERO=Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula
Dialogue:HERO=Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
Dialogue:HERO=Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;
Dialogue:HERO=And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
Dialogue:HERO=Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,
Dialogue:HERO=Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,
Dialogue:HERO=Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
Dialogue:HERO=Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,
Dialogue:HERO=To listen our purpose.  This is thy office;
Dialogue:HERO=Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.
Dialogue:MARGARET=I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:HERO=Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
Dialogue:HERO=As we do trace this alley up and down,
Dialogue:HERO=Our talk must only be of Benedick.
Dialogue:HERO=When I do name him, let it be thy part
Dialogue:HERO=To praise him more than ever man did merit:
Dialogue:HERO=My talk to thee must be how Benedick
Dialogue:HERO=Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
Dialogue:HERO=Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,
Dialogue:HERO=That only wounds by hearsay.
Notice:Enter BEATRICE, behind
Dialogue:HERO=Now begin;
Dialogue:HERO=For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs
Dialogue:HERO=Close by the ground, to hear our conference.
Dialogue:URSULA=The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
Dialogue:URSULA=Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
Dialogue:URSULA=And greedily devour the treacherous bait:
Dialogue:URSULA=So angle we for Beatrice; who even now
Dialogue:URSULA=Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
Dialogue:URSULA=Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
Dialogue:HERO=Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
Dialogue:HERO=Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
Notice:Approaching the bower
Dialogue:HERO=No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;
Dialogue:HERO=I know her spirits are as coy and wild
Dialogue:HERO=As haggerds of the rock.
Dialogue:URSULA=But are you sure
Dialogue:URSULA=That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
Dialogue:HERO=So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.
Dialogue:URSULA=And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
Dialogue:HERO=They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;
Dialogue:HERO=But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,
Dialogue:HERO=To wish him wrestle with affection,
Dialogue:HERO=And never to let Beatrice know of it.
Dialogue:URSULA=Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
Dialogue:URSULA=Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
Dialogue:URSULA=As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
Dialogue:HERO=O god of love! I know he doth deserve
Dialogue:HERO=As much as may be yielded to a man:
Dialogue:HERO=But Nature never framed a woman's heart
Dialogue:HERO=Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
Dialogue:HERO=Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
Dialogue:HERO=Misprising what they look on, and her wit
Dialogue:HERO=Values itself so highly that to her
Dialogue:HERO=All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,
Dialogue:HERO=Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
Dialogue:HERO=She is so self-endeared.
Dialogue:URSULA=Sure, I think so;
Dialogue:URSULA=And therefore certainly it were not good
Dialogue:URSULA=She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
Dialogue:HERO=Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
Dialogue:HERO=How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
Dialogue:HERO=But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,
Dialogue:HERO=She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
Dialogue:HERO=If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,
Dialogue:HERO=Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
Dialogue:HERO=If low, an agate very vilely cut;
Dialogue:HERO=If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
Dialogue:HERO=If silent, why, a block moved with none.
Dialogue:HERO=So turns she every man the wrong side out
Dialogue:HERO=And never gives to truth and virtue that
Dialogue:HERO=Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
Dialogue:URSULA=Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
Dialogue:HERO=No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
Dialogue:HERO=As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:
Dialogue:HERO=But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
Dialogue:HERO=She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
Dialogue:HERO=Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
Dialogue:HERO=Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
Dialogue:HERO=Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
Dialogue:HERO=It were a better death than die with mocks,
Dialogue:HERO=Which is as bad as die with tickling.
Dialogue:URSULA=Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.
Dialogue:HERO=No; rather I will go to Benedick
Dialogue:HERO=And counsel him to fight against his passion.
Dialogue:HERO=And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
Dialogue:HERO=To stain my cousin with: one doth not know
Dialogue:HERO=How much an ill word may empoison liking.
Dialogue:URSULA=O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.
Dialogue:URSULA=She cannot be so much without true judgment--
Dialogue:URSULA=Having so swift and excellent a wit
Dialogue:URSULA=As she is prized to have--as to refuse
Dialogue:URSULA=So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
Dialogue:HERO=He is the only man of Italy.
Dialogue:HERO=Always excepted my dear Claudio.
Dialogue:URSULA=I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,
Dialogue:URSULA=Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,
Dialogue:URSULA=For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,
Dialogue:URSULA=Goes foremost in report through Italy.
Dialogue:HERO=Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.
Dialogue:URSULA=His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.
Dialogue:URSULA=When are you married, madam?
Dialogue:HERO=Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:
Dialogue:HERO=I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel
Dialogue:HERO=Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.
Dialogue:URSULA=She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.
Dialogue:HERO=If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:
Dialogue:HERO=Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.

Dialogue:BEATRICE=Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!
Dialogue:BEATRICE=No glory lives behind the back of such.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:
Dialogue:BEATRICE=If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee

Notice:Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATO
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=then go I toward Arragon.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=vouchsafe me.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=tongue speaks.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Gallants, I am not as I have been.
Dialogue:LEONATO=So say I	methinks you are sadder.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I hope he be in love.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=he wants money.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I have the toothache.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Draw it.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Hang it!
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=What! sigh for the toothache?
Dialogue:LEONATO=Where is but a humour or a worm.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Well, every one can master a grief but he that has
Dialogue:BENEDICK=it.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Yet say I, he is in love.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=shape of two countries at once, as, a German from
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=If he be not in love with some woman, there is no
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=mornings; what should that bode?
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Hath any man seen him at the barber's?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=stuffed tennis-balls.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=out by that?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And when was he wont to wash his face?
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=what they say of him.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=a lute-string and now governed by stops.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=conclude he is in love.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Nay, but I know who loves him.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=all, dies for him.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=She shall be buried with her face upwards.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old
Dialogue:BENEDICK=signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight
Dialogue:BENEDICK=or nine wise words to speak to you, which these
Dialogue:BENEDICK=hobby-horses must not hear.
Notice:Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.

Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Good den, brother.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=If your leisure served, I would speak with you.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=In private?

Dialogue:DON JOHN=what I would speak of concerns him.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=What's the matter?
Dialogue:DON JOHN=[To CLAUDIO]  Means your lordship to be married
Dialogue:DON JOHN=to-morrow?
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=You know he does.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=I know not that, when he knows what I know.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=You may think I love you not: let that appear
Dialogue:DON JOHN=hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will
Dialogue:DON JOHN=manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you
Dialogue:DON JOHN=well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect
Dialogue:DON JOHN=your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and
Dialogue:DON JOHN=labour ill bestowed.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Why, what's the matter?
Dialogue:DON JOHN=I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances
Dialogue:DON JOHN=shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,
Dialogue:DON JOHN=the lady is disloyal.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Who, Hero?
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Disloyal?
Dialogue:DON JOHN=The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I
Dialogue:DON JOHN=could say she were worse: think you of a worse
Dialogue:DON JOHN=title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till
Dialogue:DON JOHN=further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall
Dialogue:DON JOHN=see her chamber-window entered, even the night
Dialogue:DON JOHN=before her wedding-day: if you love her then,
Dialogue:DON JOHN=to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour
Dialogue:DON JOHN=to change your mind.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=May this be so?
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=I will not think it.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=If you dare not trust that you see, confess not
Dialogue:DON JOHN=that you know: if you will follow me, I will show
Dialogue:DON JOHN=you enough; and when you have seen more and heard
Dialogue:DON JOHN=more, proceed accordingly.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=wed, there will I shame her.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=with thee to disgrace her.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=I will disparage her no farther till you are my

Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=they should have any allegiance in them, being
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=chosen for the prince's watch.
Dialogue:VERGES=Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=First, who think you the most desertless man to be
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=constable?
Dialogue:First Watchman=Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can
Dialogue:First Watchman=write and read.
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.
Dialogue:Second Watchman=Both which, master constable,--
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=let that appear when there is no need of such
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=vanity. You are thought here to be the most
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=senseless and fit man for the constable of the
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.
Dialogue:Second Watchman=How if a' will not stand?
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=presently call the rest of the watch together and
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=thank God you are rid of a knave.
Dialogue:VERGES=If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none
Dialogue:VERGES=of the prince's subjects.
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=True, and they are to meddle with none but the
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
Dialogue:Watchman=We will rather sleep than talk: we know what
Dialogue:Watchman=belongs to a watch.
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=offend: only, have a care that your bills be not
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=stolen. Well, you are to call at all the
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
Dialogue:Watchman=How if they will not?
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=they make you not then the better answer, you may
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=say they are not the men you took them for.
Dialogue:Watchman=Well, sir.
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=of your office, to be no true man; and, for such
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=why the more is for your honesty.
Dialogue:Watchman=If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay
Dialogue:Watchman=hands on him?
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=show himself what he is and steal out of your company.
Dialogue:VERGES=You have been always called a merciful man, partner.
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=a man who hath any honesty in him.
Dialogue:VERGES=If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call
Dialogue:VERGES=to the nurse and bid her still it.
Dialogue:Watchman=How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?

Dialogue:DOGBERRY=her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.
Dialogue:VERGES='Tis very true.
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=to present the prince's own person: if you meet the
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=prince in the night, you may stay him.
Dialogue:VERGES=Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=man against his will.
Dialogue:VERGES=By'r lady, I think it be so.
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Come, neighbour.
Dialogue:Watchman=Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here
Dialogue:Watchman=upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.

Dialogue:BORACHIO=Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a
Dialogue:BORACHIO=scab follow.
Dialogue:CONRADE=I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward
Dialogue:CONRADE=with thy tale.
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for
Dialogue:BORACHIO=it drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,
Dialogue:BORACHIO=utter all to thee.
Dialogue:Watchman=[Aside]  Some treason, masters: yet stand close.
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.
Dialogue:CONRADE=Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
Dialogue:BORACHIO=villany should be so rich; for when rich villains
Dialogue:BORACHIO=have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what
Dialogue:BORACHIO=price they will.
Dialogue:CONRADE=I wonder at it.
Dialogue:BORACHIO=That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that
Dialogue:BORACHIO=the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is
Dialogue:BORACHIO=nothing to a man.
Dialogue:CONRADE=Yes, it is apparel.
Dialogue:BORACHIO=I mean, the fashion.
Dialogue:CONRADE=Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But
Dialogue:BORACHIO=seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
Dialogue:BORACHIO=is?
Dialogue:Watchman=[Aside]  I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile
Dialogue:Watchman=thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a
Dialogue:Watchman=gentleman: I remember his name.
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Didst thou not hear somebody?
Dialogue:CONRADE=No; 'twas the vane on the house.
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this
Dialogue:BORACHIO=fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot
Dialogue:BORACHIO=bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?
Dialogue:BORACHIO=sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
Dialogue:BORACHIO=in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's
Dialogue:BORACHIO=priests in the old church-window, sometime like the
Dialogue:BORACHIO=shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,
Dialogue:BORACHIO=where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?
Dialogue:CONRADE=All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears
Dialogue:CONRADE=out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
Dialogue:CONRADE=thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast
Dialogue:CONRADE=shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night
Dialogue:BORACHIO=wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the
Dialogue:BORACHIO=name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'
Dialogue:BORACHIO=chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good

Dialogue:BORACHIO=tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,
Dialogue:BORACHIO=planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
Dialogue:BORACHIO=John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.
Dialogue:CONRADE=And thought they Margaret was Hero?
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the
Dialogue:BORACHIO=devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly
Dialogue:BORACHIO=by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by
Dialogue:BORACHIO=the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly
Dialogue:BORACHIO=by my villany, which did confirm any slander that
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore
Dialogue:BORACHIO=he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning
Dialogue:BORACHIO=at the temple, and there, before the whole
Dialogue:BORACHIO=congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night
Dialogue:BORACHIO=and send her home again without a husband.
Dialogue:First Watchman=We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!
Dialogue:Second Watchman=Call up the right master constable. We have here
Dialogue:Second Watchman=recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
Dialogue:Second Watchman=ever was known in the commonwealth.
Dialogue:First Watchman=And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'
Dialogue:First Watchman=wears a lock.
Dialogue:CONRADE=Masters, masters,--
Dialogue:Second Watchman=You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.
Dialogue:CONRADE=Masters,--

Dialogue:HERO=none but this.
Dialogue:MARGARET=I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair

Dialogue:MARGARET=gown that they praise so.

Dialogue:MARGARET=By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of
Dialogue:MARGARET=yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with
Dialogue:MARGARET=silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,

Dialogue:HERO=Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?
Dialogue:MARGARET=Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not

Dialogue:MARGARET=honourable without marriage? I think you would have
Dialogue:MARGARET=me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad

Dialogue:MARGARET=nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a

Dialogue:HERO=There thou prickest her with a thistle.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in
Dialogue:BEATRICE=this Benedictus.
Dialogue:MARGARET=Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I

Dialogue:LEONATO=Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Marry, this it is, sir.
Dialogue:VERGES=Yes, in truth it is, sir.
Dialogue:LEONATO=What is it, my good friends?
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.
Dialogue:VERGES=Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living
Dialogue:VERGES=that is an old man and no honester than I.
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Neighbours, you are tedious.
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,

Dialogue:DOGBERRY=us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men

Dialogue:DOGBERRY=are not alike; alas, good neighbour!
Dialogue:LEONATO=Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.

Dialogue:LEONATO=To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.
Dialogue:HERO=I do.
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=If either of you know any inward impediment why you
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=to utter it.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Know you any, Hero?

Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Know you any, count?
Dialogue:LEONATO=I dare make his answer, none.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=do, not knowing what they do!
Dialogue:BENEDICK=How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of

Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Will you with free and unconstrained soul
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Give me this maid, your daughter?
Dialogue:LEONATO=As freely, son, as God did give her me.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And what have I to give you back, whose worth
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Nothing, unless you render her again.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=There, Leonato, take her back again:
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Give not this rotten orange to your friend;
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=O, what authority and show of truth
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Comes not that blood as modest evidence
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=All you that see her, that she were a maid,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=By these exterior shows? But she is none:
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.
Dialogue:LEONATO=What do you mean, my lord?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Not to be married,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
Dialogue:LEONATO=And made defeat of her virginity,--
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I know what you would say: if I have known her,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=You will say she did embrace me as a husband,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=No, Leonato,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I never tempted her with word too large;
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Bashful sincerity and comely love.
Dialogue:HERO=And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=But you are more intemperate in your blood
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=That rage in savage sensuality.
Dialogue:HERO=Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?
Dialogue:LEONATO=Sweet prince, why speak not you?
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=What should I speak?
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=To link my dear friend to a common stale.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=This looks not like a nuptial.
Dialogue:HERO=True! O God!
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Leonato, stand I here?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?
Dialogue:LEONATO=All this is so: but what of this, my lord?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Let me but move one question to your daughter;
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And, by that fatherly and kindly power
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=That you have in her, bid her answer truly.
Dialogue:LEONATO=I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
Dialogue:HERO=O, God defend me! how am I beset!
Dialogue:HERO=What kind of catechising call you this?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=To make you answer truly to your name.
Dialogue:HERO=Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
Dialogue:HERO=With any just reproach?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Marry, that can Hero;
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.
Dialogue:HERO=I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Myself, my brother and this grieved count
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=A thousand times in secret.
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Not to be spoke of;
Dialogue:DON JOHN=There is not chastity enough in language
Dialogue:DON JOHN=Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,
Dialogue:DON JOHN=I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=If half thy outward graces had been placed
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Thou pure impiety and impious purity!
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,

Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And never shall it more be gracious.

Dialogue:LEONATO=O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Death is the fairest cover for her shame
Dialogue:LEONATO=That may be wish'd for.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=How now, cousin Hero!
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Have comfort, lady.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Dost thou look up?
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Yea, wherefore should she not?
Dialogue:LEONATO=Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing
Dialogue:LEONATO=Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
Dialogue:LEONATO=The story that is printed in her blood?
Dialogue:LEONATO=Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:
Dialogue:LEONATO=For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?
Dialogue:LEONATO=Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
Dialogue:LEONATO=O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
Dialogue:LEONATO=Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
Dialogue:LEONATO=Why had I not with charitable hand
Dialogue:LEONATO=Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,
Dialogue:LEONATO=I might have said 'No part of it is mine;
Dialogue:LEONATO=This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
Dialogue:LEONATO=But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
Dialogue:LEONATO=And mine that I was proud on, mine so much
Dialogue:LEONATO=That I myself was to myself not mine,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen
Dialogue:LEONATO=Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
Dialogue:LEONATO=Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
Dialogue:LEONATO=And salt too little which may season give
Dialogue:LEONATO=To her foul-tainted flesh!
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Sir, sir, be patient.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=For my part, I am so attired in wonder,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I know not what to say.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=No, truly not; although, until last night,
Dialogue:BEATRICE=I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made
Dialogue:LEONATO=Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!
Dialogue:LEONATO=Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Hear me a little;
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=For I have only been silent so long
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=And given way unto this course of fortune.
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=...
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=By noting of the lady I have mark'd
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=A thousand blushing apparitions
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=To burn the errors that these princes hold
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Trust not my reading nor my observations,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Which with experimental seal doth warrant
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=The tenor of my book; trust not my age,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Under some biting error.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Friar, it cannot be.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
Dialogue:LEONATO=Is that she will not add to her damnation
Dialogue:LEONATO=A sin of perjury; she not denies it:
Dialogue:LEONATO=Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
Dialogue:LEONATO=That which appears in proper nakedness?
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Lady, what man is he you are accused of?
Dialogue:HERO=They know that do accuse me; I know none:
Dialogue:HERO=If I know more of any man alive
Dialogue:HERO=Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,
Dialogue:HERO=Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,
Dialogue:HERO=Prove you that any man with me conversed
Dialogue:HERO=At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
Dialogue:HERO=Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
Dialogue:HERO=Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=There is some strange misprision in the princes.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Two of them have the very bent of honour;
Dialogue:BENEDICK=And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=The practise of it lives in John the bastard,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.
Dialogue:LEONATO=I know not. If they speak but truth of her,
Dialogue:LEONATO=These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,
Dialogue:LEONATO=The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Nor age so eat up my invention,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
Dialogue:LEONATO=But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Ability in means and choice of friends,
Dialogue:LEONATO=To quit me of them throughly.
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Pause awhile,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=And let my counsel sway you in this case.
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Your daughter here the princes left for dead:
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=And publish it that she is dead indeed;
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Maintain a mourning ostentation
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=And on your family's old monument
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=That appertain unto a burial.
Dialogue:LEONATO=What shall become of this? what will this do?
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=But not for that dream I on this strange course,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=But on this travail look for greater birth.
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Upon the instant that she was accused,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Shall be lamented, pitied and excused
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Of every hearer: for it so falls out
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=That what we have we prize not to the worth
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Why, then we rack the value, then we find
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=The virtue that possession would not show us
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=When he shall hear she died upon his words,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Into his study of imagination,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=And every lovely organ of her life
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=More moving-delicate and full of life,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=If ever love had interest in his liver,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=And wish he had not so accused her,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=No, though he thought his accusation true.
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Let this be so, and doubt not but success
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Will fashion the event in better shape
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=The supposition of the lady's death
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=As best befits her wounded reputation,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=In some reclusive and religious life,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:
Dialogue:BENEDICK=And though you know my inwardness and love
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
Dialogue:BENEDICK=As secretly and justly as your soul
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Should with your body.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Being that I flow in grief,
Dialogue:LEONATO=The smallest twine may lead me.

Dialogue:BENEDICK=Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I will not desire that.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=You have no reason; I do it freely.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Is there any way to show such friendship?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=A very even way, but no such friend.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=May a man do it?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=It is a man's office, but not yours.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is
Dialogue:BENEDICK=not that strange?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=As strange as the thing I know not. It were as
Dialogue:BEATRICE=possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as
Dialogue:BEATRICE=you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I
Dialogue:BEATRICE=confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Do not swear, and eat it.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make
Dialogue:BENEDICK=him eat it that says I love not you.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Will you not eat your word?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I love thee.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Why, then, God forgive me!
Dialogue:BENEDICK=What offence, sweet Beatrice?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to
Dialogue:BEATRICE=protest I loved you.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=And do it with all thy heart.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=I love you with so much of my heart that none is
Dialogue:BEATRICE=left to protest.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Come, bid me do any thing for thee.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Kill Claudio.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Ha! not for the wide world.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=You kill me to deny it. Farewell.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Tarry, sweet Beatrice.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in
Dialogue:BEATRICE=you: nay, I pray you, let me go.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Beatrice,--
Dialogue:BEATRICE=In faith, I will go.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=We'll be friends first.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Is Claudio thine enemy?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Is he not approved in the height a villain, that
Dialogue:BEATRICE=hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
Dialogue:BEATRICE=that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they
Dialogue:BEATRICE=come to take hands; and then, with public
Dialogue:BEATRICE=accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,
Dialogue:BEATRICE=--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart
Dialogue:BEATRICE=in the market-place.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Hear me, Beatrice,--
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Nay, but, Beatrice,--
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Beat--
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,
Dialogue:BEATRICE=a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,
Dialogue:BEATRICE=surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I
Dialogue:BEATRICE=had any friend would be a man for my sake! But
Dialogue:BEATRICE=manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into
Dialogue:BEATRICE=compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and
Dialogue:BEATRICE=trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules
Dialogue:BEATRICE=that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a
Dialogue:BEATRICE=man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will
Dialogue:BENEDICK=kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you
Dialogue:BENEDICK=hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your
Dialogue:BENEDICK=cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.

Dialogue:LEONATO=As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;
Dialogue:LEONATO=Nor let no comforter delight mine ear

Dialogue:CLAUDIO=We had like to have had our two noses snapped off
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=with two old men without teeth.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came
Dialogue:BENEDICK=to seek you both.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=away. Wilt thou use thy wit?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Never any did so, though very many have been beside
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou

Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=What, a feast, a feast?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=a woodcock too?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'
Dialogue:DON PEDRO='Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'
Dialogue:DON PEDRO='Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=wast the properest man in Italy.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=For the which she wept heartily and said she cared
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=not.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=the old man's daughter told us all.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=hid in the garden.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=the sensible Benedick's head?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=married man'?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave
Dialogue:BENEDICK=you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests
Dialogue:BENEDICK=as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank
Dialogue:BENEDICK=you: I must discontinue your company: your brother

Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Hearken after their offence, my lord.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Officers, what offence have these men done?
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Marry, sir, they have committed false report;
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I

Dialogue:BORACHIO=deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms
Dialogue:BORACHIO=could not discover, these shallow fools have brought

Dialogue:BORACHIO=to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into
Dialogue:BORACHIO=the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's

Dialogue:BORACHIO=If you would know your wronger, look on me.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
Dialogue:LEONATO=Mine innocent child?
Dialogue:BORACHIO=Yea, even I alone.
Dialogue:LEONATO=No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:
Dialogue:LEONATO=Here stand a pair of honourable men;
Dialogue:LEONATO=A third is fled, that had a hand in it.
Dialogue:LEONATO=I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:
Dialogue:LEONATO=Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
Dialogue:LEONATO='Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I know not how to pray your patience;
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Impose me to what penance your invention
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=But in mistaking.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=                  By my soul, nor I:
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=And yet, to satisfy this good old man,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=I would bend under any heavy weight
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=That he'll enjoin me to.

Dialogue:LEONATO=To-morrow morning come you to my house,
Dialogue:LEONATO=And since you could not be my son-in-law,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Almost the copy of my child that's dead,
Dialogue:LEONATO=And she alone is heir to both of us:
Dialogue:LEONATO=Give her the right you should have given her cousin,
Dialogue:LEONATO=And so dies my revenge.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=O noble sir,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I do embrace your offer; and dispose
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=For henceforth of poor Claudio.
Dialogue:LEONATO=To-morrow then I will expect your coming;

Dialogue:BORACHIO=In any thing that I do know by her.
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call
Dialogue:DOGBERRY=me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his

Dialogue:DOGBERRY=name, the which he hath used so long and never paid

Dialogue:MARGARET=Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living
Dialogue:BENEDICK=shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou
Dialogue:BENEDICK=deservest it.
Dialogue:MARGARET=To have no man come over me! why, shall I always
Dialogue:MARGARET=keep below stairs?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.
Dialogue:MARGARET=And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,
Dialogue:MARGARET=but hurt not.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a
Dialogue:BENEDICK=woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give
Dialogue:BENEDICK=thee the bucklers.
Dialogue:MARGARET=Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the
Dialogue:BENEDICK=pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.
Dialogue:MARGARET=Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=And therefore will come.

Dialogue:BENEDICK=The god of love,

Dialogue:BENEDICK=I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good
Dialogue:BENEDICK=swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and
Dialogue:BENEDICK=a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
Dialogue:BENEDICK=blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned
Dialogue:BENEDICK=over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I
Dialogue:BENEDICK=cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find
Dialogue:BENEDICK=out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent
Dialogue:BENEDICK=rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,
Dialogue:BENEDICK='school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous
Dialogue:BENEDICK=endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
Notice:Enter BEATRICE
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=O, stay but till then!
Dialogue:BEATRICE='Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere
Dialogue:BEATRICE=I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with
Dialogue:BEATRICE=knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but
Dialogue:BEATRICE=foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I
Dialogue:BEATRICE=will depart unkissed.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee
Dialogue:BENEDICK=plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe
Dialogue:BENEDICK=him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for
Dialogue:BENEDICK=which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=For them all together; which maintained so politic
Dialogue:BEATRICE=a state of evil that they will not admit any good
Dialogue:BEATRICE=part to intermingle with them. But for which of my
Dialogue:BEATRICE=good parts did you first suffer love for me?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love
Dialogue:BENEDICK=indeed, for I love thee against my will.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!
Dialogue:BEATRICE=If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for
Dialogue:BEATRICE=yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=It appears not in this confession: there's not one
Dialogue:BEATRICE=wise man among twenty that will praise himself.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in
Dialogue:BENEDICK=the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect
Dialogue:BENEDICK=in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live
Dialogue:BENEDICK=no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
Dialogue:BENEDICK=widow weeps.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=And how long is that, think you?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in
Dialogue:BENEDICK=rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the
Dialogue:BENEDICK=wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no
Dialogue:BENEDICK=impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his
Dialogue:BENEDICK=own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for
Dialogue:BENEDICK=praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is
Dialogue:BENEDICK=praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Very ill.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=And how do you?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Very ill too.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave
Dialogue:BENEDICK=you too, for here comes one in haste.

Dialogue:URSULA=falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily
Dialogue:URSULA=abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is
Dialogue:URSULA=fed and gone. Will you come presently?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Will you go hear this news, signior?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be

Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Graves, yawn and yield your dead,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Till death be uttered,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Heavily, heavily.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=     Now, unto thy bones good night!
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Yearly will I do this rite.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=     Good morrow, masters: each his several way.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;

Dialogue:LEONATO=But Margaret was in some fault for this,
Dialogue:LEONATO=Although against her will, as it appears
Dialogue:LEONATO=In the true course of all the question.
Dialogue:ANTONIO=Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=And so am I, being else by faith enforced

Dialogue:LEONATO=Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,
Dialogue:LEONATO=And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.

Dialogue:LEONATO=The prince and Claudio promised by this hour

Dialogue:LEONATO=You must be father to your brother's daughter
Dialogue:LEONATO=And give her to young Claudio.
Dialogue:ANTONIO=Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=To do what, signior?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=To bind me, or undo me; one of them.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.
Dialogue:LEONATO=That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=And I do with an eye of love requite her.
Dialogue:LEONATO=The sight whereof I think you had from me,
Dialogue:LEONATO=From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:
Dialogue:BENEDICK=But, for my will, my will is your good will
Dialogue:BENEDICK=May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd
Dialogue:BENEDICK=In the state of honourable marriage:

Dialogue:LEONATO=Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.
Notice:Exit ANTONIO
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=That you have such a February face,
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=When he would play the noble beast in love.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;
Dialogue:BENEDICK=And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,
Dialogue:BENEDICK=And got a calf in that same noble feat
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.

Dialogue:HERO=And surely as I live, I am a maid.
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=The former Hero! Hero that is dead!
Dialogue:LEONATO=She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.

Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=Meantime let wonder seem familiar,
Dialogue:FRIAR FRANCIS=And to the chapel let us presently.

Dialogue:BEATRICE=[Unmasking]  I answer to that name. What is your will?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Do not you love me?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Why, no; no more than reason.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Have been deceived; they swore you did.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Do not you love me?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Troth, no; no more than reason.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
Dialogue:BEATRICE=Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=They swore that you were almost sick for me.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.
Dialogue:BENEDICK='Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?
Dialogue:BEATRICE=No, truly, but in friendly recompense.
Dialogue:LEONATO=Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;

Dialogue:BENEDICK=thee for pity.
Dialogue:BEATRICE=I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield
Dialogue:BEATRICE=upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,
Dialogue:BEATRICE=for I was told you were in a consumption.
Dialogue:BENEDICK=Peace! I will stop your mouth.
Notice:Kissing her
Dialogue:DON PEDRO=How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?
Dialogue:BENEDICK=I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of
Dialogue:BENEDICK=wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost
Dialogue:BENEDICK=thou think I  care for a satire or an epigram? No:
Dialogue:BENEDICK=if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear
Dialogue:BENEDICK=nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do
Dialogue:BENEDICK=purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any
Dialogue:BENEDICK=purpose that the world can say against it; and
Dialogue:BENEDICK=therefore never flout at me for what I have said
Dialogue:BENEDICK=against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my
Dialogue:BENEDICK=conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to
Dialogue:BENEDICK=have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my
Dialogue:BENEDICK=kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of
Dialogue:CLAUDIO=question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look
