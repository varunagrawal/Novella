Dialogue#ALONSO=Play the men.
Dialogue#Boatswain=I pray now, keep below.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Where is the master, boatswain?
Dialogue#Boatswain=Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
Dialogue#Boatswain=cabins: you do assist the storm.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Nay, good, be patient.
Dialogue#Boatswain=When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
Dialogue#Boatswain=for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
Dialogue#Boatswain=None that I more love than myself. You are a
Dialogue#Boatswain=counsellor; if you can command these elements to
Dialogue#Boatswain=silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
Dialogue#Boatswain=not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
Dialogue#Boatswain=cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make

Dialogue#Boatswain=of our way, I say.

Dialogue#GONZALO=I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he

Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=incharitable dog!
Dialogue#Boatswain=Work you then.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
Dialogue#ANTONIO=We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
Dialogue#GONZALO=I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
Dialogue#GONZALO=no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an

Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=I'm out of patience.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:

Dialogue#ANTONIO=The washing of ten tides!

Notice#Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA
Dialogue#MIRANDA=If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
Dialogue#MIRANDA=But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
Dialogue#MIRANDA=With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Had I been any god of power, I would
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
Dialogue#MIRANDA=It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
Dialogue#MIRANDA=The fraughting souls within her.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Be collected:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
Dialogue#PROSPERO=There's no harm done.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=O, woe the day!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=No harm.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And thy no greater father.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=More to know
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Did never meddle with my thoughts.
Dialogue#PROSPERO='Tis time
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
Notice#Lays down his mantle
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The very virtue of compassion in thee,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I have with such provision in mine art
Dialogue#PROSPERO=So safely ordered that there is no soul--
Dialogue#PROSPERO=No, not so much perdition as an hair
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Betid to any creature in the vessel
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=For thou must now know farther.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=You have often
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
Dialogue#MIRANDA=And left me to a bootless inquisition,
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The hour's now come;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A time before we came unto this cell?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Out three years old.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Certainly, sir, I can.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=By what? by any other house or person?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Of any thing the image tell me that
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Hath kept with thy remembrance.
Dialogue#MIRANDA='Tis far off
Dialogue#MIRANDA=And rather like a dream than an assurance
Dialogue#MIRANDA=That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Four or five women once that tended me?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
Dialogue#PROSPERO=That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
Dialogue#PROSPERO=In the dark backward and abysm of time?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=How thou camest here thou mayst.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=But that I do not.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A prince of power.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=                  Sir, are not you my father?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
Dialogue#PROSPERO=She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And princess no worse issued.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=O the heavens!
Dialogue#MIRANDA=What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Or blessed was't we did?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Both, both, my girl:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=But blessedly holp hither.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=O, my heart bleeds
Dialogue#MIRANDA=To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Of all the world I loved and to him put
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The manage of my state; as at that time
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Through all the signories it was the first
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
Dialogue#PROSPERO=In dignity, and for the liberal arts
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Without a parallel; those being all my study,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The government I cast upon my brother
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And to my state grew stranger, being transported
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Dost thou attend me?
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Sir, most heedfully.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Being once perfected how to grant suits,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=How to deny them, who to advance and who
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To trash for over-topping, new created
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=O, good sir, I do.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=                  I pray thee, mark me.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To closeness and the bettering of my mind
Dialogue#PROSPERO=With that which, but by being so retired,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Like a good parent, did beget of him
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A falsehood in its contrary as great
Dialogue#PROSPERO=As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Not only with what my revenue yielded,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=But what my power might else exact, like one
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Who having into truth, by telling of it,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Made such a sinner of his memory,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To credit his own lie, he did believe
Dialogue#PROSPERO=He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And executing the outward face of royalty,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Dost thou hear?
Dialogue#MIRANDA=                  Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To have no screen between this part he play'd
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
Dialogue#PROSPERO=He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
Dialogue#PROSPERO=So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To most ignoble stooping.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=O the heavens!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
Dialogue#PROSPERO=If this might be a brother.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=I should sin
Dialogue#MIRANDA=To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Good wombs have borne bad sons.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Now the condition.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The King of Naples, being an enemy
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Should presently extirpate me and mine
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
Dialogue#PROSPERO=With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A treacherous army levied, one midnight
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Me and thy crying self.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Alack, for pity!
Dialogue#MIRANDA=I, not remembering how I cried out then,
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
Dialogue#MIRANDA=That wrings mine eyes to't.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Hear a little further
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And then I'll bring thee to the present business
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Which now's upon's; without the which this story
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Were most impertinent.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Wherefore did they not
Dialogue#MIRANDA=That hour destroy us?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Well demanded, wench:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A mark so bloody on the business, but
Dialogue#PROSPERO=With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Did us but loving wrong.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Alack, what trouble
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Was I then to you!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=                  O, a cherubim
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
Dialogue#PROSPERO=An undergoing stomach, to bear up
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Against what should ensue.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=How came we ashore?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=By Providence divine.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Some food we had and some fresh water that
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Out of his charity, being then appointed
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Master of this design, did give us, with
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
Dialogue#PROSPERO=From mine own library with volumes that
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I prize above my dukedom.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Would I might
Dialogue#MIRANDA=But ever see that man!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Now I arise:
Notice#Resumes his mantle
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Here in this island we arrived; and here
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Than other princesses can that have more time
Dialogue#PROSPERO=For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
Dialogue#MIRANDA=For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
Dialogue#MIRANDA=For raising this sea-storm?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Know thus far forth.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I find my zenith doth depend upon
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A most auspicious star, whose influence
Dialogue#PROSPERO=If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
Notice#MIRANDA sleeps
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Approach, my Ariel, come.
Notice#Enter ARIEL
Dialogue#ARIEL=All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
Dialogue#ARIEL=To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
Dialogue#ARIEL=To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
Dialogue#ARIEL=On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
Dialogue#ARIEL=Ariel and all his quality.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Hast thou, spirit,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
Dialogue#ARIEL=To every article.
Dialogue#ARIEL=I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
Dialogue#ARIEL=I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
Dialogue#ARIEL=And burn in many places; on the topmast,
Dialogue#ARIEL=The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
Dialogue#ARIEL=O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
Dialogue#ARIEL=And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Dialogue#ARIEL=Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Dialogue#ARIEL=Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Yea, his dread trident shake.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=My brave spirit!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Would not infect his reason?
Dialogue#ARIEL=Not a soul
Dialogue#ARIEL=But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
Dialogue#ARIEL=Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Dialogue#ARIEL=Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
Dialogue#ARIEL=With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
Dialogue#ARIEL=Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty
Dialogue#ARIEL=And all the devils are here.'
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Why that's my spirit!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=But was not this nigh shore?
Dialogue#ARIEL=Close by, my master.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=But are they, Ariel, safe?
Dialogue#ARIEL=Not a hair perish'd;
Dialogue#ARIEL=On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
Dialogue#ARIEL=But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
Dialogue#ARIEL=In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
Dialogue#ARIEL=The king's son have I landed by himself;
Dialogue#ARIEL=Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
Dialogue#ARIEL=In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
Dialogue#ARIEL=His arms in this sad knot.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Of the king's ship
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The mariners say how thou hast disposed
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And all the rest o' the fleet.
Dialogue#ARIEL=Safely in harbour
Dialogue#ARIEL=Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
Dialogue#ARIEL=Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
Dialogue#ARIEL=From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
Dialogue#ARIEL=The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
Dialogue#ARIEL=Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
Dialogue#ARIEL=I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
Dialogue#ARIEL=Which I dispersed, they all have met again
Dialogue#ARIEL=And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Bound sadly home for Naples,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
Dialogue#ARIEL=And his great person perish.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Ariel, thy charge
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=What is the time o' the day?
Dialogue#ARIEL=Past the mid season.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Must by us both be spent most preciously.
Dialogue#ARIEL=Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Which is not yet perform'd me.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=How now? moody?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=What is't thou canst demand?
Dialogue#ARIEL=My liberty.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Before the time be out? no more!
Dialogue#ARIEL=I prithee,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Remember I have done thee worthy service;
Dialogue#ARIEL=Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
Dialogue#ARIEL=Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
Dialogue#ARIEL=To bate me a full year.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Dost thou forget
Dialogue#PROSPERO=From what a torment I did free thee?
Dialogue#ARIEL=No.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Of the salt deep,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To do me business in the veins o' the earth
Dialogue#PROSPERO=When it is baked with frost.
Dialogue#ARIEL=I do not, sir.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?
Dialogue#ARIEL=No, sir.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=     Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.
Dialogue#ARIEL=Sir, in Argier.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=                  O, was she so? I must
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To enter human hearing, from Argier,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
Dialogue#PROSPERO=They would not take her life. Is not this true?
Dialogue#ARIEL=Ay, sir.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=By help of her more potent ministers
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And in her most unmitigable rage,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A dozen years; within which space she died
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
Dialogue#PROSPERO=As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Save for the son that she did litter here,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A human shape.
Dialogue#ARIEL=                  Yes, Caliban her son.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
Dialogue#PROSPERO=What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Could not again undo: it was mine art,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The pine and let thee out.
Dialogue#ARIEL=I thank thee, master.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.
Dialogue#ARIEL=Pardon, master;
Dialogue#ARIEL=I will be correspondent to command
Dialogue#ARIEL=And do my spiriting gently.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Do so, and after two days
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I will discharge thee.
Dialogue#ARIEL=That's my noble master!
Dialogue#ARIEL=What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!
Notice#Exit ARIEL
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!
Dialogue#MIRANDA=     The strangeness of your story put
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Heaviness in me.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=                  Shake it off. Come on;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Yields us kind answer.
Dialogue#MIRANDA='Tis a villain, sir,
Dialogue#MIRANDA=I do not love to look on.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=But, as 'tis,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
Dialogue#PROSPERO=That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou earth, thou! speak.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=[Within]  There's wood enough within.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Come, thou tortoise! when?
Notice#Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,

Dialogue#CALIBAN=With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
Dialogue#CALIBAN=And blister you all o'er!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
Dialogue#PROSPERO=As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Than bees that made 'em.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=I must eat my dinner.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Water with berries in't, and teach me how
Dialogue#CALIBAN=To name the bigger light, and how the less,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
Dialogue#CALIBAN=And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
Dialogue#CALIBAN=For I am all the subjects that you have,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
Dialogue#CALIBAN=In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
Dialogue#CALIBAN=The rest o' the island.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou most lying slave,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
Dialogue#PROSPERO=In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The honour of my child.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
Dialogue#CALIBAN=This isle with Calibans.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Abhorred slave,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
Dialogue#PROSPERO=One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
Dialogue#PROSPERO=With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Though thou didst learn, had that in't which
Dialogue#PROSPERO=good natures
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Deservedly confined into this rock,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=You taught me language; and my profit on't
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
Dialogue#CALIBAN=For learning me your language!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Hag-seed, hence!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
Dialogue#PROSPERO=What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
Dialogue#PROSPERO=That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=No, pray thee.
Notice#Aside
Dialogue#CALIBAN=I must obey: his art is of such power,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=and make a vassal of him.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=So, slave; hence!

Dialogue#PROSPERO=The wild waves whist,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Foot it featly here and there;

Dialogue#PROSPERO=Hark, hark! I hear
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The strain of strutting chanticleer
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
Dialogue#FERDINAND=It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=This music crept by me upon the waters,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Allaying both their fury and my passion
Dialogue#FERDINAND=With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
Dialogue#FERDINAND=No, it begins again.
Notice#ARIEL sings
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Full fathom five thy father lies;
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Of his bones are coral made;
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Nothing of him that doth fade
Dialogue#FERDINAND=But doth suffer a sea-change
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Into something rich and strange.

Dialogue#FERDINAND=The ditty does remember my drown'd father.

Dialogue#FERDINAND=That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And say what thou seest yond.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=What is't? a spirit?
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
Dialogue#MIRANDA=It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
Dialogue#PROSPERO=As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd
Dialogue#PROSPERO=With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And strays about to find 'em.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=I might call him
Dialogue#MIRANDA=A thing divine, for nothing natural
Dialogue#MIRANDA=I ever saw so noble.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=[Aside] It goes on, I see,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Within two days for this.
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Most sure, the goddess
Dialogue#FERDINAND=On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
Dialogue#FERDINAND=May know if you remain upon this island;
Dialogue#FERDINAND=And that you will some good instruction give
Dialogue#FERDINAND=How I may bear me here: my prime request,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
Dialogue#FERDINAND=If you be maid or no?
Dialogue#MIRANDA=No wonder, sir;
Dialogue#MIRANDA=But certainly a maid.
Dialogue#FERDINAND=My language! heavens!
Dialogue#FERDINAND=I am the best of them that speak this speech,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Were I but where 'tis spoken.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=How? the best?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
Dialogue#FERDINAND=A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
Dialogue#FERDINAND=To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
Dialogue#FERDINAND=And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
Dialogue#FERDINAND=The king my father wreck'd.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Alack, for mercy!
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
Dialogue#FERDINAND=And his brave son being twain.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=[Aside]	The Duke of Milan
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And his more braver daughter could control thee,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
Dialogue#PROSPERO=They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I'll set thee free for this.
Notice#To FERDINAND
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A word, good sir;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
Dialogue#MIRANDA=That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
Dialogue#MIRANDA=To be inclined my way!
Dialogue#FERDINAND=O, if a virgin,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
Dialogue#FERDINAND=The queen of Naples.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Soft, sir! one word more.
Notice#Aside
Dialogue#PROSPERO=They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Make the prize light.
Notice#To FERDINAND
Dialogue#PROSPERO=One word more; I charge thee
Dialogue#PROSPERO=That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Upon this island as a spy, to win it
Dialogue#PROSPERO=From me, the lord on't.
Dialogue#FERDINAND=No, as I am a man.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
Dialogue#MIRANDA=If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Good things will strive to dwell with't.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Follow me.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
Dialogue#FERDINAND=No;

Dialogue#FERDINAND=Mine enemy has more power.
Notice#Draws, and is charmed from moving
Dialogue#MIRANDA=O dear father,
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Make not too rash a trial of him, for
Dialogue#MIRANDA=He's gentle and not fearful.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=What? I say,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=For I can here disarm thee with this stick
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And make thy weapon drop.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Beseech you, father.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Hence! hang not on my garments.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Sir, have pity;
Dialogue#MIRANDA=I'll be his surety.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Silence! one word more
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=An advocate for an imposter! hush!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To the most of men this is a Caliban
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And they to him are angels.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=My affections
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Are then most humble; I have no ambition
Dialogue#MIRANDA=To see a goodlier man.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Come on; obey:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thy nerves are in their infancy again
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And have no vigour in them.
Dialogue#FERDINAND=So they are;
Dialogue#FERDINAND=My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
Dialogue#FERDINAND=My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,

Notice#Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others
Dialogue#GONZALO=Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
Dialogue#GONZALO=So have we all, of joy; for our escape
Dialogue#GONZALO=Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Dialogue#GONZALO=Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
Dialogue#GONZALO=The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Dialogue#GONZALO=Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
Dialogue#GONZALO=I mean our preservation, few in millions
Dialogue#GONZALO=Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
Dialogue#GONZALO=Our sorrow with our comfort.
Dialogue#ALONSO=Prithee, peace.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=He receives comfort like cold porridge.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=The visitor will not give him o'er so.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=by and by it will strike.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Sir,--
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=One: tell.
Dialogue#GONZALO=When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
Dialogue#GONZALO=Comes to the entertainer--
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=A dollar.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
Dialogue#GONZALO=have spoken truer than you purposed.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Therefore, my lord,--
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
Dialogue#ALONSO=I prithee, spare.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Well, I have done: but yet,--
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=He will be talking.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
Dialogue#ANTONIO=wager, first begins to crow?
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=The old cock.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=The cockerel.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Done. The wager?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=A laughter.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=A match!
Dialogue#ADRIAN=Though this island seem to be desert,--
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.
Dialogue#ADRIAN=Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Yet,--
Dialogue#ADRIAN=Yet,--
Dialogue#ANTONIO=He could not miss't.
Dialogue#ADRIAN=It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
Dialogue#ADRIAN=temperance.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Temperance was a delicate wench.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.
Dialogue#ADRIAN=The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=As if it had lungs and rotten ones.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Here is everything advantageous to life.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=True; save means to live.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Of that there's none, or little.
Dialogue#GONZALO=How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
Dialogue#ANTONIO=The ground indeed is tawny.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=With an eye of green in't.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=He misses not much.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
Dialogue#GONZALO=But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
Dialogue#GONZALO=beyond credit,--
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=As many vouched rarities are.
Dialogue#GONZALO=That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
Dialogue#GONZALO=the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
Dialogue#GONZALO=glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
Dialogue#GONZALO=salt water.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
Dialogue#ANTONIO=say he lies?
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report
Dialogue#GONZALO=Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
Dialogue#GONZALO=put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
Dialogue#GONZALO=the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN='Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
Dialogue#ADRIAN=Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
Dialogue#ADRIAN=their queen.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Not since widow Dido's time.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=widow Dido!
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=how you take it!
Dialogue#ADRIAN='Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
Dialogue#ADRIAN=she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
Dialogue#GONZALO=This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
Dialogue#ADRIAN=Carthage?
Dialogue#GONZALO=I assure you, Carthage.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=raised the wall and houses too.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=What impossible matter will he make easy next?
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=and give it his son for an apple.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
Dialogue#ANTONIO=forth more islands.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Ay.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Why, in good time.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
Dialogue#GONZALO=as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
Dialogue#GONZALO=of your daughter, who is now queen.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And the rarest that e'er came there.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
Dialogue#GONZALO=wore it? I mean, in a sort.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=That sort was well fished for.
Dialogue#GONZALO=When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
Dialogue#ALONSO=You cram these words into mine ears against
Dialogue#ALONSO=The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Dialogue#ALONSO=Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
Dialogue#ALONSO=My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
Dialogue#ALONSO=Who is so far from Italy removed
Dialogue#ALONSO=I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Dialogue#ALONSO=Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
Dialogue#ALONSO=Hath made his meal on thee?
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=Sir, he may live:
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=I saw him beat the surges under him,
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
Dialogue#FRANCISCO='Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=He came alive to land.
Dialogue#ALONSO=No, no, he's gone.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=But rather lose her to an African;
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
Dialogue#ALONSO=Prithee, peace.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=By all of us, and the fair soul herself
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=son,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=More widows in them of this business' making
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Than we bring men to comfort them:
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=The fault's your own.
Dialogue#ALONSO=So is the dear'st o' the loss.
Dialogue#GONZALO=My lord Sebastian,
Dialogue#GONZALO=The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
Dialogue#GONZALO=And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
Dialogue#GONZALO=When you should bring the plaster.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Very well.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And most chirurgeonly.
Dialogue#GONZALO=It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
Dialogue#GONZALO=When you are cloudy.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Foul weather?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Very foul.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--
Dialogue#ANTONIO=He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Or docks, or mallows.
Dialogue#GONZALO=And were the king on't, what would I do?
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN='Scape being drunk for want of wine.
Dialogue#GONZALO=I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
Dialogue#GONZALO=Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Dialogue#GONZALO=Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Dialogue#GONZALO=Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
Dialogue#GONZALO=And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Dialogue#GONZALO=Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
Dialogue#GONZALO=No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
Dialogue#GONZALO=No occupation; all men idle, all;
Dialogue#GONZALO=And women too, but innocent and pure;
Dialogue#GONZALO=No sovereignty;--
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=                  Yet he would be king on't.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
Dialogue#ANTONIO=beginning.
Dialogue#GONZALO=All things in common nature should produce
Dialogue#GONZALO=Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
Dialogue#GONZALO=Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Dialogue#GONZALO=Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Dialogue#GONZALO=Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
Dialogue#GONZALO=To feed my innocent people.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=No marrying 'mong his subjects?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.
Dialogue#GONZALO=I would with such perfection govern, sir,
Dialogue#GONZALO=To excel the golden age.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=God save his majesty!
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Long live Gonzalo!
Dialogue#GONZALO=                  And,--do you mark me, sir?
Dialogue#ALONSO=Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
Dialogue#GONZALO=I do well believe your highness; and
Dialogue#GONZALO=did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
Dialogue#GONZALO=who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
Dialogue#GONZALO=they always use to laugh at nothing.
Dialogue#ANTONIO='Twas you we laughed at.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
Dialogue#GONZALO=to you: so you may continue and laugh at
Dialogue#GONZALO=nothing still.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=What a blow was there given!
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=An it had not fallen flat-long.
Dialogue#GONZALO=You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
Dialogue#GONZALO=the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
Dialogue#GONZALO=in it five weeks without changing.
Notice#Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
Dialogue#GONZALO=No, I warrant you; I will not adventure
Dialogue#GONZALO=my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
Dialogue#GONZALO=me asleep, for I am very heavy?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Go sleep, and hear us.
Notice#All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO
Dialogue#ALONSO=What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Dialogue#ALONSO=Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
Dialogue#ALONSO=They are inclined to do so.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Please you, sir,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=It is a comforter.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=                  We two, my lord,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Will guard your person while you take your rest,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And watch your safety.
Dialogue#ALONSO=Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
Notice#ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
Dialogue#ANTONIO=It is the quality o' the climate.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Why
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Myself disposed to sleep.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=They fell together all, as by consent;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
Dialogue#ANTONIO=My strong imagination sees a crown
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Dropping upon thy head.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=What, art thou waking?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Do you not hear me speak?
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=I do; and surely
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=This is a strange repose, to be asleep
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=And yet so fast asleep.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Noble Sebastian,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Whiles thou art waking.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Thou dost snore distinctly;
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=There's meaning in thy snores.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I am more serious than my custom: you
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Trebles thee o'er.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=                  Well, I am standing water.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I'll teach you how to flow.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Do so: to ebb
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Hereditary sloth instructs me.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=O,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Most often do so near the bottom run
Dialogue#ANTONIO=By their own fear or sloth.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Prithee, say on:
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Which throes thee much to yield.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Thus, sir:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Who shall be of as little memory
Dialogue#ANTONIO=When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--
Dialogue#ANTONIO=For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,
Dialogue#ANTONIO='Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And he that sleeps here swims.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=I have no hope
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=That he's undrown'd.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=O, out of that 'no hope'
Dialogue#ANTONIO=What great hope have you! no hope that way is
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Another way so high a hope that even
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
Dialogue#ANTONIO=That Ferdinand is drown'd?
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=He's gone.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Then, tell me,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Who's the next heir of Naples?
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Claribel.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells

Dialogue#CALIBAN=I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
Dialogue#CALIBAN=From me he got it. if thy greatness will
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=But this thing dare not,--
Dialogue#STEPHANO=That's most certain.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=How now shall this be compassed?
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Canst thou bring me to the party?
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.
Dialogue#ARIEL=Thou liest; thou canst not.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
Dialogue#CALIBAN=I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows
Dialogue#CALIBAN=And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
Dialogue#CALIBAN=He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Where the quick freshes are.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Trinculo, run into no further danger:
Dialogue#STEPHANO=interrupt the monster one word further, and,
Dialogue#STEPHANO=by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors
Dialogue#STEPHANO=and make a stock-fish of thee.
Dialogue#TRINCULO=Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther
Dialogue#TRINCULO=off.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Didst thou not say he lied?
Dialogue#ARIEL=Thou liest.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Do I so? take thou that.
Notice#Beats TRINCULO
Dialogue#STEPHANO=As you like this, give me the lie another time.
Dialogue#TRINCULO=I did not give the lie. Out o' your
Dialogue#TRINCULO=wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!
Dialogue#TRINCULO=this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on
Dialogue#TRINCULO=your monster, and the devil take your fingers!
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Ha, ha, ha!
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther
Dialogue#STEPHANO=off.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Beat him enough: after a little time
Dialogue#CALIBAN=I'll beat him too.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=                  Stand farther. Come, proceed.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Having first seized his books, or with a log
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
Dialogue#CALIBAN=First to possess his books; for without them
Dialogue#CALIBAN=He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
Dialogue#CALIBAN=One spirit to command: they all do hate him
Dialogue#CALIBAN=As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal
Dialogue#CALIBAN=And that most deeply to consider is
Dialogue#CALIBAN=The beauty of his daughter; he himself
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=But only Sycorax my dam and she;
Dialogue#CALIBAN=But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
Dialogue#CALIBAN=As great'st does least.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Is it so brave a lass?
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=And bring thee forth brave brood.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I
Dialogue#STEPHANO=will be king and queen--save our graces!--and
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou
Dialogue#STEPHANO=like the plot, Trinculo?
Dialogue#TRINCULO=Excellent.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,
Dialogue#STEPHANO=while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Within this half hour will he be asleep:
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Wilt thou destroy him then?
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Ay, on mine honour.
Dialogue#ARIEL=This will I tell my master.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
Dialogue#CALIBAN=You taught me but while-ere?
Dialogue#STEPHANO=At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any
Dialogue#STEPHANO=reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
Notice#Sings
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Flout 'em and scout 'em
Dialogue#STEPHANO=And scout 'em and flout 'em
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Thought is free.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=That's not the tune.
Notice#Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe
Dialogue#STEPHANO=What is this same?
Dialogue#TRINCULO=This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture
Dialogue#TRINCULO=of Nobody.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:
Dialogue#STEPHANO=if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.
Dialogue#TRINCULO=O, forgive me my sins!
Dialogue#STEPHANO=He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Art thou afeard?
Dialogue#STEPHANO=No, monster, not I.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices
Dialogue#CALIBAN=That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=The clouds methought would open and show riches
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=I cried to dream again.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall
Dialogue#STEPHANO=have my music for nothing.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=When Prospero is destroyed.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=That shall be by and by: I remember the story.
Dialogue#TRINCULO=The sound is going away; let's follow it, and
Dialogue#TRINCULO=after do our work.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see
Dialogue#STEPHANO=this tabourer; he lays it on.
Dialogue#TRINCULO=Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.

Dialogue#GONZALO=Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
Dialogue#GONZALO=I needs must rest me.
Dialogue#ALONSO=Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
Dialogue#ALONSO=Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
Dialogue#ALONSO=To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
Dialogue#ALONSO=Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
Dialogue#ALONSO=No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
Dialogue#ALONSO=Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
Dialogue#ALONSO=Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  I am right glad that he's so
Dialogue#ANTONIO=out of hope.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
Dialogue#ANTONIO=That you resolved to effect.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=[Aside to ANTONIO]  The next advantage
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Will we take throughly.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  Let it be to-night;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
Dialogue#ANTONIO=As when they are fresh.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=[Aside to ANTONIO]  I say, to-night: no more.
Notice#Solemn and strange music
Dialogue#ALONSO=What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!
Dialogue#GONZALO=Marvellous sweet music!
Notice# c. to eat, they depart
Dialogue#ALONSO=Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=A living drollery. Now I will believe
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=At this hour reigning there.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I'll believe both;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And what does else want credit, come to me,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did
Dialogue#ANTONIO=lie,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Though fools at home condemn 'em.
Dialogue#GONZALO=If in Naples
Dialogue#GONZALO=I should report this now, would they believe me?
Dialogue#GONZALO=If I should say, I saw such islanders--
Dialogue#GONZALO=For, certes, these are people of the island--
Dialogue#GONZALO=Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
Dialogue#GONZALO=Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
Dialogue#GONZALO=Our human generation you shall find
Dialogue#GONZALO=Many, nay, almost any.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=[Aside]              Honest lord,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Are worse than devils.
Dialogue#ALONSO=I cannot too much muse
Dialogue#ALONSO=Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,
Dialogue#ALONSO=Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
Dialogue#ALONSO=Of excellent dumb discourse.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=[Aside]	Praise in departing.
Dialogue#FRANCISCO=They vanish'd strangely.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=No matter, since
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Will't please you taste of what is here?
Dialogue#ALONSO=Not I.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
Dialogue#GONZALO=Who would believe that there were mountaineers
Dialogue#GONZALO=Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
Dialogue#GONZALO=Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
Dialogue#GONZALO=Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
Dialogue#GONZALO=Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
Dialogue#GONZALO=Good warrant of.
Dialogue#ALONSO=                  I will stand to and feed,
Dialogue#ALONSO=Although my last: no matter, since I feel
Dialogue#ALONSO=The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
Dialogue#ALONSO=Stand to and do as we.
Notice#Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a  harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes
Dialogue#ARIEL=You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
Dialogue#ARIEL=That hath to instrument this lower world
Dialogue#ARIEL=And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
Dialogue#ARIEL=Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
Dialogue#ARIEL=Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men

Dialogue#ARIEL=Their proper selves.
Notice# c. draw their swords
Dialogue#ARIEL=You fools! I and my fellows
Dialogue#ARIEL=Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
Dialogue#ARIEL=Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
Dialogue#ARIEL=Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
Dialogue#ARIEL=One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
Dialogue#ARIEL=Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
Dialogue#ARIEL=And will not be uplifted. But remember--
Dialogue#ARIEL=For that's my business to you--that you three
Dialogue#ARIEL=From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
Dialogue#ARIEL=Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
Dialogue#ARIEL=The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
Dialogue#ARIEL=Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
Dialogue#ARIEL=They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
Dialogue#ARIEL=Lingering perdition, worse than any death
Dialogue#ARIEL=Can be at once, shall step by step attend
Dialogue#ARIEL=You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
Dialogue#ARIEL=Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
Dialogue#ARIEL=Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
Dialogue#ARIEL=And a clear life ensuing.
Notice#He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music  enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
Dialogue#PROSPERO=In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And observation strange, my meaner ministers
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And these mine enemies are all knit up
Dialogue#PROSPERO=In their distractions; they now are in my power;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And his and mine loved darling.
Notice#Exit above
Dialogue#GONZALO=I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
Dialogue#GONZALO=In this strange stare?
Dialogue#ALONSO=O, it is monstrous, monstrous:
Dialogue#ALONSO=Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;
Dialogue#ALONSO=The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,
Dialogue#ALONSO=That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
Dialogue#ALONSO=The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
Dialogue#ALONSO=Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and
Dialogue#ALONSO=I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
Dialogue#ALONSO=And with him there lie mudded.

Dialogue#PROSPERO=I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Were but my trials of thy love and thou
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And make it halt behind her.
Dialogue#FERDINAND=I do believe it
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Against an oracle.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Worthily purchased take my daughter: but
Dialogue#PROSPERO=If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
Dialogue#PROSPERO=All sanctimonious ceremonies may
Dialogue#PROSPERO=With full and holy rite be minister'd,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To make this contract grow: but barren hate,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
Dialogue#PROSPERO=That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=As Hymen's lamps shall light you.
Dialogue#FERDINAND=As I hope
Dialogue#FERDINAND=For quiet days, fair issue and long life,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Our worser genius can, shall never melt
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Mine honour into lust, to take away
Dialogue#FERDINAND=The edge of that day's celebration
Dialogue#FERDINAND=When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Or Night kept chain'd below.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Fairly spoke.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!
Notice#Enter ARIEL
Dialogue#ARIEL=What would my potent master? here I am.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Did worthily perform; and I must use you
Dialogue#PROSPERO=In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Incite them to quick motion; for I must
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And they expect it from me.
Dialogue#ARIEL=Presently?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Ay, with a twink.
Dialogue#ARIEL=   Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'
Dialogue#ARIEL=And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'
Dialogue#ARIEL=Each one, tripping on his toe,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Will be here with mop and mow.

Dialogue#PROSPERO=Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Till thou dost hear me call.
Dialogue#ARIEL=Well, I conceive.

Dialogue#PROSPERO=Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Or else, good night your vow!
Dialogue#FERDINAND=I warrant you sir;
Dialogue#FERDINAND=The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Abates the ardour of my liver.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Well.

Dialogue#IRIS=Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
Dialogue#IRIS=Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid

Dialogue#PROSPERO=You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Our revels now are ended. These our actors,

Dialogue#PROSPERO=The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
Dialogue#PROSPERO=As dreams are made on, and our little life
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;

Dialogue#ARIEL=Lest I might anger thee.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?
Dialogue#ARIEL=I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
Dialogue#ARIEL=So fun of valour that they smote the air
Dialogue#ARIEL=For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
Dialogue#ARIEL=For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
Dialogue#ARIEL=Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;
Dialogue#ARIEL=At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd
Dialogue#ARIEL=their ears,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
Dialogue#ARIEL=As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
Dialogue#ARIEL=That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through

Dialogue#TRINCULO=Thou wert but a lost monster.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=All's hush'd as midnight yet.
Dialogue#TRINCULO=Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--
Dialogue#STEPHANO=There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,
Dialogue#STEPHANO=monster, but an infinite loss.
Dialogue#TRINCULO=That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your
Dialogue#TRINCULO=harmless fairy, monster.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears
Dialogue#STEPHANO=for my labour.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Do that good mischief which may make this island
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=For aye thy foot-licker.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.
Dialogue#TRINCULO=O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look
Dialogue#TRINCULO=what a wardrobe here is for thee!
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
Dialogue#TRINCULO=O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.
Dialogue#TRINCULO=O king Stephano!
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have
Dialogue#STEPHANO=that gown.
Dialogue#TRINCULO=Thy grace shall have it.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean
Dialogue#CALIBAN=To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
Dialogue#CALIBAN=And do the murder first: if he awake,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Make us strange stuff.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,
Dialogue#STEPHANO=is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under
Dialogue#STEPHANO=the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your
Dialogue#STEPHANO=hair and prove a bald jerkin.
Dialogue#TRINCULO=Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:
Dialogue#STEPHANO=wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this
Dialogue#STEPHANO=country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent
Dialogue#STEPHANO=pass of pate; there's another garment for't.
Dialogue#TRINCULO=Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and
Dialogue#TRINCULO=away with the rest.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,
Dialogue#CALIBAN=And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes
Dialogue#CALIBAN=With foreheads villanous low.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this
Dialogue#STEPHANO=away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you
Dialogue#STEPHANO=out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.
Dialogue#TRINCULO=And this.
Dialogue#STEPHANO=Ay, and this.
Notice#A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits,  in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Hey, Mountain, hey!
Dialogue#ARIEL=Silver I there it goes, Silver!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!
Notice#CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are driven out
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
Dialogue#PROSPERO=With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews
Dialogue#PROSPERO=With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Than pard or cat o' mountain.
Dialogue#ARIEL=Hark, they roar!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Follow, and do me service.

Banner#SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
Notice#Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Now does my project gather to a head:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?
Dialogue#ARIEL=On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
Dialogue#ARIEL=You said our work should cease.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I did say so,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=How fares the king and's followers?
Dialogue#ARIEL=Confined together
Dialogue#ARIEL=In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
Dialogue#ARIEL=In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
Dialogue#ARIEL=They cannot budge till your release. The king,
Dialogue#ARIEL=His brother and yours, abide all three distracted
Dialogue#ARIEL=And the remainder mourning over them,
Dialogue#ARIEL=Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
Dialogue#ARIEL=Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'
Dialogue#ARIEL=His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
Dialogue#ARIEL=From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
Dialogue#ARIEL=That if you now beheld them, your affections
Dialogue#ARIEL=Would become tender.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Dost thou think so, spirit?
Dialogue#ARIEL=Mine would, sir, were I human.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And mine shall.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Do I take part: the rarer action is
Dialogue#PROSPERO=In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And they shall be themselves.
Dialogue#ARIEL=I'll fetch them, sir.

Dialogue#PROSPERO=Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And ye that on the sands with printless foot
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
Dialogue#PROSPERO=When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
Dialogue#PROSPERO=By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
Dialogue#PROSPERO=With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The pine and cedar: graves at my command
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth
Dialogue#PROSPERO=By my so potent art. But this rough magic
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I here abjure, and, when I have required
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Some heavenly music, which even now I do,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To work mine end upon their senses that
Dialogue#PROSPERO=This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And deeper than did ever plummet sound
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I'll drown my book.
Notice#Solemn music
Notice#Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a  frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO;  SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,  attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO   they all  enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,  and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A solemn air and the best comforter
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=For you are spell-stopp'd.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And as the morning steals upon the night,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=My true preserver, and a loyal sir
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
Dialogue#PROSPERO=That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
Dialogue#PROSPERO=That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I will discase me, and myself present
Dialogue#PROSPERO=As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou shalt ere long be free.
Notice#ARIEL sings and helps to attire him
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Where the bee sucks. there suck I:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=In a cowslip's bell I lie;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=There I couch when owls do cry.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=On the bat's back I do fly
Dialogue#PROSPERO=After summer merrily.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Merrily, merrily shall I live now
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Being awake, enforce them to this place,

Dialogue#PROSPERO=Behold, sir king,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=For more assurance that a living prince
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And to thee and thy company I bid
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A hearty welcome.
Dialogue#ALONSO=                  Whether thou best he or no,
Dialogue#ALONSO=Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
Dialogue#ALONSO=As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
Dialogue#ALONSO=Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
Dialogue#ALONSO=The affliction of my mind amends, with which,
Dialogue#ALONSO=I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
Dialogue#ALONSO=An if this be at all, a most strange story.
Dialogue#ALONSO=Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
Dialogue#ALONSO=Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
Dialogue#ALONSO=Be living and be here?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=First, noble friend,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Be measured or confined.
Dialogue#GONZALO=Whether this be
Dialogue#GONZALO=Or be not, I'll not swear.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=You do yet taste
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!
Notice#Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
Dialogue#PROSPERO=But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And justify you traitors: at this time
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I will tell no tales.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=[Aside]  The devil speaks in him.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=No.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require
Dialogue#PROSPERO=My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Thou must restore.
Dialogue#ALONSO=                  If thou be'st Prospero,
Dialogue#ALONSO=Give us particulars of thy preservation;
Dialogue#ALONSO=How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
Dialogue#ALONSO=Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--
Dialogue#ALONSO=How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
Dialogue#ALONSO=My dear son Ferdinand.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I am woe for't, sir.
Dialogue#ALONSO=Irreparable is the loss, and patience
Dialogue#ALONSO=Says it is past her cure.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I rather think
Dialogue#PROSPERO=You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
Dialogue#PROSPERO=For the like loss I have her sovereign aid
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And rest myself content.
Dialogue#ALONSO=You the like loss!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=As great to me as late; and, supportable
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Than you may call to comfort you, for I
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Have lost my daughter.
Dialogue#ALONSO=A daughter?
Dialogue#ALONSO=O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
Dialogue#ALONSO=The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
Dialogue#ALONSO=Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
Dialogue#ALONSO=Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
Dialogue#PROSPERO=At this encounter do so much admire
Dialogue#PROSPERO=That they devour their reason and scarce think
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Been justled from your senses, know for certain
Dialogue#PROSPERO=That I am Prospero and that very duke
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Not a relation for a breakfast nor
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=This cell's my court: here have I few attendants
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=My dukedom since you have given me again,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I will requite you with as good a thing;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
Dialogue#PROSPERO=As much as me my dukedom.

Dialogue#MIRANDA=Sweet lord, you play me false.
Dialogue#FERDINAND=No, my dear'st love,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=I would not for the world.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
Dialogue#MIRANDA=And I would call it, fair play.
Dialogue#ALONSO=If this prove
Dialogue#ALONSO=A vision of the Island, one dear son
Dialogue#ALONSO=Shall I twice lose.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=A most high miracle!
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
Dialogue#FERDINAND=I have cursed them without cause.
Notice#Kneels
Dialogue#ALONSO=Now all the blessings
Dialogue#ALONSO=Of a glad father compass thee about!
Dialogue#ALONSO=Arise, and say how thou camest here.
Dialogue#MIRANDA=O, wonder!
Dialogue#MIRANDA=How many goodly creatures are there here!
Dialogue#MIRANDA=How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
Dialogue#MIRANDA=That has such people in't!
Dialogue#PROSPERO='Tis new to thee.
Dialogue#ALONSO=What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
Dialogue#ALONSO=Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
Dialogue#ALONSO=Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
Dialogue#ALONSO=And brought us thus together?
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Sir, she is mortal;
Dialogue#FERDINAND=But by immortal Providence she's mine:
Dialogue#FERDINAND=I chose her when I could not ask my father
Dialogue#FERDINAND=For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Of whom so often I have heard renown,
Dialogue#FERDINAND=But never saw before; of whom I have
Dialogue#FERDINAND=Received a second life; and second father
Dialogue#FERDINAND=This lady makes him to me.
Dialogue#ALONSO=I am hers:
Dialogue#ALONSO=But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
Dialogue#ALONSO=Must ask my child forgiveness!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=There, sir, stop:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Let us not burthen our remembrance with
Dialogue#PROSPERO=A heaviness that's gone.
Dialogue#GONZALO=I have inly wept,
Dialogue#GONZALO=Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,
Dialogue#GONZALO=And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
Dialogue#GONZALO=For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
Dialogue#GONZALO=Which brought us hither.
Dialogue#ALONSO=I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
Dialogue#GONZALO=Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
Dialogue#GONZALO=Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
Dialogue#GONZALO=Beyond a common joy, and set it down
Dialogue#GONZALO=With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
Dialogue#GONZALO=Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
Dialogue#GONZALO=And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
Dialogue#GONZALO=Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
Dialogue#GONZALO=In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
Dialogue#GONZALO=When no man was his own.
Dialogue#ALONSO=[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your hands:
Dialogue#ALONSO=Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
Dialogue#ALONSO=That doth not wish you joy!
Dialogue#GONZALO=Be it so! Amen!
Notice#Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following
Dialogue#GONZALO=O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
Dialogue#GONZALO=I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
Dialogue#GONZALO=This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
Dialogue#GONZALO=That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?
Dialogue#GONZALO=Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
Dialogue#Boatswain=The best news is, that we have safely found
Dialogue#Boatswain=Our king and company; the next, our ship--
Dialogue#Boatswain=Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
Dialogue#Boatswain=Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
Dialogue#Boatswain=We first put out to sea.
Dialogue#ARIEL=[Aside to PROSPERO]  Sir, all this service
Dialogue#ARIEL=Have I done since I went.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=[Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!
Dialogue#ALONSO=These are not natural events; they strengthen
Dialogue#ALONSO=From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?
Dialogue#Boatswain=If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
Dialogue#Boatswain=I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
Dialogue#Boatswain=And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;
Dialogue#Boatswain=Where but even now with strange and several noises
Dialogue#Boatswain=Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
Dialogue#Boatswain=And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,
Dialogue#Boatswain=We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;
Dialogue#Boatswain=Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
Dialogue#Boatswain=Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master
Dialogue#Boatswain=Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
Dialogue#Boatswain=Even in a dream, were we divided from them
Dialogue#Boatswain=And were brought moping hither.
Dialogue#ARIEL=[Aside to PROSPERO]          Was't well done?
Dialogue#PROSPERO=[Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.
Dialogue#ALONSO=This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
Dialogue#ALONSO=And there is in this business more than nature
Dialogue#ALONSO=Was ever conduct of: some oracle
Dialogue#ALONSO=Must rectify our knowledge.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Sir, my liege,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Do not infest your mind with beating on
Dialogue#PROSPERO=The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Which to you shall seem probable, of every
Dialogue#PROSPERO=These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And think of each thing well.

Dialogue#CALIBAN=O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
Dialogue#CALIBAN=How fine my master is! I am afraid
Dialogue#CALIBAN=He will chastise me.
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Ha, ha!
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=What things are these, my lord Antonio?
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Will money buy 'em?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Very like; one of them
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=His mother was a witch, and one so strong
Dialogue#PROSPERO=That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And deal in her command without her power.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--
Dialogue#PROSPERO=For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them
Dialogue#PROSPERO=To take my life. Two of these fellows you
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Must know and own; this thing of darkness!
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Acknowledge mine.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=                  I shall be pinch'd to death.
Dialogue#ALONSO=Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=He is drunk now: where had he wine?

Dialogue#ALONSO=How camest thou in this pickle?
Dialogue#TRINCULO=I have been in such a pickle since I

Dialogue#SEBASTIAN=Why, how now, Stephano!
Dialogue#STEPHANO=O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.

Dialogue#STEPHANO=I should have been a sore one then.
Dialogue#ALONSO=This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.
Notice#Pointing to Caliban

Dialogue#PROSPERO=To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.
Dialogue#CALIBAN=Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter

Dialogue#PROSPERO=With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Go quick away; the story of my life
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And the particular accidents gone by
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Where I have hope to see the nuptial
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;

Dialogue#ALONSO=I long
Dialogue#ALONSO=To hear the story of your life, which must
Dialogue#ALONSO=Take the ear strangely.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=I'll deliver all;

Dialogue#PROSPERO=And what strength I have's mine own,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,

Dialogue#PROSPERO=Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Since I have my dukedom got
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
Dialogue#PROSPERO=In this bare island by your spell;
Dialogue#PROSPERO=But release me from my bands
Dialogue#PROSPERO=With the help of your good hands:
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Gentle breath of yours my sails
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Must fill, or else my project fails,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Which was to please. Now I want
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=And my ending is despair,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Unless I be relieved by prayer,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Which pierces so that it assaults
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Mercy itself and frees all faults.
Dialogue#PROSPERO=As you from crimes would pardon'd be,
Dialogue#PROSPERO=Let your indulgence set me free.
