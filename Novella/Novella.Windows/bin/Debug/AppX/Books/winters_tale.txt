Notice:Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=the like occasion whereon my services are now on
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
Dialogue:CAMILLO=means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=justified in our loves; for indeed--
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Beseech you,--
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=us.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=They were trained together in their childhoods; and
Dialogue:CAMILLO=there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
Dialogue:CAMILLO=more mature dignities and royal necessities made
Dialogue:CAMILLO=separation of their society, their encounters,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
Dialogue:CAMILLO=with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
Dialogue:CAMILLO=embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
Dialogue:CAMILLO=embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
Dialogue:CAMILLO=winds. The heavens continue their loves!
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=I think there is not in the world either malice or
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=into my note.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
Dialogue:CAMILLO=is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
Dialogue:CAMILLO=subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
Dialogue:CAMILLO=crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
Dialogue:CAMILLO=see him a man.
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=Would they else be content to die?
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
Dialogue:CAMILLO=desire to live.
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=If the king had no son, they would desire to live
Dialogue:ARCHIDAMUS=on crutches till he had one.
Notice:Exeunt

Notice:Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Nine changes of the watery star hath been
Dialogue:POLIXENES=The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Without a burthen: time as long again
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;
Dialogue:POLIXENES=And yet we should, for perpetuity,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
Dialogue:POLIXENES=With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
Dialogue:POLIXENES=That go before it.
Dialogue:LEONTES=                  Stay your thanks a while;
Dialogue:LEONTES=And pay them when you part.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Sir, that's to-morrow.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
Dialogue:POLIXENES=No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
Dialogue:POLIXENES='This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
Dialogue:POLIXENES=To tire your royalty.
Dialogue:LEONTES=We are tougher, brother,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Than you can put us to't.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=No longer stay.
Dialogue:LEONTES=One seven-night longer.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Very sooth, to-morrow.
Dialogue:LEONTES=We'll part the time between's then; and in that
Dialogue:LEONTES=I'll no gainsaying.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Press me not, beseech you, so.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Were there necessity in your request, although
Dialogue:POLIXENES='Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
Dialogue:POLIXENES=To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Farewell, our brother.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Tongue-tied, our queen?
Dialogue:LEONTES=speak you.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
Dialogue:HERMIONE=You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
Dialogue:HERMIONE=All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
Dialogue:HERMIONE=The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=He's beat from his best ward.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Well said, Hermione.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
Dialogue:HERMIONE=But let him say so then, and let him go;
Dialogue:HERMIONE=But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
Dialogue:HERMIONE=The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
Dialogue:HERMIONE=You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
Dialogue:HERMIONE=To let him there a month behind the gest
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
Dialogue:HERMIONE=What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?
Dialogue:POLIXENES=No, madam.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Nay, but you will?
Dialogue:POLIXENES=                  I may not, verily.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Verily!
Dialogue:HERMIONE=You put me off with limber vows; but I,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Though you would seek to unsphere the
Dialogue:HERMIONE=stars with oaths,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
Dialogue:HERMIONE=As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
Dialogue:HERMIONE=When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
Dialogue:HERMIONE=My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
Dialogue:HERMIONE=One of them you shall be.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Your guest, then, madam:
Dialogue:POLIXENES=To be your prisoner should import offending;
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Which is for me less easy to commit
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Than you to punish.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Not your gaoler, then,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
Dialogue:HERMIONE=You were pretty lordings then?
Dialogue:POLIXENES=We were, fair queen,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Two lads that thought there was no more behind
Dialogue:POLIXENES=But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=And to be boy eternal.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Was not my lord
Dialogue:HERMIONE=The verier wag o' the two?
Dialogue:POLIXENES=We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
Dialogue:POLIXENES=The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
Dialogue:POLIXENES=That any did. Had we pursued that life,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
Dialogue:POLIXENES=With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Hereditary ours.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=                  By this we gather
Dialogue:HERMIONE=You have tripp'd since.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=O my most sacred lady!
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Temptations have since then been born to's; for
Dialogue:POLIXENES=In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Of my young play-fellow.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Grace to boot!
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
Dialogue:HERMIONE=The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
Dialogue:HERMIONE=You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
Dialogue:HERMIONE=With any but with us.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Is he won yet?
Dialogue:HERMIONE=He'll stay my lord.
Dialogue:LEONTES=At my request he would not.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
Dialogue:LEONTES=To better purpose.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=                                 Never?
Dialogue:LEONTES=Never, but once.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
Dialogue:HERMIONE=I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
Dialogue:HERMIONE=As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
Dialogue:HERMIONE=With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
Dialogue:HERMIONE=With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
Dialogue:HERMIONE=My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
Dialogue:HERMIONE=What was my first? it has an elder sister,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
Dialogue:HERMIONE=But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Nay, let me have't; I long.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Why, that was when
Dialogue:LEONTES=Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
Dialogue:LEONTES=And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
Dialogue:LEONTES='I am yours for ever.'
Dialogue:HERMIONE='Tis grace indeed.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
Dialogue:HERMIONE=The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
Dialogue:HERMIONE=The other for some while a friend.
Dialogue:LEONTES=[Aside]	Too hot, too hot!
Dialogue:LEONTES=To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
Dialogue:LEONTES=I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;
Dialogue:LEONTES=But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment
Dialogue:LEONTES=May a free face put on, derive a liberty
Dialogue:LEONTES=From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
Dialogue:LEONTES=And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;
Dialogue:LEONTES=But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
Dialogue:LEONTES=As now they are, and making practised smiles,
Dialogue:LEONTES=As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere
Dialogue:LEONTES=The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment
Dialogue:LEONTES=My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Art thou my boy?
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=                           Ay, my good lord.
Dialogue:LEONTES=I' fecks!
Dialogue:LEONTES=Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
Dialogue:LEONTES=smutch'd thy nose?
Dialogue:LEONTES=They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
Dialogue:LEONTES=We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
Dialogue:LEONTES=And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
Dialogue:LEONTES=Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
Dialogue:LEONTES=Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
Dialogue:LEONTES=Art thou my calf?
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=                  Yes, if you will, my lord.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
Dialogue:LEONTES=To be full like me: yet they say we are
Dialogue:LEONTES=Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
Dialogue:LEONTES=That will say anything but were they false
Dialogue:LEONTES=As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
Dialogue:LEONTES=As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
Dialogue:LEONTES=No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
Dialogue:LEONTES=To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
Dialogue:LEONTES=Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
Dialogue:LEONTES=Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
Dialogue:LEONTES=Thou dost make possible things not so held,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--
Dialogue:LEONTES=With what's unreal thou coactive art,
Dialogue:LEONTES=And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
Dialogue:LEONTES=Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
Dialogue:LEONTES=And that beyond commission, and I find it,
Dialogue:LEONTES=And that to the infection of my brains
Dialogue:LEONTES=And hardening of my brows.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=What means Sicilia?
Dialogue:HERMIONE=He something seems unsettled.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=How, my lord!
Dialogue:POLIXENES=What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?
Dialogue:HERMIONE=You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Are you moved, my lord?
Dialogue:LEONTES=No, in good earnest.
Dialogue:LEONTES=How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
Dialogue:LEONTES=To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
Dialogue:LEONTES=Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
Dialogue:LEONTES=Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
Dialogue:LEONTES=In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
Dialogue:LEONTES=As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
Dialogue:LEONTES=How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
Dialogue:LEONTES=This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Will you take eggs for money?
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=No, my lord, I'll fight.
Dialogue:LEONTES=You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Are you so fond of your young prince as we
Dialogue:LEONTES=Do seem to be of ours?
Dialogue:POLIXENES=If at home, sir,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
Dialogue:POLIXENES=He makes a July's day short as December,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=And with his varying childness cures in me
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Thoughts that would thick my blood.
Dialogue:LEONTES=So stands this squire
Dialogue:LEONTES=Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
Dialogue:LEONTES=And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
Dialogue:LEONTES=How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;
Dialogue:LEONTES=Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
Dialogue:LEONTES=Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
Dialogue:LEONTES=Apparent to my heart.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=If you would seek us,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?
Dialogue:LEONTES=To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Be you beneath the sky.
Notice:Aside
Dialogue:LEONTES=I am angling now,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Though you perceive me not how I give line.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Go to, go to!
Dialogue:LEONTES=How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
Dialogue:LEONTES=And arms her with the boldness of a wife
Dialogue:LEONTES=To her allowing husband!
Notice:Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants
Dialogue:LEONTES=Gone already!
Dialogue:LEONTES=Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
Dialogue:LEONTES=ears a fork'd one!
Dialogue:LEONTES=Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
Dialogue:LEONTES=Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
Dialogue:LEONTES=Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
Dialogue:LEONTES=Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
Dialogue:LEONTES=There have been,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
Dialogue:LEONTES=And many a man there is, even at this present,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
Dialogue:LEONTES=That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
Dialogue:LEONTES=And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
Dialogue:LEONTES=Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
Dialogue:LEONTES=Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
Dialogue:LEONTES=As mine, against their will. Should all despair
Dialogue:LEONTES=That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
Dialogue:LEONTES=Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
Dialogue:LEONTES=It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
Dialogue:LEONTES=Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
Dialogue:LEONTES=From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
Dialogue:LEONTES=No barricado for a belly; know't;
Dialogue:LEONTES=It will let in and out the enemy
Dialogue:LEONTES=With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
Dialogue:LEONTES=Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=I am like you, they say.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Ay, my good lord.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.
Notice:Exit MAMILLIUS
Dialogue:LEONTES=Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
Dialogue:CAMILLO=When you cast out, it still came home.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Didst note it?
Dialogue:CAMILLO=He would not stay at your petitions: made
Dialogue:CAMILLO=His business more material.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Didst perceive it?
Notice:Aside
Dialogue:LEONTES=They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
Dialogue:LEONTES='Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
Dialogue:LEONTES=When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
Dialogue:LEONTES=That he did stay?
Dialogue:CAMILLO=                  At the good queen's entreaty.
Dialogue:LEONTES=At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
Dialogue:LEONTES=But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
Dialogue:LEONTES=By any understanding pate but thine?
Dialogue:LEONTES=For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
Dialogue:LEONTES=More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
Dialogue:LEONTES=But of the finer natures? by some severals
Dialogue:LEONTES=Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Dialogue:LEONTES=Perchance are to this business purblind? say.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Business, my lord! I think most understand
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Bohemia stays here longer.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Ha!
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Stays here longer.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Ay, but why?
Dialogue:CAMILLO=To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Of our most gracious mistress.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Satisfy!
Dialogue:LEONTES=The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
Dialogue:LEONTES=Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
Dialogue:LEONTES=With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
Dialogue:LEONTES=My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
Dialogue:LEONTES=Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
Dialogue:LEONTES=Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
Dialogue:LEONTES=Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
Dialogue:LEONTES=In that which seems so.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Be it forbid, my lord!
Dialogue:LEONTES=To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
Dialogue:LEONTES=If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
Dialogue:LEONTES=From course required; or else thou must be counted
Dialogue:LEONTES=A servant grafted in my serious trust
Dialogue:LEONTES=And therein negligent; or else a fool
Dialogue:LEONTES=That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
Dialogue:LEONTES=And takest it all for jest.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=My gracious lord,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
Dialogue:CAMILLO=In every one of these no man is free,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Among the infinite doings of the world,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=If ever I were wilful-negligent,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=It was my folly; if industriously
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
Dialogue:CAMILLO=To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Where of the execution did cry out
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
Dialogue:CAMILLO=By its own visage: if I then deny it,
Dialogue:CAMILLO='Tis none of mine.
Dialogue:LEONTES=                  Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
Dialogue:LEONTES=But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
Dialogue:LEONTES=Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
Dialogue:LEONTES=For to a vision so apparent rumour
Dialogue:LEONTES=Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
Dialogue:LEONTES=Resides not in that man that does not think,--
Dialogue:LEONTES=My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Or else be impudently negative,
Dialogue:LEONTES=To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
Dialogue:LEONTES=My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
Dialogue:LEONTES=As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
Dialogue:LEONTES=Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I would not be a stander-by to hear
Dialogue:CAMILLO=My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
Dialogue:CAMILLO=My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=You never spoke what did become you less
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Than this; which to reiterate were sin
Dialogue:CAMILLO=As deep as that, though true.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Is whispering nothing?
Dialogue:LEONTES=Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
Dialogue:LEONTES=Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
Dialogue:LEONTES=Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
Dialogue:LEONTES=Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
Dialogue:LEONTES=Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
Dialogue:LEONTES=Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
Dialogue:LEONTES=Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
Dialogue:LEONTES=That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
Dialogue:LEONTES=Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
Dialogue:LEONTES=The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
Dialogue:LEONTES=My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,
Dialogue:LEONTES=If this be nothing.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Good my lord, be cured
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
Dialogue:CAMILLO=For 'tis most dangerous.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Say it be, 'tis true.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=No, no, my lord.
Dialogue:LEONTES=                  It is; you lie, you lie:
Dialogue:LEONTES=I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Or else a hovering temporizer, that
Dialogue:LEONTES=Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
Dialogue:LEONTES=Infected as her life, she would not live
Dialogue:LEONTES=The running of one glass.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Who does infect her?
Dialogue:LEONTES=Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
Dialogue:LEONTES=About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
Dialogue:LEONTES=Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
Dialogue:LEONTES=To see alike mine honour as their profits,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
Dialogue:LEONTES=Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
Dialogue:LEONTES=His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
Dialogue:LEONTES=Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
Dialogue:LEONTES=Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
Dialogue:LEONTES=How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
Dialogue:LEONTES=To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
Dialogue:LEONTES=Which draught to me were cordial.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Sir, my lord,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=But with a lingering dram that should not work
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=So sovereignly being honourable.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I have loved thee,--
Dialogue:LEONTES=Make that thy question, and go rot!
Dialogue:LEONTES=Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
Dialogue:LEONTES=To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
Dialogue:LEONTES=The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
Dialogue:LEONTES=Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
Dialogue:LEONTES=Could man so blench?
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I must believe you, sir:
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Provided that, when he's removed, your highness
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Will take again your queen as yours at first,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
Dialogue:CAMILLO=The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Known and allied to yours.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Thou dost advise me
Dialogue:LEONTES=Even so as I mine own course have set down:
Dialogue:LEONTES=I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=My lord,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Go then; and with a countenance as clear
Dialogue:CAMILLO=As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
Dialogue:CAMILLO=And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
Dialogue:CAMILLO=If from me he have wholesome beverage,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Account me not your servant.
Dialogue:LEONTES=This is all:
Dialogue:LEONTES=Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
Dialogue:LEONTES=Do't not, thou split'st thine own.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I'll do't, my lord.
Dialogue:LEONTES=I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.
Notice:Exit
Dialogue:CAMILLO=O miserable lady! But, for me,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Is the obedience to a master, one
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Who in rebellion with himself will have
Dialogue:CAMILLO=All that are his so too. To do this deed,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Promotion follows. If I could find example
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
Dialogue:CAMILLO=And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Let villany itself forswear't. I must
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain
Dialogue:CAMILLO=To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Here comes Bohemia.
Notice:Re-enter POLIXENES
Dialogue:POLIXENES=This is strange: methinks
Dialogue:POLIXENES=My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Good day, Camillo.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=                  Hail, most royal sir!
Dialogue:POLIXENES=What is the news i' the court?
Dialogue:CAMILLO=None rare, my lord.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=The king hath on him such a countenance
Dialogue:POLIXENES=As he had lost some province and a region
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
Dialogue:POLIXENES=With customary compliment; when he,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
Dialogue:POLIXENES=A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
Dialogue:POLIXENES=So leaves me to consider what is breeding
Dialogue:POLIXENES=That changeth thus his manners.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I dare not know, my lord.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
Dialogue:POLIXENES=For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be
Dialogue:POLIXENES=A party in this alteration, finding
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Myself thus alter'd with 't.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=There is a sickness
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Which puts some of us in distemper, but
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Of you that yet are well.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=How! caught of me!
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
Dialogue:POLIXENES=I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
Dialogue:POLIXENES=By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
Dialogue:POLIXENES=As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
Dialogue:POLIXENES=In ignorant concealment.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I may not answer.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
Dialogue:POLIXENES=I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
Dialogue:POLIXENES=What incidency thou dost guess of harm
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Which way to be prevented, if to be;
Dialogue:POLIXENES=If not, how best to bear it.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Sir, I will tell you;
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Since I am charged in honour and by him
Dialogue:CAMILLO=That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Cry lost, and so good night!
Dialogue:POLIXENES=On, good Camillo.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I am appointed him to murder you.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=By whom, Camillo?
Dialogue:CAMILLO=                        By the king.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=For what?
Dialogue:CAMILLO=He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=As he had seen't or been an instrument
Dialogue:CAMILLO=To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Forbiddenly.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=                  O, then my best blood turn
Dialogue:POLIXENES=To an infected jelly and my name
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Turn then my freshest reputation to
Dialogue:POLIXENES=A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
Dialogue:POLIXENES=That e'er was heard or read!
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Swear his thought over
Dialogue:CAMILLO=By each particular star in heaven and
Dialogue:CAMILLO=By all their influences, you may as well
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
Dialogue:CAMILLO=As or by oath remove or counsel shake
Dialogue:CAMILLO=The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Is piled upon his faith and will continue
Dialogue:CAMILLO=The standing of his body.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=How should this grow?
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Your followers I will whisper to the business,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=And will by twos and threes at several posterns
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put
Dialogue:CAMILLO=My fortunes to your service, which are here
Dialogue:CAMILLO=By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
Dialogue:CAMILLO=For, by the honour of my parents, I
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon
Dialogue:CAMILLO=His execution sworn.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=I do believe thee:
Dialogue:POLIXENES=I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Be pilot to me and thy places shall
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
Dialogue:POLIXENES=My people did expect my hence departure
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Two days ago. This jealousy
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
Dialogue:POLIXENES=He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
Dialogue:POLIXENES=In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
Dialogue:POLIXENES=The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;
Dialogue:POLIXENES=I will respect thee as a father if
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=It is in mine authority to command
Dialogue:CAMILLO=The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
Dialogue:CAMILLO=To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.

Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=No, I'll none of you.
Dialogue:First Lady=Why, my sweet lord?
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=I were a baby still. I love you better.
Dialogue:Second Lady=And why so, my lord?
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=Not for because
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=Become some women best, so that there be not
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=Or a half-moon made with a pen.
Dialogue:Second Lady=Who taught you this?
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=What colour are your eyebrows?
Dialogue:First Lady=Blue, my lord.
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
Dialogue:First Lady=Hark ye;
Dialogue:First Lady=The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
Dialogue:First Lady=Present our services to a fine new prince
Dialogue:First Lady=One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,
Dialogue:First Lady=If we would have you.
Dialogue:Second Lady=She is spread of late

Dialogue:HERMIONE=What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
Dialogue:HERMIONE=I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=And tell 's a tale.
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=Merry or sad shall't be?
Dialogue:HERMIONE=As merry as you will.
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=Of sprites and goblins.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Let's have that, good sir.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best

Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=There was a man--
Dialogue:HERMIONE=                  Nay, come, sit down; then on.
Dialogue:MAMILLIUS=Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;

Dialogue:HERMIONE=Come on, then,

Notice:Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others
Dialogue:LEONTES=Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
Dialogue:First Lord=Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
Dialogue:First Lord=Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
Dialogue:First Lord=Even to their ships.
Dialogue:LEONTES=How blest am I
Dialogue:LEONTES=In my just censure, in my true opinion!
Dialogue:LEONTES=Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
Dialogue:LEONTES=In being so blest! There may be in the cup
Dialogue:LEONTES=A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
Dialogue:LEONTES=And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
Dialogue:LEONTES=Is not infected: but if one present
Dialogue:LEONTES=The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
Dialogue:LEONTES=How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
Dialogue:LEONTES=With violent hefts. I have drunk,
Dialogue:LEONTES=and seen the spider.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
Dialogue:LEONTES=There is a plot against my life, my crown;
Dialogue:LEONTES=All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
Dialogue:LEONTES=Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
Dialogue:LEONTES=He has discover'd my design, and I
Dialogue:LEONTES=Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
Dialogue:LEONTES=For them to play at will. How came the posterns
Dialogue:LEONTES=So easily open?
Dialogue:First Lord=                  By his great authority;
Dialogue:First Lord=Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
Dialogue:First Lord=On your command.
Dialogue:LEONTES=                          I know't too well.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
Dialogue:LEONTES=Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
Dialogue:LEONTES=Have too much blood in him.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=What is this? sport?
Dialogue:LEONTES=Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
Dialogue:LEONTES=Away with him! and let her sport herself
Dialogue:LEONTES=With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
Dialogue:LEONTES=Has made thee swell thus.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=But I'ld say he had not,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Howe'er you lean to the nayward.
Dialogue:LEONTES=You, my lords,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Look on her, mark her well; be but about
Dialogue:LEONTES=To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
Dialogue:LEONTES=The justice of your bearts will thereto add
Dialogue:LEONTES='Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'
Dialogue:LEONTES=Praise her but for this her without-door form,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
Dialogue:LEONTES=The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
Dialogue:LEONTES=That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
Dialogue:LEONTES=That mercy does, for calumny will sear
Dialogue:LEONTES=Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,

Dialogue:LEONTES=Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
Dialogue:LEONTES=From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
Dialogue:LEONTES=She's an adulteress.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Should a villain say so,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=The most replenish'd villain in the world,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Do but mistake.
Dialogue:LEONTES=                  You have mistook, my lady,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
Dialogue:LEONTES=Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Should a like language use to all degrees
Dialogue:LEONTES=And mannerly distinguishment leave out
Dialogue:LEONTES=Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
Dialogue:LEONTES=She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
Dialogue:LEONTES=More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
Dialogue:LEONTES=A federary with her, and one that knows
Dialogue:LEONTES=What she should shame to know herself
Dialogue:LEONTES=But with her most vile principal, that she's
Dialogue:LEONTES=A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
Dialogue:LEONTES=That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
Dialogue:LEONTES=To this their late escape.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=No, by my life.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
Dialogue:HERMIONE=You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=You scarce can right me throughly then to say
Dialogue:HERMIONE=You did mistake.
Dialogue:LEONTES=                  No; if I mistake
Dialogue:LEONTES=In those foundations which I build upon,
Dialogue:LEONTES=The centre is not big enough to bear
Dialogue:LEONTES=A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
Dialogue:LEONTES=He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
Dialogue:LEONTES=But that he speaks.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=There's some ill planet reigns:
Dialogue:HERMIONE=I must be patient till the heavens look
Dialogue:HERMIONE=With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
Dialogue:HERMIONE=That honourable grief lodged here which burns
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=With thoughts so qualified as your charities
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
Dialogue:HERMIONE=The king's will be perform'd!
Dialogue:LEONTES=Shall I be heard?
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=My women may be with me; for you see
Dialogue:HERMIONE=My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
Dialogue:HERMIONE=There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
Dialogue:HERMIONE=As I come out: this action I now go on
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
Dialogue:HERMIONE=I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
Dialogue:HERMIONE=I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.

Dialogue:First Lord=Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless
Dialogue:First Lord=I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,
Dialogue:First Lord=In this which you accuse her.
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=If it prove
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=For every inch of woman in the world,
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.
Dialogue:LEONTES=         Hold your peaces.
Dialogue:First Lord=Good my lord,--
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=You are abused and by some putter-on
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=The second and the third, nine, and some five;
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=If this prove true, they'll pay for't:
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=by mine honour,
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=And I had rather glib myself than they
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=Should not produce fair issue.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Cease; no more.
Dialogue:LEONTES=You smell this business with a sense as cold
Dialogue:LEONTES=As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
Dialogue:LEONTES=As you feel doing thus; and see withal
Dialogue:LEONTES=The instruments that feel.
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=If it be so,
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=We need no grave to bury honesty:
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=Of the whole dungy earth.
Dialogue:LEONTES=What! lack I credit?
Dialogue:First Lord=I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
Dialogue:First Lord=Upon this ground; and more it would content me
Dialogue:First Lord=To have her honour true than your suspicion,
Dialogue:First Lord=Be blamed for't how you might.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Why, what need we
Dialogue:LEONTES=Commune with you of this, but rather follow
Dialogue:LEONTES=Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
Dialogue:LEONTES=Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
Dialogue:LEONTES=Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
Dialogue:LEONTES=Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
Dialogue:LEONTES=Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
Dialogue:LEONTES=We need no more of your advice: the matter,
Dialogue:LEONTES=The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
Dialogue:LEONTES=Properly ours.
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=                  And I wish, my liege,
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
Dialogue:ANTIGONUS=Without more overture.
Dialogue:LEONTES=How could that be?
Dialogue:LEONTES=Either thou art most ignorant by age,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Added to their familiarity,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
Dialogue:LEONTES=That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
Dialogue:LEONTES=But only seeing, all other circumstances
Dialogue:LEONTES=Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
Dialogue:LEONTES=Yet, for a greater confirmation,
Dialogue:LEONTES=For in an act of this importance 'twere
Dialogue:LEONTES=Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
Dialogue:LEONTES=To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
Dialogue:LEONTES=Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
Dialogue:LEONTES=They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
Dialogue:First Lord=Well done, my lord.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Though I am satisfied and need no more
Dialogue:LEONTES=Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
Dialogue:LEONTES=Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
Dialogue:LEONTES=Whose ignorant credulity will not
Dialogue:LEONTES=Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
Dialogue:LEONTES=From our free person she should be confined,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
Dialogue:LEONTES=Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
Dialogue:LEONTES=We are to speak in public; for this business

Dialogue:PAULINA=I care not:
Dialogue:PAULINA=It is an heretic that makes the fire,

Dialogue:LEONTES=Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.

Dialogue:Officer=arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery
Dialogue:Officer=with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring

Dialogue:Officer=whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,
Dialogue:Officer=thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance
Dialogue:Officer=of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for

Dialogue:HERMIONE=Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Behold our human actions, as they do,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=I doubt not then but innocence shall make

Dialogue:HERMIONE=As I am now unhappy; which is more

Dialogue:LEONTES=I ne'er heard yet
Dialogue:LEONTES=That any of these bolder vices wanted
Dialogue:LEONTES=Less impudence to gainsay what they did
Dialogue:LEONTES=Than to perform it first.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=That's true enough;

Dialogue:LEONTES=You will not own it.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=More than mistress of
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
Dialogue:HERMIONE=At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,

Dialogue:HERMIONE=With such a kind of love as might become
Dialogue:HERMIONE=A lady like me, with a love even such,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=So and no other, as yourself commanded:
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Which not to have done I think had been in me
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Both disobedience and ingratitude
Dialogue:HERMIONE=To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
Dialogue:HERMIONE=That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
Dialogue:HERMIONE=For me to try how: all I know of it
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Is that Camillo was an honest man;
Dialogue:HERMIONE=And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.
Dialogue:LEONTES=You knew of his departure, as you know
Dialogue:LEONTES=What you have underta'en to do in's absence.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Sir,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=You speak a language that I understand not:
Dialogue:HERMIONE=My life stands in the level of your dreams,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Which I'll lay down.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Your actions are my dreams;
Dialogue:LEONTES=You had a bastard by Polixenes,
Dialogue:LEONTES=And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
Dialogue:LEONTES=Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
Dialogue:LEONTES=Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
Dialogue:LEONTES=Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,

Dialogue:HERMIONE=But know not how it went. My second joy
Dialogue:HERMIONE=And first-fruits of my body, from his presence

Dialogue:HERMIONE=But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else

Dialogue:Shepherd=We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires

Banner:SCENE II. Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.
Notice:Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO
Dialogue:POLIXENES=I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:
Dialogue:POLIXENES='tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to
Dialogue:POLIXENES=grant this.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I have for the most part been aired abroad, I
Dialogue:CAMILLO=desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
Dialogue:CAMILLO=king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling
Dialogue:CAMILLO=sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to
Dialogue:CAMILLO=think so, which is another spur to my departure.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of
Dialogue:POLIXENES=thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of
Dialogue:POLIXENES=thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to
Dialogue:POLIXENES=have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having
Dialogue:POLIXENES=made me businesses which none without thee can
Dialogue:POLIXENES=sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute
Dialogue:POLIXENES=them thyself or take away with thee the very
Dialogue:POLIXENES=services thou hast done; which if I have not enough
Dialogue:POLIXENES=considered, as too much I cannot, to be more
Dialogue:POLIXENES=thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit
Dialogue:POLIXENES=therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
Dialogue:POLIXENES=country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very
Dialogue:POLIXENES=naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
Dialogue:POLIXENES=penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen
Dialogue:POLIXENES=and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my
Dialogue:POLIXENES=son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not
Dialogue:POLIXENES=being gracious, than they are in losing them when
Dialogue:POLIXENES=they have approved their virtues.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What
Dialogue:CAMILLO=his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I
Dialogue:CAMILLO=have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
Dialogue:CAMILLO=from court and is less frequent to his princely
Dialogue:CAMILLO=exercises than formerly he hath appeared.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some
Dialogue:POLIXENES=care; so far that I have eyes under my service which
Dialogue:POLIXENES=look upon his removedness; from whom I have this
Dialogue:POLIXENES=intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a
Dialogue:POLIXENES=most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from
Dialogue:POLIXENES=very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
Dialogue:POLIXENES=neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
Dialogue:CAMILLO=daughter of most rare note: the report of her is
Dialogue:CAMILLO=extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I
Dialogue:POLIXENES=fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
Dialogue:POLIXENES=shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not
Dialogue:POLIXENES=appearing what we are, have some question with the
Dialogue:POLIXENES=shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not
Dialogue:POLIXENES=uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and
Dialogue:POLIXENES=lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I willingly obey your command.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.

Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is

Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=that kills my heart.
Dialogue:Clown=What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.
Dialogue:Clown=His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped
Dialogue:Clown=out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay
Dialogue:Clown=there; and yet it will no more but abide.
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=wife within a mile where my land and living lies;
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=and, having flown over many knavish professions, he
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.
Dialogue:Clown=Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts
Dialogue:Clown=wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=put me into this apparel.
Dialogue:Clown=Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
Dialogue:Clown=but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=him.
Dialogue:Clown=How do you now?
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and

Dialogue:PERDITA=Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
Dialogue:PERDITA=To think your father, by some accident,
Dialogue:PERDITA=Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
Dialogue:PERDITA=How would he look, to see his work so noble
Dialogue:PERDITA=Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
Dialogue:PERDITA=Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
Dialogue:PERDITA=The sternness of his presence?
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Apprehend
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Humbling their deities to love, have taken
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=As I seem now. Their transformations
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Burn hotter than my faith.
Dialogue:PERDITA=O, but, sir,
Dialogue:PERDITA=Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
Dialogue:PERDITA=Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
Dialogue:PERDITA=One of these two must be necessities,
Dialogue:PERDITA=Which then will speak, that you must
Dialogue:PERDITA=change this purpose,
Dialogue:PERDITA=Or I my life.
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=                  Thou dearest Perdita,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Or not my father's. For I cannot be
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Of celebration of that nuptial which
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=We two have sworn shall come.
Dialogue:PERDITA=O lady Fortune,
Dialogue:PERDITA=Stand you auspicious!
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=See, your guests approach:
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=And let's be red with mirth.
Notice:Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised
Dialogue:Shepherd=Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
Dialogue:Shepherd=This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
Dialogue:Shepherd=Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;
Dialogue:Shepherd=Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
Dialogue:Shepherd=At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;
Dialogue:Shepherd=On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
Dialogue:Shepherd=With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
Dialogue:Shepherd=She would to each one sip. You are retired,
Dialogue:Shepherd=As if you were a feasted one and not
Dialogue:Shepherd=The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid
Dialogue:Shepherd=These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is
Dialogue:Shepherd=A way to make us better friends, more known.
Dialogue:Shepherd=Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
Dialogue:Shepherd=That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,
Dialogue:Shepherd=And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
Dialogue:Shepherd=As your good flock shall prosper.
Dialogue:PERDITA=[To POLIXENES]                  Sir, welcome:
Dialogue:PERDITA=It is my father's will I should take on me
Dialogue:PERDITA=The hostess-ship o' the day.
Notice:To CAMILLO
Dialogue:PERDITA=You're welcome, sir.
Dialogue:PERDITA=Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,
Dialogue:PERDITA=For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep
Dialogue:PERDITA=Seeming and savour all the winter long:
Dialogue:PERDITA=Grace and remembrance be to you both,
Dialogue:PERDITA=And welcome to our shearing!
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Shepherdess,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=A fair one are you--well you fit our ages
Dialogue:POLIXENES=With flowers of winter.
Dialogue:PERDITA=Sir, the year growing ancient,
Dialogue:PERDITA=Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
Dialogue:PERDITA=Of trembling winter, the fairest
Dialogue:PERDITA=flowers o' the season
Dialogue:PERDITA=Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
Dialogue:PERDITA=Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
Dialogue:PERDITA=Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
Dialogue:PERDITA=To get slips of them.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Wherefore, gentle maiden,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Do you neglect them?
Dialogue:PERDITA=For I have heard it said
Dialogue:PERDITA=There is an art which in their piedness shares
Dialogue:PERDITA=With great creating nature.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Say there be;
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Yet nature is made better by no mean
Dialogue:POLIXENES=But nature makes that mean: so, over that art
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Which you say adds to nature, is an art
Dialogue:POLIXENES=That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
Dialogue:POLIXENES=A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=And make conceive a bark of baser kind
Dialogue:POLIXENES=By bud of nobler race: this is an art
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
Dialogue:POLIXENES=The art itself is nature.
Dialogue:PERDITA=So it is.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=And do not call them bastards.
Dialogue:PERDITA=I'll not put
Dialogue:PERDITA=The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
Dialogue:PERDITA=No more than were I painted I would wish
Dialogue:PERDITA=This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
Dialogue:PERDITA=Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
Dialogue:PERDITA=Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
Dialogue:PERDITA=The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
Dialogue:PERDITA=And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
Dialogue:PERDITA=Of middle summer, and I think they are given
Dialogue:PERDITA=To men of middle age. You're very welcome.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=And only live by gazing.
Dialogue:PERDITA=Out, alas!
Dialogue:PERDITA=You'd be so lean, that blasts of January
Dialogue:PERDITA=Would blow you through and through.
Dialogue:PERDITA=Now, my fair'st friend,
Dialogue:PERDITA=I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
Dialogue:PERDITA=Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
Dialogue:PERDITA=That wear upon your virgin branches yet
Dialogue:PERDITA=Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
Dialogue:PERDITA=For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
Dialogue:PERDITA=From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
Dialogue:PERDITA=That come before the swallow dares, and take
Dialogue:PERDITA=The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
Dialogue:PERDITA=But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
Dialogue:PERDITA=Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
Dialogue:PERDITA=That die unmarried, ere they can behold
Dialogue:PERDITA=Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
Dialogue:PERDITA=Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
Dialogue:PERDITA=The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
Dialogue:PERDITA=The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,
Dialogue:PERDITA=To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
Dialogue:PERDITA=To strew him o'er and o'er!
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=What, like a corse?
Dialogue:PERDITA=No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;
Dialogue:PERDITA=Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
Dialogue:PERDITA=But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:
Dialogue:PERDITA=Methinks I play as I have seen them do
Dialogue:PERDITA=In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Dialogue:PERDITA=Does change my disposition.
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=What you do
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Nothing but that; move still, still so,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=And own no other function: each your doing,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=So singular in each particular,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=That all your acts are queens.
Dialogue:PERDITA=O Doricles,
Dialogue:PERDITA=Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
Dialogue:PERDITA=And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,
Dialogue:PERDITA=Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,
Dialogue:PERDITA=With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
Dialogue:PERDITA=You woo'd me the false way.
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=I think you have
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=As little skill to fear as I have purpose
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=That never mean to part.
Dialogue:PERDITA=I'll swear for 'em.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
Dialogue:POLIXENES=But smacks of something greater than herself,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Too noble for this place.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=He tells her something
Dialogue:CAMILLO=That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is
Dialogue:CAMILLO=The queen of curds and cream.
Dialogue:Clown=Come on, strike up!
Dialogue:DORCAS=Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,
Dialogue:DORCAS=To mend her kissing with!
Dialogue:MOPSA=Now, in good time!
Dialogue:Clown=Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
Dialogue:Clown=Come, strike up!
Notice:Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Which dances with your daughter?
Dialogue:Shepherd=They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
Dialogue:Shepherd=To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
Dialogue:Shepherd=Upon his own report and I believe it;
Dialogue:Shepherd=He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:
Dialogue:Shepherd=I think so too; for never gazed the moon
Dialogue:Shepherd=Upon the water as he'll stand and read
Dialogue:Shepherd=As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.
Dialogue:Shepherd=I think there is not half a kiss to choose
Dialogue:Shepherd=Who loves another best.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=She dances featly.
Dialogue:Shepherd=So she does any thing; though I report it,
Dialogue:Shepherd=That should be silent: if young Doricles
Dialogue:Shepherd=Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
Dialogue:Shepherd=Which he not dreams of.
Notice:Enter Servant
Dialogue:Servant=O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the
Dialogue:Servant=door, you would never dance again after a tabour and
Dialogue:Servant=pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings
Dialogue:Servant=several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he
Dialogue:Servant=utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
Dialogue:Servant=ears grew to his tunes.
Dialogue:Clown=He could never come better; he shall come in. I
Dialogue:Clown=love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
Dialogue:Clown=matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing
Dialogue:Clown=indeed and sung lamentably.
Dialogue:Servant=He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no
Dialogue:Servant=milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
Dialogue:Servant=has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without
Dialogue:Servant=bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate
Dialogue:Servant=burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
Dialogue:Servant=her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
Dialogue:Servant=as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into
Dialogue:Servant=the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me
Dialogue:Servant=no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
Dialogue:Servant='Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'
Dialogue:POLIXENES=This is a brave fellow.
Dialogue:Clown=Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
Dialogue:Clown=fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?
Dialogue:Servant=He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;
Dialogue:Servant=points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
Dialogue:Servant=learnedly handle, though they come to him by the
Dialogue:Servant=gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he
Dialogue:Servant=sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you
Dialogue:Servant=would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
Dialogue:Servant=to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.
Dialogue:Clown=Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.
Dialogue:PERDITA=Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.

Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=What maids lack from head to heel:
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.
Dialogue:Clown=If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
Dialogue:Clown=no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it
Dialogue:Clown=will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.
Dialogue:MOPSA=I was promised them against the feast; but they come
Dialogue:MOPSA=not too late now.
Dialogue:DORCAS=He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.
Dialogue:MOPSA=He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has
Dialogue:MOPSA=paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.
Dialogue:Clown=Is there no manners left among maids? will they
Dialogue:Clown=wear their plackets where they should bear their
Dialogue:Clown=faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
Dialogue:Clown=going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
Dialogue:Clown=secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
Dialogue:Clown=our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
Dialogue:Clown=your tongues, and not a word more.
Dialogue:MOPSA=I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
Dialogue:MOPSA=and a pair of sweet gloves.
Dialogue:Clown=Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
Dialogue:Clown=and lost all my money?
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=therefore it behoves men to be wary.
Dialogue:Clown=Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.
Dialogue:Clown=What hast here? ballads?
Dialogue:MOPSA=Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'
Dialogue:MOPSA=life, for then we are sure they are true.
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=toads carbonadoed.
Dialogue:MOPSA=Is it true, think you?
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Very true, and but a month old.
Dialogue:DORCAS=Bless me from marrying a usurer!
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=present. Why should I carry lies abroad?
Dialogue:MOPSA=Pray you now, buy it.
Dialogue:Clown=Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
Dialogue:Clown=ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.
Dialogue:DORCAS=Is it true too, think you?
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=my pack will hold.
Dialogue:Clown=Lay it by too: another.
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.
Dialogue:MOPSA=Let's have some merry ones.
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=request, I can tell you.
Dialogue:MOPSA=We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou
Dialogue:MOPSA=shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.
Dialogue:DORCAS=We had the tune on't a month ago.
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=occupation; have at it with you.

Dialogue:MOPSA=Thou to me thy secrets tell.
Dialogue:DORCAS=          Me too, let me go thither.
Dialogue:MOPSA=     Or thou goest to the orange or mill.
Dialogue:DORCAS=     If to either, thou dost ill.
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Neither.
Dialogue:DORCAS=       What, neither?
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Neither.
Dialogue:DORCAS=     Thou hast sworn my love to be.
Dialogue:MOPSA=     Thou hast sworn it more to me:
Dialogue:MOPSA=Then whither goest? say, whither?
Dialogue:Clown=We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
Dialogue:Clown=father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll

Dialogue:Servant=be not too rough for some that know little but
Dialogue:Servant=bowling, it will please plentifully.
Dialogue:Shepherd=Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
Dialogue:Shepherd=homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.

Dialogue:POLIXENES=How now, fair shepherd!
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Your heart is full of something that does take
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
Dialogue:POLIXENES=And handed love as you do, I was wont
Dialogue:POLIXENES=To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
Dialogue:POLIXENES=The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
Dialogue:POLIXENES=To her acceptance; you have let him go
Dialogue:POLIXENES=And nothing marted with him. If your lass
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Interpretation should abuse and call this
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
Dialogue:POLIXENES=For a reply, at least if you make a care
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Of happy holding her.
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Old sir, I know
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=She prizes not such trifles as these are:
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Up in my heart; which I have given already,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,

Dialogue:POLIXENES=Methinks a father
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
Dialogue:POLIXENES=That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Is not your father grown incapable
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
Dialogue:POLIXENES=With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?

Dialogue:CAMILLO=He will allow no speech, which I do guess
Dialogue:CAMILLO=You do not purpose to him; and as hardly

Dialogue:CAMILLO=If your more ponderous and settled project

Dialogue:CAMILLO=And bring him up to liking.
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=How, Camillo,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=May this, almost a miracle, be done?
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=That I may call thee something more than man
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=And after that trust to thee.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Have you thought on
Dialogue:CAMILLO=A place whereto you'll go?

Dialogue:CAMILLO=This follows, if you will not change your purpose
Dialogue:CAMILLO=But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=And there present yourself and your fair princess,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
Dialogue:CAMILLO=She shall be habited as it becomes

Dialogue:CAMILLO=Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
Dialogue:CAMILLO=His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,

Dialogue:CAMILLO=Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
Dialogue:CAMILLO='Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one

Dialogue:CAMILLO=The which shall point you forth at every sitting
Dialogue:CAMILLO=What you must say; that he shall not perceive
Dialogue:CAMILLO=But that you have your father's bosom there
Dialogue:CAMILLO=And speak his very heart.
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=I am bound to you:
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=There is some sap in this.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=A cause more promising
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Than a wild dedication of yourselves
Dialogue:CAMILLO=To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
Dialogue:CAMILLO=To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=But as you shake off one to take another;
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Nothing so certain as your anchors, who

Dialogue:CAMILLO=Prosperity's the very bond of love,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Affliction alters.
Dialogue:PERDITA=                  One of these is true:
Dialogue:PERDITA=I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
Dialogue:PERDITA=But not take in the mind.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Yea, say you so?
Dialogue:CAMILLO=There shall not at your father's house these
Dialogue:CAMILLO=seven years
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Be born another such.
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=My good Camillo,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=She is as forward of her breeding as
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=She is i' the rear our birth.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=I cannot say 'tis pity
Dialogue:CAMILLO=She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
Dialogue:CAMILLO=To most that teach.
Dialogue:PERDITA=Your pardon, sir; for this
Dialogue:PERDITA=I'll blush you thanks.
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=My prettiest Perdita!
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Preserver of my father, now of me,

Dialogue:FLORIZEL=We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=My lord,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Do all lie there: it shall be so my care

Dialogue:LEONTES=Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
Dialogue:LEONTES=My blemishes in them, and so still think of
Dialogue:LEONTES=The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
Dialogue:LEONTES=That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
Dialogue:LEONTES=Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
Dialogue:LEONTES=Bred his hopes out of.
Dialogue:PAULINA=True, too true, my lord:
Dialogue:PAULINA=If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Or from the all that are took something good,
Dialogue:PAULINA=To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
Dialogue:PAULINA=Would be unparallel'd.
Dialogue:LEONTES=I think so. Kill'd!
Dialogue:LEONTES=She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
Dialogue:LEONTES=Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter
Dialogue:LEONTES=Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Say so but seldom.
Dialogue:CLEOMENES=                  Not at all, good lady:
Dialogue:CLEOMENES=You might have spoken a thousand things that would
Dialogue:CLEOMENES=Have done the time more benefit and graced
Dialogue:CLEOMENES=Your kindness better.
Dialogue:PAULINA=You are one of those
Dialogue:PAULINA=Would have him wed again.
Dialogue:DION=If you would not so,
Dialogue:DION=You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
Dialogue:DION=Of his most sovereign name; consider little
Dialogue:DION=What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
Dialogue:DION=May drop upon his kingdom and devour
Dialogue:DION=Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
Dialogue:DION=Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
Dialogue:DION=What holier than, for royalty's repair,
Dialogue:DION=For present comfort and for future good,
Dialogue:DION=To bless the bed of majesty again
Dialogue:DION=With a sweet fellow to't?
Dialogue:PAULINA=There is none worthy,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
Dialogue:PAULINA=Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
Dialogue:PAULINA=For has not the divine Apollo said,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
Dialogue:PAULINA=That King Leontes shall not have an heir
Dialogue:PAULINA=Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Is all as monstrous to our human reason
Dialogue:PAULINA=As my Antigonus to break his grave
Dialogue:PAULINA=And come again to me; who, on my life,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
Dialogue:PAULINA=My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Oppose against their wills.
Notice:To LEONTES
Dialogue:PAULINA=Care not for issue;
Dialogue:PAULINA=The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
Dialogue:PAULINA=Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
Dialogue:PAULINA=Was like to be the best.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Good Paulina,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Who hast the memory of Hermione,
Dialogue:LEONTES=I know, in honour, O, that ever I
Dialogue:LEONTES=Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,
Dialogue:LEONTES=I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Have taken treasure from her lips--
Dialogue:PAULINA=And left them
Dialogue:PAULINA=More rich for what they yielded.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Thou speak'st truth.
Dialogue:LEONTES=No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
Dialogue:LEONTES=And better used, would make her sainted spirit
Dialogue:LEONTES=Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
Dialogue:LEONTES=And begin, 'Why to me?'
Dialogue:PAULINA=Had she such power,
Dialogue:PAULINA=She had just cause.
Dialogue:LEONTES=She had; and would incense me
Dialogue:LEONTES=To murder her I married.
Dialogue:PAULINA=I should so.
Dialogue:PAULINA=Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
Dialogue:PAULINA=Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
Dialogue:PAULINA=You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
Dialogue:PAULINA=Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
Dialogue:PAULINA=Should be 'Remember mine.'
Dialogue:LEONTES=Stars, stars,
Dialogue:LEONTES=And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
Dialogue:LEONTES=I'll have no wife, Paulina.
Dialogue:PAULINA=Will you swear
Dialogue:PAULINA=Never to marry but by my free leave?
Dialogue:LEONTES=Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!
Dialogue:PAULINA=Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.
Dialogue:CLEOMENES=You tempt him over-much.
Dialogue:PAULINA=Unless another,
Dialogue:PAULINA=As like Hermione as is her picture,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Affront his eye.
Dialogue:CLEOMENES=                  Good madam,--
Dialogue:PAULINA=I have done.
Dialogue:PAULINA=Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
Dialogue:PAULINA=No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
Dialogue:PAULINA=To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
Dialogue:PAULINA=As was your former; but she shall be such
Dialogue:PAULINA=As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,
Dialogue:PAULINA=it should take joy
Dialogue:PAULINA=To see her in your arms.
Dialogue:LEONTES=My true Paulina,
Dialogue:LEONTES=We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.
Dialogue:PAULINA=That
Dialogue:PAULINA=Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
Dialogue:PAULINA=Never till then.
Notice:Enter a Gentleman
Dialogue:Gentleman=One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
Dialogue:Gentleman=Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she
Dialogue:Gentleman=The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access
Dialogue:Gentleman=To your high presence.
Dialogue:LEONTES=What with him? he comes not
Dialogue:LEONTES=Like to his father's greatness: his approach,
Dialogue:LEONTES=So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
Dialogue:LEONTES='Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
Dialogue:LEONTES=By need and accident. What train?
Dialogue:Gentleman=But few,
Dialogue:Gentleman=And those but mean.
Dialogue:LEONTES=His princess, say you, with him?
Dialogue:Gentleman=Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
Dialogue:Gentleman=That e'er the sun shone bright on.
Dialogue:PAULINA=O Hermione,
Dialogue:PAULINA=As every present time doth boast itself
Dialogue:PAULINA=Above a better gone, so must thy grave
Dialogue:PAULINA=Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
Dialogue:PAULINA=Have said and writ so, but your writing now
Dialogue:PAULINA=Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
Dialogue:PAULINA=Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
Dialogue:PAULINA=To say you have seen a better.
Dialogue:Gentleman=Pardon, madam:
Dialogue:Gentleman=The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--
Dialogue:Gentleman=The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
Dialogue:Gentleman=Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
Dialogue:Gentleman=Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
Dialogue:Gentleman=Of all professors else, make proselytes
Dialogue:Gentleman=Of who she but bid follow.
Dialogue:PAULINA=How! not women?
Dialogue:Gentleman=Women will love her, that she is a woman
Dialogue:Gentleman=More worth than any man; men, that she is
Dialogue:Gentleman=The rarest of all women.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Go, Cleomenes;
Dialogue:LEONTES=Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange
Notice:Exeunt CLEOMENES and others
Dialogue:LEONTES=He thus should steal upon us.
Dialogue:PAULINA=Had our prince,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
Dialogue:PAULINA=Well with this lord: there was not full a month
Dialogue:PAULINA=Between their births.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st
Dialogue:LEONTES=He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
Dialogue:LEONTES=When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
Dialogue:LEONTES=Will bring me to consider that which may
Dialogue:LEONTES=Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
Notice:Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA
Dialogue:LEONTES=Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
Dialogue:LEONTES=For she did print your royal father off,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Your father's image is so hit in you,
Dialogue:LEONTES=His very air, that I should call you brother,
Dialogue:LEONTES=As I did him, and speak of something wildly
Dialogue:LEONTES=By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
Dialogue:LEONTES=And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
Dialogue:LEONTES=I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
Dialogue:LEONTES=Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
Dialogue:LEONTES=You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
Dialogue:LEONTES=All mine own folly--the society,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Though bearing misery, I desire my life
Dialogue:LEONTES=Once more to look on him.
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=By his command
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=His wish'd ability, he had himself
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=And those that bear them living.
Dialogue:LEONTES=O my brother,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
Dialogue:LEONTES=Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
Dialogue:LEONTES=So rarely kind, are as interpreters
Dialogue:LEONTES=Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,
Dialogue:LEONTES=As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
Dialogue:LEONTES=Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,
Dialogue:LEONTES=At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
Dialogue:LEONTES=To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
Dialogue:LEONTES=The adventure of her person?
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Good my lord,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=She came from Libya.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Where the warlike Smalus,
Dialogue:LEONTES=That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=To execute the charge my father gave me
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=For visiting your highness: my best train
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Not only my success in Libya, sir,

Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Here where we are.
Dialogue:LEONTES=                  The blessed gods
Dialogue:LEONTES=Purge all infection from our air whilst you
Dialogue:LEONTES=Do climate here! You have a holy father,
Dialogue:LEONTES=A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
Dialogue:LEONTES=So sacred as it is, I have done sin:
Dialogue:LEONTES=For which the heavens, taking angry note,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,
Dialogue:LEONTES=As he from heaven merits it, with you
Dialogue:LEONTES=Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,

Dialogue:LEONTES=Such goodly things as you!
Notice:Enter a Lord
Dialogue:Lord=Most noble sir,
Dialogue:Lord=That which I shall report will bear no credit,
Dialogue:Lord=Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
Dialogue:Lord=Bohemia greets you from himself by me;
Dialogue:Lord=Desires you to attach his son, who has--
Dialogue:Lord=His dignity and duty both cast off--
Dialogue:Lord=Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
Dialogue:Lord=A shepherd's daughter.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Where's Bohemia? speak.
Dialogue:Lord=Here in your city; I now came from him:
Dialogue:Lord=I speak amazedly; and it becomes
Dialogue:Lord=My marvel and my message. To your court
Dialogue:Lord=Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,
Dialogue:Lord=Of this fair couple, meets he on the way
Dialogue:Lord=The father of this seeming lady and
Dialogue:Lord=Her brother, having both their country quitted
Dialogue:Lord=With this young prince.
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Camillo has betray'd me;
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Whose honour and whose honesty till now
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Endured all weathers.
Dialogue:Lord=Lay't so to his charge:
Dialogue:Lord=He's with the king your father.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Who? Camillo?
Dialogue:Lord=Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now
Dialogue:Lord=Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
Dialogue:Lord=Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
Dialogue:Lord=Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
Dialogue:Lord=Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
Dialogue:Lord=With divers deaths in death.
Dialogue:PERDITA=O my poor father!
Dialogue:PERDITA=The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
Dialogue:PERDITA=Our contract celebrated.
Dialogue:LEONTES=You are married?
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=The odds for high and low's alike.
Dialogue:LEONTES=My lord,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Is this the daughter of a king?
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=She is,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=When once she is my wife.
Dialogue:LEONTES=That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
Dialogue:LEONTES=Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
Dialogue:LEONTES=Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry
Dialogue:LEONTES=Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
Dialogue:LEONTES=That you might well enjoy her.
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Dear, look up:
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Should chase us with my father, power no jot
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Remember since you owed no more to time
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Than I do now: with thought of such affections,
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=Step forth mine advocate; at your request
Dialogue:FLORIZEL=My father will grant precious things as trifles.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Which he counts but a trifle.
Dialogue:PAULINA=Sir, my liege,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
Dialogue:PAULINA='Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
Dialogue:PAULINA=Than what you look on now.
Dialogue:LEONTES=I thought of her,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Even in these looks I made.
Notice:To FLORIZEL
Dialogue:LEONTES=But your petition
Dialogue:LEONTES=Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:

Notice:Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?
Dialogue:First Gentleman=I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old
Dialogue:First Gentleman=shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
Dialogue:First Gentleman=whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all
Dialogue:First Gentleman=commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I
Dialogue:First Gentleman=heard the shepherd say, he found the child.
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=I would most gladly know the issue of it.
Dialogue:First Gentleman=I make a broken delivery of the business; but the
Dialogue:First Gentleman=changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
Dialogue:First Gentleman=very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
Dialogue:First Gentleman=staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
Dialogue:First Gentleman=eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language
Dialogue:First Gentleman=in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard
Dialogue:First Gentleman=of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
Dialogue:First Gentleman=passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
Dialogue:First Gentleman=beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not
Dialogue:First Gentleman=say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the
Dialogue:First Gentleman=extremity of the one, it must needs be.
Notice:Enter another Gentleman
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
Dialogue:First Gentleman=The news, Rogero?
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=cannot be able to express it.
Notice:Enter a third Gentleman
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=which is called true is so like an old tale, that
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=found his heir?
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=know to be his character, the majesty of the
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=and many other evidences proclaim her with all
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=the meeting of the two kings?
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=No.
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=joy crown another, so and in such manner that it
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=holding up of hands, with countenances of such
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=distraction that they were to be known by garment,
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=another encounter, which lames report to follow it
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=and undoes description to do it.
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=hence the child?
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=Like an old tale still, which will have matter to
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.
Dialogue:First Gentleman=What became of his bark and his followers?
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=instruments which aided to expose the child were
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=her husband, another elevated that the oracle was
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=of losing.
Dialogue:First Gentleman=The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
Dialogue:First Gentleman=kings and princes; for by such was it acted.
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=death, with the manner how she came to't bravely
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=confessed and lamented by the king, how
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Are they returned to the court?
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=eternity and could put breath into his work, would
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=answer: thither with all greediness of affection
Dialogue:Third Gentleman=are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=I thought she had some great matter there in hand;
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=since the death of Hermione, visited that removed
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
Dialogue:Second Gentleman=the rejoicing?
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
Dialogue:First Gentleman=every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
Dialogue:First Gentleman=our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
Dialogue:First Gentleman=Let's along.
Notice:Exeunt Gentlemen
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=so he then took her to be, who began to be much
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=weather continuing, this mystery remained
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=been the finder out of this secret, it would not
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=have relished among my other discredits.
Notice:Enter Shepherd and Clown
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Here come those I have done good to against my will,
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.
Dialogue:Shepherd=Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and
Dialogue:Shepherd=daughters will be all gentlemen born.
Dialogue:Clown=You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
Dialogue:Clown=this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
Dialogue:Clown=See you these clothes? say you see them not and
Dialogue:Clown=think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
Dialogue:Clown=these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
Dialogue:Clown=lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.
Dialogue:Clown=Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.
Dialogue:Shepherd=And so have I, boy.
Dialogue:Clown=So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
Dialogue:Clown=father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and
Dialogue:Clown=called me brother; and then the two kings called my
Dialogue:Clown=father brother; and then the prince my brother and
Dialogue:Clown=the princess my sister called my father father; and
Dialogue:Clown=so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
Dialogue:Clown=tears that ever we shed.
Dialogue:Shepherd=We may live, son, to shed many more.
Dialogue:Clown=Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
Dialogue:Clown=preposterous estate as we are.
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=faults I have committed to your worship and to give
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=me your good report to the prince my master.
Dialogue:Shepherd=Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are
Dialogue:Shepherd=gentlemen.
Dialogue:Clown=Thou wilt amend thy life?
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=Ay, an it like your good worship.
Dialogue:Clown=Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
Dialogue:Clown=art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.
Dialogue:Shepherd=You may say it, but not swear it.
Dialogue:Clown=Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
Dialogue:Clown=franklins say it, I'll swear it.
Dialogue:Shepherd=How if it be false, son?
Dialogue:Clown=If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
Dialogue:Clown=it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
Dialogue:Clown=the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
Dialogue:Clown=that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
Dialogue:Clown=tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
Dialogue:Clown=drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
Dialogue:Clown=be a tall fellow of thy hands.
Dialogue:AUTOLYCUS=I will prove so, sir, to my power.
Dialogue:Clown=Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
Dialogue:Clown=wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
Dialogue:Clown=being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings

Dialogue:PAULINA=Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Comes it not something near?
Dialogue:LEONTES=Her natural posture!
Dialogue:LEONTES=Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
Dialogue:LEONTES=Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
Dialogue:LEONTES=In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
Dialogue:LEONTES=As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
Dialogue:LEONTES=So aged as this seems.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=O, not by much.
Dialogue:PAULINA=So much the more our carver's excellence;
Dialogue:PAULINA=Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
Dialogue:PAULINA=As she lived now.
Dialogue:LEONTES=                  As now she might have done,
Dialogue:LEONTES=So much to my good comfort, as it is
Dialogue:LEONTES=Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
Dialogue:LEONTES=As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!
Dialogue:LEONTES=I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
Dialogue:LEONTES=For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
Dialogue:LEONTES=There's magic in thy majesty, which has
Dialogue:LEONTES=My evils conjured to remembrance and
Dialogue:LEONTES=From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Standing like stone with thee.
Dialogue:PERDITA=And give me leave,
Dialogue:PERDITA=And do not say 'tis superstition, that
Dialogue:PERDITA=I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
Dialogue:PERDITA=Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
Dialogue:PERDITA=Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
Dialogue:PAULINA=O, patience!
Dialogue:PAULINA=The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
Dialogue:CAMILLO=So many summers dry; scarce any joy
Dialogue:CAMILLO=Did ever so long live; no sorrow
Dialogue:CAMILLO=But kill'd itself much sooner.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Dear my brother,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Let him that was the cause of this have power
Dialogue:POLIXENES=To take off so much grief from you as he
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Will piece up in himself.
Dialogue:PAULINA=Indeed, my lord,
Dialogue:PAULINA=If I had thought the sight of my poor image
Dialogue:PAULINA=Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--
Dialogue:PAULINA=I'ld not have show'd it.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Do not draw the curtain.
Dialogue:PAULINA=No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
Dialogue:PAULINA=May think anon it moves.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Let be, let be.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
Dialogue:LEONTES=What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
Dialogue:LEONTES=Did verily bear blood?
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Masterly done:
Dialogue:POLIXENES=The very life seems warm upon her lip.
Dialogue:LEONTES=The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
Dialogue:LEONTES=As we are mock'd with art.
Dialogue:PAULINA=I'll draw the curtain:
Dialogue:PAULINA=My lord's almost so far transported that
Dialogue:PAULINA=He'll think anon it lives.
Dialogue:LEONTES=O sweet Paulina,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Make me to think so twenty years together!
Dialogue:LEONTES=No settled senses of the world can match
Dialogue:LEONTES=The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.
Dialogue:PAULINA=I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
Dialogue:PAULINA=I could afflict you farther.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Do, Paulina;
Dialogue:LEONTES=For this affliction has a taste as sweet
Dialogue:LEONTES=As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
Dialogue:LEONTES=There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
Dialogue:LEONTES=Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
Dialogue:LEONTES=For I will kiss her.
Dialogue:PAULINA=Good my lord, forbear:
Dialogue:PAULINA=The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
Dialogue:PAULINA=You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
Dialogue:PAULINA=With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
Dialogue:LEONTES=No, not these twenty years.
Dialogue:PERDITA=So long could I
Dialogue:PERDITA=Stand by, a looker on.
Dialogue:PAULINA=Either forbear,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
Dialogue:PAULINA=For more amazement. If you can behold it,
Dialogue:PAULINA=I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
Dialogue:PAULINA=And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--
Dialogue:PAULINA=Which I protest against--I am assisted
Dialogue:PAULINA=By wicked powers.
Dialogue:LEONTES=                  What you can make her do,
Dialogue:LEONTES=I am content to look on: what to speak,
Dialogue:LEONTES=I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
Dialogue:LEONTES=To make her speak as move.
Dialogue:PAULINA=It is required
Dialogue:PAULINA=You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
Dialogue:PAULINA=On: those that think it is unlawful business
Dialogue:PAULINA=I am about, let them depart.
Dialogue:LEONTES=Proceed:
Dialogue:LEONTES=No foot shall stir.
Dialogue:PAULINA=Music, awake her; strike!
Notice:Music
Dialogue:PAULINA='Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
Dialogue:PAULINA=Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
Dialogue:PAULINA=I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
Dialogue:PAULINA=Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
Notice:HERMIONE comes down
Dialogue:PAULINA=Start not; her actions shall be holy as
Dialogue:PAULINA=You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
Dialogue:PAULINA=Until you see her die again; for then
Dialogue:PAULINA=You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
Dialogue:PAULINA=When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
Dialogue:PAULINA=Is she become the suitor?
Dialogue:LEONTES=O, she's warm!
Dialogue:LEONTES=If this be magic, let it be an art
Dialogue:LEONTES=Lawful as eating.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=                  She embraces him.
Dialogue:CAMILLO=She hangs about his neck:
Dialogue:CAMILLO=If she pertain to life let her speak too.
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
Dialogue:POLIXENES=Or how stolen from the dead.
Dialogue:PAULINA=That she is living,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Were it but told you, should be hooted at
Dialogue:PAULINA=Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
Dialogue:PAULINA=Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
Dialogue:PAULINA=And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
Dialogue:PAULINA=Our Perdita is found.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=You gods, look down
Dialogue:HERMIONE=And from your sacred vials pour your graces
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
Dialogue:HERMIONE=Myself to see the issue.
Dialogue:PAULINA=There's time enough for that;
Dialogue:PAULINA=Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
Dialogue:PAULINA=Your joys with like relation. Go together,
Dialogue:PAULINA=You precious winners all; your exultation
Dialogue:PAULINA=Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
Dialogue:PAULINA=My mate, that's never to be found again,
Dialogue:PAULINA=Lament till I am lost.
Dialogue:LEONTES=O, peace, Paulina!
Dialogue:LEONTES=Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
Dialogue:LEONTES=As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
Dialogue:LEONTES=And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
Dialogue:LEONTES=But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,
Dialogue:LEONTES=As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
Dialogue:LEONTES=A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
Dialogue:LEONTES=For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee
Dialogue:LEONTES=An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
Dialogue:LEONTES=And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
Dialogue:LEONTES=Is richly noted and here justified
Dialogue:LEONTES=By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
Dialogue:LEONTES=What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,
Dialogue:LEONTES=That e'er I put between your holy looks
Dialogue:LEONTES=My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
Dialogue:LEONTES=And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
Dialogue:LEONTES=Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
Dialogue:LEONTES=Each one demand an answer to his part
Dialogue:LEONTES=Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
Dialogue:LEONTES=We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.
