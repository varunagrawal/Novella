Banner#ACT I
Banner#SCENE I. Athens. A hall in Timon's house.
Notice#Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and others, at several doors
Dialogue#Poet=Good day, sir.
Dialogue#Painter=                  I am glad you're well.
Dialogue#Poet=I have not seen you long: how goes the world?
Dialogue#Painter=It wears, sir, as it grows.
Dialogue#Poet=Ay, that's well known:
Dialogue#Poet=But what particular rarity? what strange,
Dialogue#Poet=Which manifold record not matches? See,
Dialogue#Poet=Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power
Dialogue#Poet=Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.
Dialogue#Painter=I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.
Dialogue#Merchant=O, 'tis a worthy lord.
Dialogue#Jeweller=Nay, that's most fix'd.
Dialogue#Merchant=A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,
Dialogue#Merchant=To an untirable and continuate goodness:
Dialogue#Merchant=He passes.
Dialogue#Merchant=Jeweller:	I have a jewel here--
Dialogue#Merchant=O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?
Dialogue#Merchant=Jeweller:	If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--
Dialogue#Poet=[Reciting to himself]  'When we for recompense have
Dialogue#Poet=praised the vile,
Dialogue#Poet=It stains the glory in that happy verse
Dialogue#Poet=Which aptly sings the good.'
Dialogue#Merchant='Tis a good form.
Notice#Looking at the jewel
Dialogue#Jeweller=And rich: here is a water, look ye.
Dialogue#Painter=You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication
Dialogue#Painter=To the great lord.
Dialogue#Poet=                  A thing slipp'd idly from me.
Dialogue#Poet=Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes
Dialogue#Poet=From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint
Dialogue#Poet=Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame
Dialogue#Poet=Provokes itself and like the current flies
Dialogue#Poet=Each bound it chafes. What have you there?
Dialogue#Painter=A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?
Dialogue#Poet=Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
Dialogue#Poet=Let's see your piece.
Dialogue#Painter='Tis a good piece.
Dialogue#Poet=So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.
Dialogue#Painter=Indifferent.
Dialogue#Poet=                  Admirable: how this grace
Dialogue#Poet=Speaks his own standing! what a mental power
Dialogue#Poet=This eye shoots forth! how big imagination
Dialogue#Poet=Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture
Dialogue#Poet=One might interpret.
Dialogue#Painter=It is a pretty mocking of the life.
Dialogue#Painter=Here is a touch; is't good?
Dialogue#Poet=I will say of it,
Dialogue#Poet=It tutors nature: artificial strife
Dialogue#Poet=Lives in these touches, livelier than life.
Notice#Enter certain Senators, and pass over
Dialogue#Painter=How this lord is follow'd!
Dialogue#Poet=The senators of Athens: happy man!
Dialogue#Painter=Look, more!
Dialogue#Poet=You see this confluence, this great flood
Dialogue#Poet=of visitors.
Dialogue#Poet=I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,
Dialogue#Poet=Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
Dialogue#Poet=With amplest entertainment: my free drift
Dialogue#Poet=Halts not particularly, but moves itself
Dialogue#Poet=In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice
Dialogue#Poet=Infects one comma in the course I hold;
Dialogue#Poet=But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
Dialogue#Poet=Leaving no tract behind.
Dialogue#Painter=How shall I understand you?
Dialogue#Poet=I will unbolt to you.
Dialogue#Poet=You see how all conditions, how all minds,
Dialogue#Poet=As well of glib and slippery creatures as
Dialogue#Poet=Of grave and austere quality, tender down
Dialogue#Poet=Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune
Dialogue#Poet=Upon his good and gracious nature hanging
Dialogue#Poet=Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
Dialogue#Poet=All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer
Dialogue#Poet=To Apemantus, that few things loves better
Dialogue#Poet=Than to abhor himself: even he drops down
Dialogue#Poet=The knee before him, and returns in peace
Dialogue#Poet=Most rich in Timon's nod.
Dialogue#Painter=I saw them speak together.
Dialogue#Poet=Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
Dialogue#Poet=Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount
Dialogue#Poet=Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,
Dialogue#Poet=That labour on the bosom of this sphere
Dialogue#Poet=To propagate their states: amongst them all,
Dialogue#Poet=Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,
Dialogue#Poet=One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,
Dialogue#Poet=Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;
Dialogue#Poet=Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
Dialogue#Poet=Translates his rivals.
Dialogue#Painter='Tis conceived to scope.
Dialogue#Painter=This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
Dialogue#Painter=With one man beckon'd from the rest below,
Dialogue#Painter=Bowing his head against the sleepy mount
Dialogue#Painter=To climb his happiness, would be well express'd
Dialogue#Painter=In our condition.
Dialogue#Poet=                  Nay, sir, but hear me on.
Dialogue#Poet=All those which were his fellows but of late,
Dialogue#Poet=Some better than his value, on the moment
Dialogue#Poet=Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
Dialogue#Poet=Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,
Dialogue#Poet=Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him
Dialogue#Poet=Drink the free air.
Dialogue#Painter=Ay, marry, what of these?
Dialogue#Poet=When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
Dialogue#Poet=Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants
Dialogue#Poet=Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
Dialogue#Poet=Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
Dialogue#Poet=Not one accompanying his declining foot.
Dialogue#Painter='Tis common:
Dialogue#Painter=A thousand moral paintings I can show
Dialogue#Painter=That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's
Dialogue#Painter=More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well
Dialogue#Painter=To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
Dialogue#Painter=The foot above the head.
Notice#Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself  courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from  VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other servants following
Dialogue#TIMON=Imprison'd is he, say you?
Dialogue#Messenger=Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,
Dialogue#Messenger=His means most short, his creditors most strait:
Dialogue#Messenger=Your honourable letter he desires
Dialogue#Messenger=To those have shut him up; which failing,
Dialogue#Messenger=Periods his comfort.
Dialogue#TIMON=Noble Ventidius! Well;
Dialogue#TIMON=I am not of that feather to shake off
Dialogue#TIMON=My friend when he must need me. I do know him
Dialogue#TIMON=A gentleman that well deserves a help:
Dialogue#TIMON=Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,
Dialogue#TIMON=and free him.
Dialogue#Messenger=Your lordship ever binds him.
Dialogue#TIMON=Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;
Dialogue#TIMON=And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.
Dialogue#TIMON='Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
Dialogue#TIMON=But to support him after. Fare you well.
Dialogue#Messenger=All happiness to your honour!
Notice#Exit
Notice#Enter an old Athenian
Dialogue#Old Athenian=Lord Timon, hear me speak.
Dialogue#TIMON=Freely, good father.
Dialogue#Old Athenian=Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.
Dialogue#TIMON=I have so: what of him?
Dialogue#Old Athenian=Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.
Dialogue#TIMON=Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=Here, at your lordship's service.
Dialogue#Old Athenian=This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
Dialogue#Old Athenian=By night frequents my house. I am a man
Dialogue#Old Athenian=That from my first have been inclined to thrift;
Dialogue#Old Athenian=And my estate deserves an heir more raised
Dialogue#Old Athenian=Than one which holds a trencher.
Dialogue#TIMON=Well; what further?
Dialogue#Old Athenian=One only daughter have I, no kin else,
Dialogue#Old Athenian=On whom I may confer what I have got:
Dialogue#Old Athenian=The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,
Dialogue#Old Athenian=And I have bred her at my dearest cost
Dialogue#Old Athenian=In qualities of the best. This man of thine
Dialogue#Old Athenian=Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,
Dialogue#Old Athenian=Join with me to forbid him her resort;
Dialogue#Old Athenian=Myself have spoke in vain.
Dialogue#TIMON=The man is honest.
Dialogue#Old Athenian=Therefore he will be, Timon:
Dialogue#Old Athenian=His honesty rewards him in itself;
Dialogue#Old Athenian=It must not bear my daughter.
Dialogue#TIMON=Does she love him?
Dialogue#Old Athenian=She is young and apt:
Dialogue#Old Athenian=Our own precedent passions do instruct us
Dialogue#Old Athenian=What levity's in youth.
Dialogue#TIMON=[To LUCILIUS]           Love you the maid?
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.
Dialogue#Old Athenian=If in her marriage my consent be missing,
Dialogue#Old Athenian=I call the gods to witness, I will choose
Dialogue#Old Athenian=Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
Dialogue#Old Athenian=And dispossess her all.
Dialogue#TIMON=How shall she be endow'd,
Dialogue#TIMON=if she be mated with an equal husband?
Dialogue#Old Athenian=Three talents on the present; in future, all.
Dialogue#TIMON=This gentleman of mine hath served me long:
Dialogue#TIMON=To build his fortune I will strain a little,
Dialogue#TIMON=For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:
Dialogue#TIMON=What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,
Dialogue#TIMON=And make him weigh with her.
Dialogue#Old Athenian=Most noble lord,
Dialogue#Old Athenian=Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.
Dialogue#TIMON=My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=Humbly I thank your lordship: never may
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=The state or fortune fall into my keeping,
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=Which is not owed to you!
Notice#Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian
Dialogue#Poet=Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!
Dialogue#TIMON=I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:
Dialogue#TIMON=Go not away. What have you there, my friend?
Dialogue#Painter=A piece of painting, which I do beseech
Dialogue#Painter=Your lordship to accept.
Dialogue#TIMON=Painting is welcome.
Dialogue#TIMON=The painting is almost the natural man;
Dialogue#TIMON=or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,
Dialogue#TIMON=He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are
Dialogue#TIMON=Even such as they give out. I like your work;
Dialogue#TIMON=And you shall find I like it: wait attendance
Dialogue#TIMON=Till you hear further from me.
Dialogue#Painter=The gods preserve ye!
Dialogue#TIMON=Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;
Dialogue#TIMON=We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel
Dialogue#TIMON=Hath suffer'd under praise.
Dialogue#Jeweller=What, my lord! dispraise?
Dialogue#TIMON=A more satiety of commendations.
Dialogue#TIMON=If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,
Dialogue#TIMON=It would unclew me quite.
Dialogue#Jeweller=My lord, 'tis rated
Dialogue#Jeweller=As those which sell would give: but you well know,
Dialogue#Jeweller=Things of like value differing in the owners
Dialogue#Jeweller=Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,
Dialogue#Jeweller=You mend the jewel by the wearing it.
Dialogue#TIMON=Well mock'd.
Dialogue#Merchant=No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
Dialogue#Merchant=Which all men speak with him.
Dialogue#TIMON=Look, who comes here: will you be chid?
Notice#Enter APEMANTUS
Dialogue#TIMON=Jeweller: We'll bear, with your lordship.
Dialogue#Merchant=He'll spare none.
Dialogue#TIMON=Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.
Dialogue#TIMON=Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Are they not Athenians?
Dialogue#TIMON=Yes.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Then I repent not.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Jeweller: You know me, Apemantus?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.
Dialogue#TIMON=Thou art proud, Apemantus.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
Dialogue#TIMON=Whither art going?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
Dialogue#TIMON=That's a deed thou'lt die for.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.
Dialogue#TIMON=How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=The best, for the innocence.
Dialogue#TIMON=Wrought he not well that painted it?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=He wrought better that made the painter; and yet
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=he's but a filthy piece of work.
Dialogue#Painter=You're a dog.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?
Dialogue#TIMON=Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=No; I eat not lords.
Dialogue#TIMON=An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.
Dialogue#TIMON=That's a lascivious apprehension.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.
Dialogue#TIMON=How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=man a doit.
Dialogue#TIMON=What dost thou think 'tis worth?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!
Dialogue#Poet=How now, philosopher!
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Thou liest.
Dialogue#Poet=Art not one?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Yes.
Dialogue#Poet=Then I lie not.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Art not a poet?
Dialogue#Poet=Yes.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=hast feigned him a worthy fellow.
Dialogue#Poet=That's not feigned; he is so.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!
Dialogue#TIMON=What wouldst do then, Apemantus?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=E'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.
Dialogue#TIMON=What, thyself?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Ay.
Dialogue#TIMON=Wherefore?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Art not thou a merchant?
Dialogue#Merchant=Ay, Apemantus.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!
Dialogue#Merchant=If traffic do it, the gods do it.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!
Notice#Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger
Dialogue#TIMON=What trumpet's that?
Dialogue#Messenger='Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,
Dialogue#Messenger=All of companionship.
Dialogue#TIMON=Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.
Notice#Exeunt some Attendants
Dialogue#TIMON=You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
Dialogue#TIMON=Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,
Dialogue#TIMON=Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.
Notice#Enter ALCIBIADES, with the rest
Dialogue#TIMON=Most welcome, sir!
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=                  So, so, there!
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=That there should be small love 'mongst these
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=sweet knaves,
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Into baboon and monkey.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Most hungerly on your sight.
Dialogue#TIMON=Right welcome, sir!
Dialogue#TIMON=Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time
Dialogue#TIMON=In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.
Notice#Exeunt all except APEMANTUS
Notice#Enter two Lords
Dialogue#First Lord=What time o' day is't, Apemantus?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Time to be honest.
Dialogue#First Lord=That time serves still.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Fare thee well, fare thee well.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Why, Apemantus?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=give thee none.
Dialogue#First Lord=Hang thyself!
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=requests to thy friend.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#First Lord=He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,
Dialogue#First Lord=And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes
Dialogue#First Lord=The very heart of kindness.
Dialogue#Second Lord=He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,
Dialogue#Second Lord=Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays
Dialogue#Second Lord=Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him,
Dialogue#Second Lord=But breeds the giver a return exceeding
Dialogue#Second Lord=All use of quittance.
Dialogue#First Lord=The noblest mind he carries
Dialogue#First Lord=That ever govern'd man.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?
Dialogue#First Lord=I'll keep you company.
Notice#Exeunt
Banner#SCENE II. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.
Notice#Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet  served in; FLAVIUS and others attending; then enter  TIMON, ALCIBIADES, Lords, Senators, and VENTIDIUS.  Then comes, dropping, after all, APEMANTUS, discontentedly, like himself
Dialogue#VENTIDIUS=Most honour'd Timon,
Dialogue#VENTIDIUS=It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,
Dialogue#VENTIDIUS=And call him to long peace.
Dialogue#VENTIDIUS=He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
Dialogue#VENTIDIUS=Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound
Dialogue#VENTIDIUS=To your free heart, I do return those talents,
Dialogue#VENTIDIUS=Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help
Dialogue#VENTIDIUS=I derived liberty.
Dialogue#TIMON=                  O, by no means,
Dialogue#TIMON=Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:
Dialogue#TIMON=I gave it freely ever; and there's none
Dialogue#TIMON=Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
Dialogue#TIMON=If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
Dialogue#TIMON=To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.
Dialogue#VENTIDIUS=A noble spirit!
Dialogue#TIMON=                  Nay, my lords,
Notice#They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON
Dialogue#TIMON=Ceremony was but devised at first
Dialogue#TIMON=To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,
Dialogue#TIMON=Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
Dialogue#TIMON=But where there is true friendship, there needs none.
Dialogue#TIMON=Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes
Dialogue#TIMON=Than my fortunes to me.
Notice#They sit
Dialogue#First Lord=My lord, we always have confess'd it.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?
Dialogue#TIMON=O, Apemantus, you are welcome.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=No;
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=You shall not make me welcome:
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
Dialogue#TIMON=Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there
Dialogue#TIMON=Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.
Dialogue#TIMON=They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond
Dialogue#TIMON=man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by
Dialogue#TIMON=himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is
Dialogue#TIMON=he fit for't, indeed.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=observe; I give thee warning on't.
Dialogue#TIMON=I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,
Dialogue#TIMON=therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;
Dialogue#TIMON=prithee, let my meat make thee silent.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Methinks they should invite them without knives;
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=There's much example for't; the fellow that sits
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
Dialogue#TIMON=My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Let it flow this way, my good lord.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=well. Those healths will make thee and thy state
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=look ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak to
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Apemantus' grace.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=I pray for no man but myself:
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Grant I may never prove so fond,
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=To trust man on his oath or bond;
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Or a harlot, for her weeping;
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Or a keeper with my freedom;
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Or my friends, if I should need 'em.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Amen. So fall to't:
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Rich men sin, and I eat root.
Notice#Eats and drinks
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!
Dialogue#TIMON=Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=My heart is ever at your service, my lord.
Dialogue#TIMON=You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a
Dialogue#TIMON=dinner of friends.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there's no meat
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=like 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!
Dialogue#First Lord=Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you
Dialogue#First Lord=would once use our hearts, whereby we might express
Dialogue#First Lord=some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves
Dialogue#First Lord=for ever perfect.
Dialogue#TIMON=O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods
Dialogue#TIMON=themselves have provided that I shall have much help
Dialogue#TIMON=from you: how had you been my friends else? why
Dialogue#TIMON=have you that charitable title from thousands, did
Dialogue#TIMON=not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
Dialogue#TIMON=more of you to myself than you can with modesty
Dialogue#TIMON=speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm
Dialogue#TIMON=you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any
Dialogue#TIMON=friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they
Dialogue#TIMON=were the most needless creatures living, should we
Dialogue#TIMON=ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble
Dialogue#TIMON=sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
Dialogue#TIMON=sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished
Dialogue#TIMON=myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We
Dialogue#TIMON=are born to do benefits: and what better or
Dialogue#TIMON=properer can we can our own than the riches of our
Dialogue#TIMON=friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have
Dialogue#TIMON=so many, like brothers, commanding one another's
Dialogue#TIMON=fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!
Dialogue#TIMON=Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to
Dialogue#TIMON=forget their faults, I drink to you.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Joy had the like conception in our eyes
Dialogue#Second Lord=And at that instant like a babe sprung up.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.
Dialogue#Third Lord=I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Much!
Notice#Tucket, within
Dialogue#TIMON=What means that trump?
Notice#Enter a Servant
Dialogue#TIMON=How now?
Dialogue#Servant=Please you, my lord, there are certain
Dialogue#Servant=ladies most desirous of admittance.
Dialogue#TIMON=Ladies! what are their wills?
Dialogue#Servant=There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which
Dialogue#Servant=bears that office, to signify their pleasures.
Dialogue#TIMON=I pray, let them be admitted.
Notice#Enter Cupid
Dialogue#Cupid=Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all
Dialogue#Cupid=That of his bounties taste! The five best senses
Dialogue#Cupid=Acknowledge thee their patron; and come freely
Dialogue#Cupid=To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear,
Dialogue#Cupid=Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise;
Dialogue#Cupid=They only now come but to feast thine eyes.
Dialogue#TIMON=They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance:
Dialogue#TIMON=Music, make their welcome!
Notice#Exit Cupid
Dialogue#First Lord=You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.
Notice#Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies  as Amazons, with lutes in their hands, dancing and playing
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=They dance! they are mad women.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Like madness is the glory of this life.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=And spend our flatteries, to drink those men
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Upon whose age we void it up again,
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=With poisonous spite and envy.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Of their friends' gift?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=I should fear those that dance before me now
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Would one day stamp upon me: 't has been done;
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Men shut their doors against a setting sun.
Notice#The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of  TIMON; and to show their loves, each singles out an  Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty strain or two to the hautboys, and cease

Dialogue#LUCILIUS=Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, and
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=an honourable gentleman.
Dialogue#First Stranger=We know him for no less, though we are but strangers
Dialogue#First Stranger=to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and
Dialogue#First Stranger=which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's
Dialogue#First Stranger=happy hours are done and past, and his estate
Dialogue#First Stranger=shrinks from him.
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.
Dialogue#Second Stranger=But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,
Dialogue#Second Stranger=one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow
Dialogue#Second Stranger=so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and
Dialogue#Second Stranger=showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=How!
Dialogue#Second Stranger=I tell you, denied, my lord.
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=there was very little honour showed in't. For my own
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=part, I must needs confess, I have received some
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.
Notice#Enter SERVILIUS
Dialogue#SERVILIUS=See, by good hap, yonder's my lord;

Notice#To LUCIUS
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well:
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=exquisite friend.
Dialogue#SERVILIUS=May it please your honour, my lord hath sent--
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=that lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thank
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?
Dialogue#SERVILIUS=Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;
Dialogue#SERVILIUS=requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
Dialogue#SERVILIUS=with so many talents.
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=I know his lordship is but merry with me;
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.
Dialogue#SERVILIUS=But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.
Dialogue#SERVILIUS=If his occasion were not virtuous,
Dialogue#SERVILIUS=I should not urge it half so faithfully.
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?
Dialogue#SERVILIUS=Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=against such a good time, when I might ha' shown
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=should purchase the day before for a little part,
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=before the gods, I am not able to do,--the more
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=beast, I say:--I was sending to use Lord Timon
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=because I have no power to be kind: and tell him
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=this from me, I count it one of my greatest
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?
Dialogue#SERVILIUS=Yes, sir, I shall.
Dialogue#LUCILIUS=I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.

Dialogue#Second Stranger=Ay, too well.
Dialogue#First Stranger=Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the
Dialogue#First Stranger=same piece
Dialogue#First Stranger=Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him
Dialogue#First Stranger=His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in
Dialogue#First Stranger=My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,
Dialogue#First Stranger=And kept his credit with his purse,
Dialogue#First Stranger=Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money
Dialogue#First Stranger=Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,
Dialogue#First Stranger=But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;
Dialogue#First Stranger=And yet--O, see the monstrousness of man
Dialogue#First Stranger=When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--
Dialogue#First Stranger=He does deny him, in respect of his,
Dialogue#First Stranger=What charitable men afford to beggars.
Dialogue#Third Stranger=Religion groans at it.
Dialogue#First Stranger=For mine own part,
Dialogue#First Stranger=I never tasted Timon in my life,
Dialogue#First Stranger=Nor came any of his bounties over me,
Dialogue#First Stranger=To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,
Dialogue#First Stranger=For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue
Dialogue#First Stranger=And honourable carriage,
Dialogue#First Stranger=Had his necessity made use of me,
Dialogue#First Stranger=I would have put my wealth into donation,
Dialogue#First Stranger=And the best half should have return'd to him,
Dialogue#First Stranger=So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,
Dialogue#First Stranger=Men must learn now with pity to dispense;

Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=Owe their estates unto him.
Dialogue#Servant=My lord,
Dialogue#Servant=They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for
Dialogue#Servant=They have au denied him.
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=How! have they denied him?
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=And does he send to me? Three? hum!
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=It shows but little love or judgment in him:
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=physicians,
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=But his occasion might have woo'd me first;
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=For, in my conscience, I was the first man
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=That e'er received gift from him:
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=And does he think so backwardly of me now,
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=That I'll requite its last? No:
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=So it may prove an argument of laughter
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=And with their faint reply this answer join;
Dialogue#SEMPRONIUS=Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#Servant=Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The
Dialogue#Servant=devil knew not what he did when he made man
Dialogue#Servant=politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot
Dialogue#Servant=think but, in the end, the villainies of man will
Dialogue#Servant=set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to
Dialogue#Servant=appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,
Dialogue#Servant=like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
Dialogue#Servant=whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his
Dialogue#Servant=politic love.
Dialogue#Servant=This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,
Dialogue#Servant=Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,
Dialogue#Servant=Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
Dialogue#Servant=Many a bounteous year must be employ'd

Dialogue#TITUS=For which I wait for money.
Dialogue#HORTENSIUS=It is against my heart.
Dialogue#HORTENSIUS=Lucilius' Servant	Mark, how strange it shows,
Dialogue#HORTENSIUS=Timon in this should pay more than he owes:
Dialogue#HORTENSIUS=And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,
Dialogue#HORTENSIUS=And send for money for 'em.
Dialogue#HORTENSIUS=I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:

Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,

Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=An honour in him which buys out his fault--
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=But with a noble fury and fair spirit,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=He did oppose his foe:
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=And with such sober and unnoted passion
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=As if he had but proved an argument.
Dialogue#First Senator=You undergo too strict a paradox,

Dialogue#First Senator=Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
Dialogue#First Senator=To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
Dialogue#First Senator=Upon the head of valour; which indeed

Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Such valour in the bearing, what make we
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Abroad? why then, women are more valiant
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=That stay at home, if bearing carry it,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,

Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=As you are great, be pitifully good:
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;

Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Were a sufficient briber for his life.
Dialogue#First Senator=What's that?
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=I say, my lords, he has done fair service,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=And slain in fight many of your enemies:
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=How full of valour did he bear himself
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!
Dialogue#Second Senator=He has made too much plenty with 'em;
Dialogue#Second Senator=He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often

Dialogue#Second Senator=If there were no foes, that were enough
Dialogue#Second Senator=To overcome him: in that beastly fury
Dialogue#Second Senator=He has been known to commit outrages,
Dialogue#Second Senator=And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,

Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=My honours to you, upon his good returns.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=If by this crime he owes the law his life,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=For law is strict, and war is nothing more.
Dialogue#First Senator=We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,
Dialogue#First Senator=On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,
Dialogue#First Senator=He forfeits his own blood that spills another.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,

Dialogue#First Lord=Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.
Dialogue#Second Lord=The swallow follows not summer more willing than we
Dialogue#Second Lord=your lordship.
Dialogue#TIMON=[Aside]  Nor more willingly leaves winter; such
Dialogue#TIMON=summer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not
Dialogue#TIMON=recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the
Dialogue#TIMON=music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' the
Dialogue#TIMON=trumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently.
Dialogue#First Lord=I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship
Dialogue#First Lord=that I returned you an empty messenger.
Dialogue#TIMON=O, sir, let it not trouble you.
Dialogue#Second Lord=My noble lord,--
Dialogue#TIMON=Ah, my good friend, what cheer?
Dialogue#Second Lord=My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,
Dialogue#Second Lord=that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,
Dialogue#Second Lord=I was so unfortunate a beggar.
Dialogue#TIMON=Think not on 't, sir.
Dialogue#Second Lord=If you had sent but two hours before,--
Dialogue#TIMON=Let it not cumber your better remembrance.
Notice#The banquet brought in
Dialogue#TIMON=Come, bring in all together.
Dialogue#Second Lord=All covered dishes!

Dialogue#Third Lord=Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?
Dialogue#Second Lord=Alcibiades banished!
Dialogue#Third Lord='Tis so, be sure of it.
Dialogue#First Lord=How! how!
Dialogue#Second Lord=I pray you, upon what?
Dialogue#TIMON=My worthy friends, will you draw near?
Dialogue#Third Lord=I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.
Dialogue#Second Lord=This is the old man still.
Dialogue#Third Lord=Will 't hold? will 't hold?
Dialogue#Second Lord=It does: but time will--and so--
Dialogue#Third Lord=I do conceive.
Dialogue#TIMON=Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to
Dialogue#TIMON=the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all
Dialogue#TIMON=places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let
Dialogue#TIMON=the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:
Dialogue#TIMON=sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
Dialogue#TIMON=You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with
Dialogue#TIMON=thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves
Dialogue#TIMON=praised: but reserve still to give, lest your
Dialogue#TIMON=deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that
Dialogue#TIMON=one need not lend to another; for, were your
Dialogue#TIMON=godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the
Dialogue#TIMON=gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man
Dialogue#TIMON=that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without
Dialogue#TIMON=a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at
Dialogue#TIMON=the table, let a dozen of them be--as they are. The
Dialogue#TIMON=rest of your fees, O gods--the senators of Athens,
Dialogue#TIMON=together with the common lag of people--what is
Dialogue#TIMON=amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for
Dialogue#TIMON=destruction. For these my present friends, as they

Dialogue#TIMON=nothing are they welcome.
Dialogue#TIMON=Uncover, dogs, and lap.

Dialogue#Some Speak=What does his lordship mean?
Dialogue#Some Others=I know not.
Dialogue#TIMON=May you a better feast never behold,
Dialogue#TIMON=You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water
Dialogue#TIMON=Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;
Dialogue#TIMON=Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,
Dialogue#TIMON=Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces
Dialogue#TIMON=Your reeking villany.
Notice#Throwing the water in their faces
Dialogue#TIMON=Live loathed and long,
Dialogue#TIMON=Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,
Dialogue#TIMON=Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,
Dialogue#TIMON=You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,
Dialogue#TIMON=Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!
Dialogue#TIMON=Of man and beast the infinite malady
Dialogue#TIMON=Crust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go?
Dialogue#TIMON=Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou;--
Dialogue#TIMON=Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.
Notice#Throws the dishes at them, and drives them out
Dialogue#TIMON=What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,

Dialogue#TIMON=Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,
Dialogue#TIMON=That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,
Dialogue#TIMON=And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!
Dialogue#TIMON=Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,
Dialogue#TIMON=Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,
Dialogue#TIMON=And minister in their steads! to general filths
Dialogue#TIMON=Convert o' the instant, green virginity,
Dialogue#TIMON=Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;
Dialogue#TIMON=Rather than render back, out with your knives,
Dialogue#TIMON=And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!
Dialogue#TIMON=Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,
Dialogue#TIMON=And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;
Dialogue#TIMON=Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,
Dialogue#TIMON=pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,
Dialogue#TIMON=With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,
Dialogue#TIMON=Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
Dialogue#TIMON=Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,
Dialogue#TIMON=Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
Dialogue#TIMON=Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,
Dialogue#TIMON=Decline to your confounding contraries,
Dialogue#TIMON=And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men,
Dialogue#TIMON=Your potent and infectious fevers heap
Dialogue#TIMON=On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,
Dialogue#TIMON=Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
Dialogue#TIMON=As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty
Dialogue#TIMON=Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,
Dialogue#TIMON=That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,
Dialogue#TIMON=And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,
Dialogue#TIMON=Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop
Dialogue#TIMON=Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,
Dialogue#TIMON=at their society, as their friendship, may
Dialogue#TIMON=merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,
Dialogue#TIMON=But nakedness, thou detestable town!
Dialogue#TIMON=Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
Dialogue#TIMON=Timon will to the woods; where he shall find
Dialogue#TIMON=The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
Dialogue#TIMON=The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--
Dialogue#TIMON=The Athenians both within and out that wall!
Dialogue#TIMON=And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
Dialogue#TIMON=To the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.

Dialogue#First Servant=Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=I am as poor as you.
Dialogue#First Servant=Such a house broke!
Dialogue#First Servant=So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not
Dialogue#First Servant=One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
Dialogue#First Servant=And go along with him!
Dialogue#Second Servant=As we do turn our backs
Dialogue#Second Servant=From our companion thrown into his grave,
Dialogue#Second Servant=So his familiars to his buried fortunes
Dialogue#Second Servant=Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,
Dialogue#Second Servant=Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,
Dialogue#Second Servant=A dedicated beggar to the air,
Dialogue#Second Servant=With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,
Dialogue#Second Servant=Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.

Dialogue#FLAVIUS=All broken implements of a ruin'd house.
Dialogue#Third Servant=Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;

Dialogue#Third Servant=And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
Dialogue#Third Servant=Hearing the surges threat: we must all part
Dialogue#Third Servant=Into this sea of air.
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Good fellows all,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS='We have seen better days.' Let each take some;
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.
Notice#Servants embrace, and part several ways
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Since riches point to misery and contempt?
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=But in a dream of friendship?
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=To have his pomp and all what state compounds
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Supply his life, or that which can command it.
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=I'll follow and inquire him out:

Dialogue#FLAVIUS=O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Whose procreation, residence, and birth,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=But by contempt of nature.
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=The beggar native honour.
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=In purity of manhood stand upright,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=So are they all; for every grise of fortune
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=There's nothing level in our cursed natures,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:

Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=This yellow slave
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=And give them title, knee and approbation

Dialogue#FLAVIUS=She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores

Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=What art thou there? speak.
Dialogue#TIMON=A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,
Dialogue#TIMON=For showing me again the eyes of man!
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=That art thyself a man?
Dialogue#TIMON=I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
Dialogue#TIMON=For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,
Dialogue#TIMON=That I might love thee something.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=I know thee well;
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.
Dialogue#TIMON=I know thee too; and more than that I know thee,
Dialogue#TIMON=I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;
Dialogue#TIMON=With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules:
Dialogue#TIMON=Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;
Dialogue#TIMON=Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine
Dialogue#TIMON=Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,
Dialogue#TIMON=For all her cherubim look.
Dialogue#PHRYNIA=Thy lips rot off!
Dialogue#TIMON=I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
Dialogue#TIMON=To thine own lips again.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=How came the noble Timon to this change?
Dialogue#TIMON=As the moon does, by wanting light to give:
Dialogue#TIMON=But then renew I could not, like the moon;
Dialogue#TIMON=There were no suns to borrow of.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Noble Timon,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=What friendship may I do thee?
Dialogue#TIMON=None, but to
Dialogue#TIMON=Maintain my opinion.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=What is it, Timon?
Dialogue#TIMON=Promise me friendship, but perform none: if thou
Dialogue#TIMON=wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art
Dialogue#TIMON=a man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, for
Dialogue#TIMON=thou art a man!
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.
Dialogue#TIMON=Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=I see them now; then was a blessed time.
Dialogue#TIMON=As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.
Dialogue#TIMANDRA=Is this the Athenian minion, whom the world
Dialogue#TIMANDRA=Voiced so regardfully?
Dialogue#TIMON=Art thou Timandra?
Dialogue#TIMANDRA=Yes.
Dialogue#TIMON=Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;
Dialogue#TIMON=Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.
Dialogue#TIMON=Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves
Dialogue#TIMON=For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth
Dialogue#TIMON=To the tub-fast and the diet.
Dialogue#TIMANDRA=Hang thee, monster!
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his wits
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=The want whereof doth daily make revolt
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=In my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,--
Dialogue#TIMON=I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.
Dialogue#TIMON=How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
Dialogue#TIMON=I had rather be alone.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Why, fare thee well:
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Here is some gold for thee.
Dialogue#TIMON=Keep it, I cannot eat it.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=When I have laid proud Athens on a heap,--
Dialogue#TIMON=Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Ay, Timon, and have cause.
Dialogue#TIMON=The gods confound them all in thy conquest;
Dialogue#TIMON=And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Why me, Timon?
Dialogue#TIMON=                  That, by killing of villains,
Dialogue#TIMON=Thou wast born to conquer my country.
Dialogue#TIMON=Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on;
Dialogue#TIMON=Be as a planetary plague, when Jove
Dialogue#TIMON=Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison
Dialogue#TIMON=In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:
Dialogue#TIMON=Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;
Dialogue#TIMON=He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;
Dialogue#TIMON=It is her habit only that is honest,
Dialogue#TIMON=Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek
Dialogue#TIMON=Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,
Dialogue#TIMON=That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,
Dialogue#TIMON=Are not within the leaf of pity writ,
Dialogue#TIMON=But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,
Dialogue#TIMON=Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;
Dialogue#TIMON=Think it a bastard, whom the oracle
Dialogue#TIMON=Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
Dialogue#TIMON=And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;
Dialogue#TIMON=Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;
Dialogue#TIMON=Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
Dialogue#TIMON=Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,
Dialogue#TIMON=Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers:
Dialogue#TIMON=Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,
Dialogue#TIMON=Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=givest me,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Not all thy counsel.
Dialogue#TIMON=Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse
Dialogue#TIMON=upon thee!
Dialogue#TIMANDRA=Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou more?
Dialogue#TIMON=Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,
Dialogue#TIMON=And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,
Dialogue#TIMON=Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,
Dialogue#TIMON=Although, I know, you 'll swear, terribly swear
Dialogue#TIMON=Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
Dialogue#TIMON=The immortal gods that hear you,--spare your oaths,
Dialogue#TIMON=I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still;
Dialogue#TIMON=And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,
Dialogue#TIMON=Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;
Dialogue#TIMON=Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
Dialogue#TIMON=And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,
Dialogue#TIMON=Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs
Dialogue#TIMON=With burthens of the dead;--some that were hang'd,
Dialogue#TIMON=No matter:--wear them, betray with them: whore still;
Dialogue#TIMON=Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,
Dialogue#TIMON=A pox of wrinkles!
Dialogue#TIMANDRA=Well, more gold: what then?
Dialogue#TIMANDRA=Believe't, that we'll do any thing for gold.
Dialogue#TIMON=Consumptions sow
Dialogue#TIMON=In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,
Dialogue#TIMON=And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,
Dialogue#TIMON=That he may never more false title plead,
Dialogue#TIMON=Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,
Dialogue#TIMON=That scolds against the quality of flesh,
Dialogue#TIMON=And not believes himself: down with the nose,
Dialogue#TIMON=Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away
Dialogue#TIMON=Of him that, his particular to foresee,
Dialogue#TIMON=Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pate
Dialogue#TIMON=ruffians bald;
Dialogue#TIMON=And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
Dialogue#TIMON=Derive some pain from you: plague all;
Dialogue#TIMON=That your activity may defeat and quell
Dialogue#TIMON=The source of all erection. There's more gold:
Dialogue#TIMON=Do you damn others, and let this damn you,
Dialogue#TIMON=And ditches grave you all!
Dialogue#TIMANDRA=More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.
Dialogue#TIMON=More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell, Timon:
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.
Dialogue#TIMON=If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=I never did thee harm.
Dialogue#TIMON=Yes, thou spokest well of me.

Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=We but offend him. Strike!

Dialogue#TIMON=Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=This is in thee a nature but infected;
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot

Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Dost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again,
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Outlives encertain pomp, is crown'd before:
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=The one is filling still, never complete;
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Worse than the worst, content.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.
Dialogue#TIMON=Not by his breath that is more miserable.
Dialogue#TIMON=Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm
Dialogue#TIMON=With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.
Dialogue#TIMON=Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded
Dialogue#TIMON=The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
Dialogue#TIMON=To such as may the passive drugs of it
Dialogue#TIMON=Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself
Dialogue#TIMON=In general riot; melted down thy youth
Dialogue#TIMON=In different beds of lust; and never learn'd
Dialogue#TIMON=The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd
Dialogue#TIMON=The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,
Dialogue#TIMON=Who had the world as my confectionary,
Dialogue#TIMON=The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men
Dialogue#TIMON=At duty, more than I could frame employment,
Dialogue#TIMON=That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
Dialogue#TIMON=Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush
Dialogue#TIMON=Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare
Dialogue#TIMON=For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,
Dialogue#TIMON=That never knew but better, is some burden:
Dialogue#TIMON=Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time
Dialogue#TIMON=Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
Dialogue#TIMON=They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?
Dialogue#TIMON=If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
Dialogue#TIMON=Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff
Dialogue#TIMON=To some she beggar and compounded thee
Dialogue#TIMON=Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!
Dialogue#TIMON=If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,
Dialogue#TIMON=Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Art thou proud yet?
Dialogue#TIMON=Ay, that I am not thee.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=I, that I was
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=No prodigal.
Dialogue#TIMON=                  I, that I am one now:
Dialogue#TIMON=Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,
Dialogue#TIMON=I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.

Dialogue#TIMON=Thus would I eat it.

Dialogue#TIMON=Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
Dialogue#TIMON=Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Here is no use for gold.
Dialogue#TIMON=The best and truest;
Dialogue#TIMON=For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Where liest o' nights, Timon?
Dialogue#TIMON=Under that's above me.
Dialogue#TIMON=Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Where my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I eat
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=it.
Dialogue#TIMON=Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Where wouldst thou send it?
Dialogue#TIMON=To sauce thy dishes.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but art
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=thee, eat it.
Dialogue#TIMON=On what I hate I feed not.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Dost hate a medlar?
Dialogue#TIMON=Ay, though it look like thee.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldst
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?
Dialogue#TIMON=Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst thou
Dialogue#TIMON=ever know beloved?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Myself.
Dialogue#TIMON=I understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep a
Dialogue#TIMON=dog.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=What things in the world canst thou nearest compare
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=to thy flatterers?
Dialogue#TIMON=Women nearest; but men, men are the things
Dialogue#TIMON=themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,
Dialogue#TIMON=Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.
Dialogue#TIMON=Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of
Dialogue#TIMON=men, and remain a beast with the beasts?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Ay, Timon.
Dialogue#TIMON=A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t'
Dialogue#TIMON=attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would
Dialogue#TIMON=beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would
Dialogue#TIMON=eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would
Dialogue#TIMON=suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by
Dialogue#TIMON=the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would
Dialogue#TIMON=torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a
Dialogue#TIMON=breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy
Dialogue#TIMON=greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst
Dialogue#TIMON=hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the
Dialogue#TIMON=unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and
Dialogue#TIMON=make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert
Dialogue#TIMON=thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse:
Dialogue#TIMON=wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the
Dialogue#TIMON=leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to
Dialogue#TIMON=the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
Dialogue#TIMON=thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy
Dialogue#TIMON=defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that
Dialogue#TIMON=were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art
Dialogue#TIMON=thou already, that seest not thy loss in
Dialogue#TIMON=transformation!
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=mightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth of
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Athens is become a forest of beasts.
Dialogue#TIMON=How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=and give way: when I know not what else to do, I'll
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=see thee again.
Dialogue#TIMON=When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be
Dialogue#TIMON=welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.
Dialogue#TIMON=Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.
Dialogue#TIMON=All villains that do stand by thee are pure.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.
Dialogue#TIMON=If I name thee.
Dialogue#TIMON=I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=I would my tongue could rot them off!
Dialogue#TIMON=Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!
Dialogue#TIMON=Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
Dialogue#TIMON=I swound to see thee.
Dialogue#APEMANTUS=Would thou wouldst burst!
Dialogue#TIMON=Away,

Dialogue#TIMON=Rogue, rogue, rogue!
Dialogue#TIMON=I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
Dialogue#TIMON=But even the mere necessities upon 't.
Dialogue#TIMON=Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
Dialogue#TIMON=Lie where the light foam the sea may beat
Dialogue#TIMON=Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,
Dialogue#TIMON=That death in me at others' lives may laugh.

Dialogue#First Bandit=Where should he have this gold? It is some poor

Dialogue#Second Bandit=It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.
Dialogue#Third Bandit=Let us make the assay upon him: if he care not

Dialogue#Banditti=Where?
Dialogue#Second Bandit='Tis his description.
Dialogue#Third Bandit=He; I know him.
Dialogue#Banditti=Save thee, Timon.
Dialogue#TIMON=Now, thieves?
Dialogue#Banditti=Soldiers, not thieves.
Dialogue#TIMON=Both too; and women's sons.
Dialogue#Banditti=We are not thieves, but men that much do want.
Dialogue#TIMON=Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.
Dialogue#TIMON=Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;
Dialogue#TIMON=Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
Dialogue#TIMON=The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;

Dialogue#First Bandit=We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,
Dialogue#First Bandit=As beasts and birds and fishes.
Dialogue#TIMON=Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;
Dialogue#TIMON=You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
Dialogue#TIMON=That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not
Dialogue#TIMON=In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft
Dialogue#TIMON=In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
Dialogue#TIMON=Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,
Dialogue#TIMON=Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
Dialogue#TIMON=And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;
Dialogue#TIMON=His antidotes are poison, and he slays
Dialogue#TIMON=Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;
Dialogue#TIMON=Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,
Dialogue#TIMON=Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.
Dialogue#TIMON=The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
Dialogue#TIMON=Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
Dialogue#TIMON=And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:
Dialogue#TIMON=The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
Dialogue#TIMON=The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,
Dialogue#TIMON=That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
Dialogue#TIMON=From general excrement: each thing's a thief:
Dialogue#TIMON=The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
Dialogue#TIMON=Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,
Dialogue#TIMON=Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
Dialogue#TIMON=All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,

Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=When man was wish'd to love his enemies!

Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!
Dialogue#TIMON=Away! what art thou?
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Have you forgot me, sir?
Dialogue#TIMON=Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;
Dialogue#TIMON=Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=An honest poor servant of yours.
Dialogue#TIMON=Then I know thee not:
Dialogue#TIMON=I never had honest man about me, I; all
Dialogue#TIMON=I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=The gods are witness,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.
Dialogue#TIMON=What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I
Dialogue#TIMON=love thee,
Dialogue#TIMON=Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st
Dialogue#TIMON=Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give
Dialogue#TIMON=But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:
Dialogue#TIMON=Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=I beg of you to know me, good my lord,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=To entertain me as your steward still.
Dialogue#TIMON=Had I a steward
Dialogue#TIMON=So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
Dialogue#TIMON=It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
Dialogue#TIMON=Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man
Dialogue#TIMON=Was born of woman.
Dialogue#TIMON=Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
Dialogue#TIMON=You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim
Dialogue#TIMON=One honest man--mistake me not--but one;
Dialogue#TIMON=No more, I pray,--and he's a steward.
Dialogue#TIMON=How fain would I have hated all mankind!
Dialogue#TIMON=And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,
Dialogue#TIMON=I fell with curses.
Dialogue#TIMON=Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
Dialogue#TIMON=For, by oppressing and betraying me,
Dialogue#TIMON=Thou mightst have sooner got another service:
Dialogue#TIMON=For many so arrive at second masters,
Dialogue#TIMON=Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--
Dialogue#TIMON=For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--
Dialogue#TIMON=Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,
Dialogue#TIMON=If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,
Dialogue#TIMON=Expecting in return twenty for one?
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=No, my most worthy master; in whose breast
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,

Dialogue#FLAVIUS=My most honour'd lord,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=For any benefit that points to me,
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=For this one wish, that you had power and wealth

Dialogue#TIMON=Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,
Dialogue#TIMON=Here, take: the gods out of my misery
Dialogue#TIMON=Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;
Dialogue#TIMON=But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;
Dialogue#TIMON=Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
Dialogue#TIMON=But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,
Dialogue#TIMON=Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs
Dialogue#TIMON=What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,
Dialogue#TIMON=Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like

Dialogue#Painter=As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where
Dialogue#Painter=he abides.
Dialogue#Poet=What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold
Dialogue#Poet=for true, that he's so full of gold?
Dialogue#Painter=Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and
Dialogue#Painter=Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor
Dialogue#Painter=straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said
Dialogue#Painter=he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.
Dialogue#Poet=Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.
Dialogue#Painter=Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens
Dialogue#Painter=again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore
Dialogue#Painter='tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this
Dialogue#Painter=supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in
Dialogue#Painter=us; and is very likely to load our purposes with
Dialogue#Painter=what they travail for, if it be a just true report
Dialogue#Painter=that goes of his having.
Dialogue#Poet=What have you now to present unto him?
Dialogue#Painter=Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will
Dialogue#Painter=promise him an excellent piece.
Dialogue#Poet=I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent
Dialogue#Poet=that's coming toward him.
Dialogue#Painter=Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the
Dialogue#Painter=time: it opens the eyes of expectation:
Dialogue#Painter=performance is ever the duller for his act; and,
Dialogue#Painter=but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the
Dialogue#Painter=deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is
Dialogue#Painter=most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind
Dialogue#Painter=of will or testament which argues a great sickness
Dialogue#Painter=in his judgment that makes it.

Dialogue#TIMON=[Aside]  Excellent workman! thou canst not paint a
Dialogue#TIMON=man so bad as is thyself.

Dialogue#TIMON=[Aside]  Must thou needs stand for a villain in
Dialogue#TIMON=thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in

Dialogue#Both=Name them, my lord, let's know them.
Dialogue#TIMON=You that way and you this, but two in company;
Dialogue#TIMON=Each man apart, all single and alone,
Dialogue#TIMON=Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.
Dialogue#TIMON=If where thou art two villains shall not be,

Dialogue#Second Senator=They confess
Dialogue#Second Senator=Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross:
Dialogue#Second Senator=Which now the public body, which doth seldom
Dialogue#Second Senator=Play the recanter, feeling in itself
Dialogue#Second Senator=A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
Dialogue#Second Senator=Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;
Dialogue#Second Senator=And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,
Dialogue#Second Senator=Together with a recompense more fruitful
Dialogue#Second Senator=Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
Dialogue#Second Senator=Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
Dialogue#Second Senator=As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
Dialogue#Second Senator=And write in thee the figures of their love,
Dialogue#Second Senator=Ever to read them thine.
Dialogue#TIMON=You witch me in it;
Dialogue#TIMON=Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
Dialogue#TIMON=Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,
Dialogue#TIMON=And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.
Dialogue#First Senator=Therefore, so please thee to return with us
Dialogue#First Senator=And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take
Dialogue#First Senator=The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,
Dialogue#First Senator=Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name
Dialogue#First Senator=Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back
Dialogue#First Senator=Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,
Dialogue#First Senator=Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up
Dialogue#First Senator=His country's peace.
Dialogue#Second Senator=And shakes his threatening sword
Dialogue#Second Senator=Against the walls of Athens.
Dialogue#First Senator=Therefore, Timon,--
Dialogue#TIMON=Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:
Dialogue#TIMON=If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,
Dialogue#TIMON=Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,
Dialogue#TIMON=That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,
Dialogue#TIMON=And take our goodly aged men by the beards,
Dialogue#TIMON=Giving our holy virgins to the stain
Dialogue#TIMON=Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,
Dialogue#TIMON=Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,
Dialogue#TIMON=In pity of our aged and our youth,
Dialogue#TIMON=I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,
Dialogue#TIMON=And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,
Dialogue#TIMON=While you have throats to answer: for myself,
Dialogue#TIMON=There's not a whittle in the unruly camp
Dialogue#TIMON=But I do prize it at my love before
Dialogue#TIMON=The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you
Dialogue#TIMON=To the protection of the prosperous gods,
Dialogue#TIMON=As thieves to keepers.
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Stay not, all's in vain.
Dialogue#TIMON=Why, I was writing of my epitaph;
Dialogue#TIMON=it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness
Dialogue#TIMON=Of health and living now begins to mend,
Dialogue#TIMON=And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;
Dialogue#TIMON=Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,
Dialogue#TIMON=And last so long enough!
Dialogue#First Senator=We speak in vain.
Dialogue#TIMON=But yet I love my country, and am not
Dialogue#TIMON=One that rejoices in the common wreck,
Dialogue#TIMON=As common bruit doth put it.
Dialogue#First Senator=That's well spoke.
Dialogue#TIMON=Commend me to my loving countrymen,--
Dialogue#First Senator=These words become your lips as they pass
Dialogue#First Senator=thorough them.
Dialogue#Second Senator=And enter in our ears like great triumphers
Dialogue#Second Senator=In their applauding gates.
Dialogue#TIMON=Commend me to them,
Dialogue#TIMON=And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,
Dialogue#TIMON=Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,
Dialogue#TIMON=Their pangs of love, with other incident throes
Dialogue#TIMON=That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
Dialogue#TIMON=In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:
Dialogue#TIMON=I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.
Dialogue#First Senator=I like this well; he will return again.
Dialogue#TIMON=I have a tree, which grows here in my close,
Dialogue#TIMON=That mine own use invites me to cut down,
Dialogue#TIMON=And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,
Dialogue#TIMON=Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree
Dialogue#TIMON=From high to low throughout, that whoso please
Dialogue#TIMON=To stop affliction, let him take his haste,
Dialogue#TIMON=Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,
Dialogue#TIMON=And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.
Dialogue#FLAVIUS=Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.
Dialogue#TIMON=Come not to me again: but say to Athens,
Dialogue#TIMON=Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
Dialogue#TIMON=Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;
Dialogue#TIMON=Who once a day with his embossed froth
Dialogue#TIMON=The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,
Dialogue#TIMON=And let my grave-stone be your oracle.
Dialogue#TIMON=Lips, let sour words go by and language end:
Dialogue#TIMON=What is amiss plague and infection mend!
Dialogue#TIMON=Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
Dialogue#TIMON=Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.
Notice#Retires to his cave
Dialogue#First Senator=His discontents are unremoveably
Dialogue#First Senator=Coupled to nature.
Dialogue#Second Senator=Our hope in him is dead: let us return,
Dialogue#Second Senator=And strain what other means is left unto us
Dialogue#Second Senator=In our dear peril.
Dialogue#First Senator=                  It requires swift foot.
Notice#Exeunt
Banner#SCENE II. Before the walls of Athens.
Notice#Enter two Senators and a Messenger
Dialogue#First Senator=Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files
Dialogue#First Senator=As full as thy report?
Dialogue#Messenger=have spoke the least:
Dialogue#Messenger=Besides, his expedition promises
Dialogue#Messenger=Present approach.
Dialogue#Second Senator=We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.
Dialogue#Messenger=I met a courier, one mine ancient friend;
Dialogue#Messenger=Whom, though in general part we were opposed,
Dialogue#Messenger=Yet our old love made a particular force,
Dialogue#Messenger=And made us speak like friends: this man was riding
Dialogue#Messenger=From Alcibiades to Timon's cave,
Dialogue#Messenger=With letters of entreaty, which imported
Dialogue#Messenger=His fellowship i' the cause against your city,
Dialogue#Messenger=In part for his sake moved.
Dialogue#First Senator=Here come our brothers.
Notice#Enter the Senators from TIMON
Dialogue#Third Senator=No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.
Dialogue#Third Senator=The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring
Dialogue#Third Senator=Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:
Dialogue#Third Senator=Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.
Notice#Exeunt
Banner#SCENE III. The woods. Timon's cave, and a rude tomb seen.
Notice#Enter a Soldier, seeking TIMON
Dialogue#Soldier=By all description this should be the place.
Dialogue#Soldier=Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this?
Dialogue#Soldier=Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:
Dialogue#Soldier=Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man.
Dialogue#Soldier=Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb
Dialogue#Soldier=I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:
Dialogue#Soldier=Our captain hath in every figure skill,
Dialogue#Soldier=An aged interpreter, though young in days:
Dialogue#Soldier=Before proud Athens he's set down by this,
Dialogue#Soldier=Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.
Notice#Exit
Banner#SCENE IV. Before the walls of Athens.
Notice#Trumpets sound. Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Sound to this coward and lascivious town
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Our terrible approach.
Notice#A parley sounded
Notice#Enter Senators on the walls
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=With all licentious measure, making your wills
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=The scope of justice; till now myself and such
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=As slept within the shadow of your power
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Hav e wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=When crouching marrow in the bearer strong
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=And pursy insolence shall break his wind
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=With fear and horrid flight.
Dialogue#First Senator=Noble and young,
Dialogue#First Senator=When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,
Dialogue#First Senator=Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,
Dialogue#First Senator=We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,
Dialogue#First Senator=To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
Dialogue#First Senator=Above their quantity.
Dialogue#Second Senator=So did we woo
Dialogue#Second Senator=Transformed Timon to our city's love
Dialogue#Second Senator=By humble message and by promised means:
Dialogue#Second Senator=We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
Dialogue#Second Senator=The common stroke of war.
Dialogue#First Senator=These walls of ours
Dialogue#First Senator=Were not erected by their hands from whom
Dialogue#First Senator=You have received your griefs; nor are they such
Dialogue#First Senator=That these great towers, trophies and schools
Dialogue#First Senator=should fall
Dialogue#First Senator=For private faults in them.
Dialogue#Second Senator=Nor are they living
Dialogue#Second Senator=Who were the motives that you first went out;
Dialogue#Second Senator=Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess
Dialogue#Second Senator=Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,
Dialogue#Second Senator=Into our city with thy banners spread:
Dialogue#Second Senator=By decimation, and a tithed death--
Dialogue#Second Senator=If thy revenges hunger for that food
Dialogue#Second Senator=Which nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth,
Dialogue#Second Senator=And by the hazard of the spotted die
Dialogue#Second Senator=Let die the spotted.
Dialogue#First Senator=All have not offended;
Dialogue#First Senator=For those that were, it is not square to take
Dialogue#First Senator=On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
Dialogue#First Senator=Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,
Dialogue#First Senator=Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:
Dialogue#First Senator=Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
Dialogue#First Senator=Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
Dialogue#First Senator=With those that have offended: like a shepherd,
Dialogue#First Senator=Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,
Dialogue#First Senator=But kill not all together.
Dialogue#Second Senator=What thou wilt,
Dialogue#Second Senator=Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
Dialogue#Second Senator=Than hew to't with thy sword.
Dialogue#First Senator =Set but thy foot
Dialogue#First Senator =Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope;
Dialogue#First Senator =So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,
Dialogue#First Senator =To say thou'lt enter friendly.
Dialogue#Second Senator=Throw thy glove,
Dialogue#Second Senator=Or any token of thine honour else,
Dialogue#Second Senator=That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
Dialogue#Second Senator=And not as our confusion, all thy powers
Dialogue#Second Senator=Shall make their harbour in our town, till we
Dialogue#Second Senator=Have seal'd thy full desire.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Then there's my glove;
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Descend, and open your uncharged ports:
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=With my more noble meaning, not a man
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Of regular justice in your city's bounds,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=But shall be render'd to your public laws
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=At heaviest answer.
Dialogue#Both='Tis most nobly spoken.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Descend, and keep your words.
Notice#The Senators descend, and open the gates
Notice#Enter Soldier
Dialogue#Soldier=My noble general, Timon is dead;
Dialogue#Soldier=Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;
Dialogue#Soldier=And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which
Dialogue#Soldier=With wax I brought away, whose soft impression
Dialogue#Soldier=Interprets for my poor ignorance.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=[Reads the epitaph]  'Here lies a
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=caitiffs left!
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=not here thy gait.'
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=These well express in thee thy latter spirits:
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=droplets which
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Is noble Timon: of whose memory
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=And I will use the olive with my sword,
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
Dialogue#ALCIBIADES=Let our drums strike.
