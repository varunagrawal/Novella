Banner#SCENE I. Rome. A street.
Notice#Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons
Dialogue#First Citizen=Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
Dialogue#All=Speak, speak.
Dialogue#First Citizen=You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
Dialogue#All=Resolved. resolved.
Dialogue#First Citizen=First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
Dialogue#All=We know't, we know't.
Dialogue#First Citizen=Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
Dialogue#First Citizen=Is't a verdict?
Dialogue#All=No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!
Dialogue#Second Citizen=One word, good citizens.
Dialogue#First Citizen=We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
Dialogue#First Citizen=What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
Dialogue#First Citizen=would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
Dialogue#First Citizen=wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
Dialogue#First Citizen=but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
Dialogue#First Citizen=afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
Dialogue#First Citizen=inventory to particularise their abundance; our
Dialogue#First Citizen=sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
Dialogue#First Citizen=our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
Dialogue#First Citizen=speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
Dialogue#Second Citizen=Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
Dialogue#All=Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.
Dialogue#Second Citizen=Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Dialogue#First Citizen=Very well; and could be content to give him good
Dialogue#First Citizen=report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Dialogue#Second Citizen=Nay, but speak not maliciously.
Dialogue#First Citizen=I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
Dialogue#First Citizen=it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
Dialogue#First Citizen=content to say it was for his country he did it to
Dialogue#First Citizen=please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
Dialogue#First Citizen=is, even till the altitude of his virtue.
Dialogue#Second Citizen=What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
Dialogue#Second Citizen=vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
Dialogue#First Citizen=If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
Dialogue#First Citizen=he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
Notice#Shouts within
Dialogue#First Citizen=What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
Dialogue#First Citizen=is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!
Dialogue#All=Come, come.
Dialogue#First Citizen=Soft! who comes here?
Notice#Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA
Dialogue#Second Citizen=Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
Dialogue#Second Citizen=the people.
Dialogue#First Citizen=He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
Dialogue#MENENIUS=What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
Dialogue#MENENIUS=With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.
Dialogue#First Citizen=Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
Dialogue#First Citizen=had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
Dialogue#First Citizen=which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
Dialogue#First Citizen=suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
Dialogue#First Citizen=have strong arms too.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Will you undo yourselves?
Dialogue#First Citizen=We cannot, sir, we are undone already.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I tell you, friends, most charitable care
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Against the Roman state, whose course will on
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=You are transported by calamity
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Thither where more attends you, and you slander
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=When you curse them as enemies.
Dialogue#First Citizen=Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
Dialogue#First Citizen=yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
Dialogue#First Citizen=crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
Dialogue#First Citizen=support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
Dialogue#First Citizen=established against the rich, and provide more
Dialogue#First Citizen=piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
Dialogue#First Citizen=the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
Dialogue#First Citizen=there's all the love they bear us.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Either you must
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
Dialogue#MENENIUS=A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
Dialogue#MENENIUS=To stale 't a little more.
Dialogue#First Citizen=Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
Dialogue#First Citizen=fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
Dialogue#First Citizen=you, deliver.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=There was a time when all the body's members
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=That only like a gulf it did remain
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And, mutually participate, did minister
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Unto the appetite and affection common
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--
Dialogue#First Citizen=Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
Dialogue#MENENIUS=For, look you, I may make the belly smile
Dialogue#MENENIUS=As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
Dialogue#MENENIUS=To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
Dialogue#MENENIUS=That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
Dialogue#MENENIUS=As you malign our senators for that
Dialogue#MENENIUS=They are not such as you.
Dialogue#First Citizen=Your belly's answer? What!
Dialogue#First Citizen=The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
Dialogue#First Citizen=The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
Dialogue#First Citizen=Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.
Dialogue#First Citizen=With other muniments and petty helps
Dialogue#First Citizen=In this our fabric, if that they--
Dialogue#MENENIUS=What then?
Dialogue#MENENIUS='Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?
Dialogue#First Citizen=Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
Dialogue#First Citizen=Who is the sink o' the body,--
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Well, what then?
Dialogue#First Citizen=The former agents, if they did complain,
Dialogue#First Citizen=What could the belly answer?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I will tell you
Dialogue#MENENIUS=If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.
Dialogue#First Citizen=Ye're long about it.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Note me this, good friend;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Your most grave belly was deliberate,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
Dialogue#MENENIUS='True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
Dialogue#MENENIUS='That I receive the general food at first,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Because I am the store-house and the shop
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I send it through the rivers of your blood,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And, through the cranks and offices of man,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
Dialogue#MENENIUS=From me receive that natural competency
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--
Dialogue#First Citizen=Ay, sir; well, well.
Dialogue#MENENIUS='Though all at once cannot
Dialogue#MENENIUS=See what I do deliver out to each,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Yet I can make my audit up, that all
Dialogue#MENENIUS=From me do back receive the flour of all,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?
Dialogue#First Citizen=It was an answer: how apply you this?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The senators of Rome are this good belly,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And you the mutinous members; for examine
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
Dialogue#MENENIUS=No public benefit which you receive
Dialogue#MENENIUS=But it proceeds or comes from them to you
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=You, the great toe of this assembly?
Dialogue#First Citizen=I the great toe! why the great toe?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Lead'st first to win some vantage.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The one side must have bale.
Notice#Enter CAIUS MARCIUS
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Hail, noble Marcius!
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Make yourselves scabs?
Dialogue#First Citizen=We have ever your good word.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=He that will give good words to thee will flatter
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
Dialogue#MARCIUS=To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And curse that justice did it.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Who deserves greatness
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Deserves your hate; and your affections are
Dialogue#MARCIUS=A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Which would increase his evil. He that depends
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
Dialogue#MARCIUS=With every minute you do change a mind,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And call him noble that was now your hate,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=That in these several places of the city
Dialogue#MARCIUS=You cry against the noble senate, who,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The city is well stored.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Hang 'em! They say!
Dialogue#MARCIUS=They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
Dialogue#MARCIUS=What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Who thrives and who declines; side factions
Dialogue#MARCIUS=and give out
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And feebling such as stand not in their liking
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
Dialogue#MARCIUS=grain enough!
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
Dialogue#MARCIUS=With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
Dialogue#MARCIUS=As I could pick my lance.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=For though abundantly they lack discretion,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=What says the other troop?
Dialogue#MARCIUS=They are dissolved: hang 'em!
Dialogue#MARCIUS=They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
Dialogue#MARCIUS=They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And a petition granted them, a strange one--
Dialogue#MARCIUS=To break the heart of generosity,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
Dialogue#MARCIUS=As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Shouting their emulation.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=What is granted them?
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
Dialogue#MARCIUS=The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
Dialogue#MARCIUS=For insurrection's arguing.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=This is strange.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Go, get you home, you fragments!
Notice#Enter a Messenger, hastily
Dialogue#Messenger=Where's Caius Marcius?
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Here: what's the matter?
Dialogue#Messenger=The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
Notice#Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators; JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS
Dialogue#First Senator=Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
Dialogue#First Senator=The Volsces are in arms.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=They have a leader,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=I sin in envying his nobility,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And were I any thing but what I am,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=I would wish me only he.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=You have fought together.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Only my wars with him: he is a lion
Dialogue#MARCIUS=That I am proud to hunt.
Dialogue#First Senator=Then, worthy Marcius,
Dialogue#First Senator=Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=It is your former promise.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Sir, it is;
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?
Dialogue#TITUS=No, Caius Marcius;
Dialogue#TITUS=I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
Dialogue#TITUS=Ere stay behind this business.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=O, true-bred!
Dialogue#First Senator=Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
Dialogue#First Senator=Our greatest friends attend us.
Dialogue#TITUS=[To COMINIUS]                Lead you on.
Notice#To MARCIUS
Dialogue#TITUS=Right worthy you priority.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Noble Marcius!
Dialogue#First Senator=[To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes; be gone!
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Nay, let them follow:
Dialogue#MARCIUS=The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
Dialogue#MARCIUS=To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.
Notice#Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
Dialogue#BRUTUS=He has no equal.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Nay. but his taunts.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Be-mock the modest moon.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=The present wars devour him: he is grown
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Too proud to be so valiant.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Such a nature,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
Dialogue#SICINIUS=His insolence can brook to be commanded
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Under Cominius.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Fame, at the which he aims,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=In whom already he's well graced, can not
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Better be held nor more attain'd than by
Dialogue#BRUTUS=A place below the first: for what miscarries
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
Dialogue#BRUTUS=To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Had borne the business!'
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Besides, if things go well,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Of his demerits rob Cominius.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Come:
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults
Dialogue#BRUTUS=To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
Dialogue#BRUTUS=In aught he merit not.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Let's hence, and hear
Dialogue#SICINIUS=How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=More than his singularity, he goes
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Upon this present action.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Lets along.
Notice#Exeunt

Notice#Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS and certain Senators
Dialogue#First Senator=So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
Dialogue#First Senator=That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
Dialogue#First Senator=And know how we proceed.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Is it not yours?
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=What ever have been thought on in this state,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
Notice#Reads
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS='They have press'd a power, but it is not known
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=These three lead on this preparation
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Consider of it.'
Dialogue#First Senator=                  Our army's in the field
Dialogue#First Senator=We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
Dialogue#First Senator=To answer us.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=                  Nor did you think it folly
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=They needs must show themselves; which
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=in the hatching,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=To take in many towns ere almost Rome
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Should know we were afoot.
Dialogue#Second Senator=Noble Aufidius,
Dialogue#Second Senator=Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
Dialogue#Second Senator=Let us alone to guard Corioli:
Dialogue#Second Senator=If they set down before 's, for the remove
Dialogue#Second Senator=Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find
Dialogue#Second Senator=They've not prepared for us.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=O, doubt not that;
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Some parcels of their power are forth already,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS='Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Till one can do no more.
Dialogue#All=The gods assist you!

Banner#SCENE III. Rome. A room in Marcius' house.
Notice#Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA	they set them down on two low stools, and sew
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=he would show most love. When yet he was but
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=how honour would become such a person. that it was
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=man.
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=But had he died in the business, madam; how then?
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Then his good report should have been my son; I
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=alike and none less dear than thine and my good
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Notice#Enter a Gentlewoman
Dialogue#Gentlewoman=Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Indeed, you shall not.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA='Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Or all or lose his hire.
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=We are fit to bid her welcome.
Notice#Exit Gentlewoman
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

Notice#Enter VALERIA, with an Usher and Gentlewoman
Dialogue#VALERIA=My ladies both, good day to you.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Sweet madam.
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=I am glad to see your ladyship.
Dialogue#VALERIA=How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
Dialogue#VALERIA=What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
Dialogue#VALERIA=faith. How does your little son?
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=look upon his school-master.
Dialogue#VALERIA=O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
Dialogue#VALERIA=very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
Dialogue#VALERIA=Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
Dialogue#VALERIA=confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
Dialogue#VALERIA=butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
Dialogue#VALERIA=again; and after it again; and over and over he
Dialogue#VALERIA=comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his
Dialogue#VALERIA=fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his
Dialogue#VALERIA=teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
Dialogue#VALERIA=it!
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=One on 's father's moods.
Dialogue#VALERIA=Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=A crack, madam.
Dialogue#VALERIA=Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play
Dialogue#VALERIA=the idle husewife with me this afternoon.
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
Dialogue#VALERIA=Not out of doors!
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=She shall, she shall.
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=threshold till my lord return from the wars.
Dialogue#VALERIA=Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,
Dialogue#VALERIA=you must go visit the good lady that lies in.
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=my prayers; but I cannot go thither.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Why, I pray you?
Dialogue#VIRGILIA='Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
Dialogue#VALERIA=You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
Dialogue#VALERIA=the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
Dialogue#VALERIA=Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric
Dialogue#VALERIA=were sensible as your finger, that you might leave
Dialogue#VALERIA=pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.
Dialogue#VALERIA=In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you
Dialogue#VALERIA=excellent news of your husband.
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=O, good madam, there can be none yet.
Dialogue#VALERIA=Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from
Dialogue#VALERIA=him last night.
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=Indeed, madam?
Dialogue#VALERIA=In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.
Dialogue#VALERIA=Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
Dialogue#VALERIA=whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
Dialogue#VALERIA=our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set
Dialogue#VALERIA=down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
Dialogue#VALERIA=prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
Dialogue#VALERIA=on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=thing hereafter.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but

Dialogue#LARTIUS=Agreed.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Say, has our general met the enemy?
Dialogue#Messenger=They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.
Dialogue#LARTIUS=So, the good horse is mine.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=I'll buy him of you.
Dialogue#LARTIUS=No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
Dialogue#LARTIUS=For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=How far off lie these armies?
Dialogue#Messenger=Within this mile and half.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
Notice#They sound a parley. Enter two Senators with others on the walls
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
Dialogue#First Senator=No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
Dialogue#First Senator=That's lesser than a little.
Notice#Drums afar off
Dialogue#First Senator=Hark! our drums
Dialogue#First Senator=Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,

Dialogue#MARCIUS=With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=brave Titus:
Dialogue#MARCIUS=They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
Dialogue#MARCIUS=He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And he shall feel mine edge.
Notice#Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches. Re-enter MARCIUS cursing

Dialogue#MARCIUS=Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Further than seen and one infect another
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,

Dialogue#MARCIUS=From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
Dialogue#MARCIUS=All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
Dialogue#MARCIUS=With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
Dialogue#MARCIUS=If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,

Dialogue#First Soldier=To answer all the city.
Dialogue#LARTIUS=O noble fellow!
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
Dialogue#LARTIUS=And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:
Dialogue#LARTIUS=A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
Dialogue#LARTIUS=The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Were feverous and did tremble.
Notice#Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy

Dialogue#MARCIUS=Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
Dialogue#MARCIUS=There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Convenient numbers to make good the city;
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
Dialogue#MARCIUS=To help Cominius.
Dialogue#LARTIUS=                  Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Thy exercise hath been too violent for
Dialogue#LARTIUS=A second course of fight.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Sir, praise me not;
Dialogue#MARCIUS=My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
Dialogue#MARCIUS=The blood I drop is rather physical
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
Dialogue#MARCIUS=I will appear, and fight.
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,

Dialogue#COMINIUS=We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
Dialogue#COMINIUS=The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!

Dialogue#COMINIUS=May give you thankful sacrifice.
Notice#Enter a Messenger
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Thy news?
Dialogue#Messenger=The citizens of Corioli have issued,
Dialogue#Messenger=And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
Dialogue#Messenger=I saw our party to their trenches driven,
Dialogue#Messenger=And then I came away.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Though thou speak'st truth,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Methinks thou speak'st not well.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=How long is't since?
Dialogue#Messenger=Above an hour, my lord.
Dialogue#COMINIUS='Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
Dialogue#COMINIUS=How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And bring thy news so late?
Dialogue#Messenger=Spies of the Volsces
Dialogue#Messenger=Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
Dialogue#Messenger=Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
Dialogue#Messenger=Half an hour since brought my report.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Who's yonder,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
Dialogue#COMINIUS=He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Before-time seen him thus.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=[Within]                 Come I too late?
Dialogue#COMINIUS=The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
Dialogue#COMINIUS=More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
Dialogue#COMINIUS=From every meaner man.

Dialogue#MARCIUS=In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
Dialogue#MARCIUS=As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And tapers burn'd to bedward!
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Flower of warriors,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=How is it with Titus Lartius?
Dialogue#MARCIUS=As with a man busied about decrees:
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=To let him slip at will.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Where is that slave
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Where is he? call him hither.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Let him alone;
Dialogue#MARCIUS=He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--
Dialogue#MARCIUS=The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
Dialogue#MARCIUS=From rascals worse than they.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=But how prevail'd you?
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
Dialogue#MARCIUS=If not, why cease you till you are so?
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Marcius,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=We have at disadvantage fought and did
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Retire to win our purpose.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=How lies their battle? know you on which side
Dialogue#MARCIUS=They have placed their men of trust?
Dialogue#COMINIUS=As I guess, Marcius,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Their very heart of hope.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=I do beseech you,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=By all the battles wherein we have fought,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
Dialogue#MARCIUS=We have made to endure friends, that you directly
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And that you not delay the present, but,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=We prove this very hour.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Though I could wish
Dialogue#COMINIUS=You were conducted to a gentle bath
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Deny your asking: take your choice of those
Dialogue#COMINIUS=That best can aid your action.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Those are they
Dialogue#MARCIUS=That most are willing. If any such be here--
Dialogue#MARCIUS=As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Lesser his person than an ill report;
Dialogue#MARCIUS=If any think brave death outweighs bad life
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And that his country's dearer than himself;
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Let him alone, or so many so minded,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Wave thus, to express his disposition,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And follow Marcius.
Notice#They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps
Dialogue#MARCIUS=O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
Dialogue#MARCIUS=If these shows be not outward, which of you
Dialogue#MARCIUS=But is four Volsces? none of you but is
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Able to bear against the great Aufidius
Dialogue#MARCIUS=A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Though thanks to all, must I select
Dialogue#MARCIUS=from all: the rest
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Shall bear the business in some other fight,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And four shall quickly draw out my command,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Which men are best inclined.

Dialogue#MARCIUS=I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee

Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=We hate alike:
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Let the first budger die the other's slave,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And the gods doom him after!
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=If I fly, Marcius,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Holloa me like a hare.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Within these three hours, Tullus,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Wrench up thy power to the highest.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Wert thou the Hector

Dialogue#COMINIUS=Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the

Dialogue#COMINIUS=Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Our Rome hath such a soldier.'

Notice#Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuit
Dialogue#LARTIUS=O general,
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Here is the steed, we the caparison:
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Hadst thou beheld--
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Pray now, no more: my mother,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Who has a charter to extol her blood,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
Dialogue#MARCIUS=As you have done; that's what I can; induced
Dialogue#MARCIUS=As you have been; that's for my country:
Dialogue#MARCIUS=He that has but effected his good will
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Hath overta'en mine act.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=You shall not be
Dialogue#COMINIUS=The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
Dialogue#COMINIUS=The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=To hide your doings; and to silence that,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
Dialogue#COMINIUS=In sign of what you are, not to reward
Dialogue#COMINIUS=What you have done--before our army hear me.
Dialogue#MARCIUS=I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
Dialogue#MARCIUS=To hear themselves remember'd.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Should they not,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
Dialogue#COMINIUS=The treasure in this field achieved and city,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Before the common distribution, at

Dialogue#MARCIUS=When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
Dialogue#MARCIUS=No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd
Dialogue#MARCIUS=My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
Dialogue#MARCIUS=Which, without note, here's many else have done,--
Dialogue#MARCIUS=You shout me forth
Dialogue#MARCIUS=In acclamations hyperbolical;
Dialogue#MARCIUS=As if I loved my little should be dieted
Dialogue#MARCIUS=In praises sauced with lies.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Too modest are you;
Dialogue#COMINIUS=More cruel to your good report than grateful
Dialogue#COMINIUS=To us that give you truly: by your patience,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,

Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=To undercrest your good addition
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=To the fairness of my power.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=So, to our tent;

Dialogue#COMINIUS=The best, with whom we may articulate,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=For their own good and ours.
Dialogue#LARTIUS=I shall, my lord.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Of my lord general.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=I sometime lay here in Corioli
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=But then Aufidius was with in my view,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=To give my poor host freedom.

Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=As often as we eat. By the elements,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=I thought to crush him in an equal force,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Or wrath or craft may get him.
Dialogue#First Soldier=He's the devil.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd

Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Against the hospitable canon, would I

Dialogue#MENENIUS=The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Good or bad?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
Dialogue#MENENIUS=love not Marcius.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Pray you, who does the wolf love?
Dialogue#SICINIUS=The lamb.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the
Dialogue#MENENIUS=noble Marcius.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two
Dialogue#MENENIUS=are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
Dialogue#Both=Well, sir.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two
Dialogue#MENENIUS=have not in abundance?
Dialogue#BRUTUS=He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Especially in pride.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=And topping all others in boasting.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=This is strange now: do you two know how you are
Dialogue#MENENIUS=censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the
Dialogue#MENENIUS=right-hand file? do you?
Dialogue#Both=Why, how are we censured?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?
Dialogue#Both=Well, well, sir, well.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
Dialogue#MENENIUS=occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at
Dialogue#MENENIUS=your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a
Dialogue#MENENIUS=pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
Dialogue#MENENIUS=being proud?
Dialogue#BRUTUS=We do it not alone, sir.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
Dialogue#MENENIUS=are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
Dialogue#MENENIUS=single: your abilities are too infant-like for
Dialogue#MENENIUS=doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
Dialogue#MENENIUS=could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
Dialogue#MENENIUS=O that you could!
Dialogue#BRUTUS=What then, sir?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as
Dialogue#MENENIUS=any in Rome.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Menenius, you are known well enough too.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
Dialogue#MENENIUS=loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
Dialogue#MENENIUS=favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
Dialogue#MENENIUS=upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
Dialogue#MENENIUS=with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
Dialogue#MENENIUS=of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my
Dialogue#MENENIUS=malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
Dialogue#MENENIUS=you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
Dialogue#MENENIUS=you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a
Dialogue#MENENIUS=crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have
Dialogue#MENENIUS=delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in
Dialogue#MENENIUS=compound with the major part of your syllables: and
Dialogue#MENENIUS=though I must be content to bear with those that say
Dialogue#MENENIUS=you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that
Dialogue#MENENIUS=tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
Dialogue#MENENIUS=the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
Dialogue#MENENIUS=well enough too? what barm can your bisson
Dialogue#MENENIUS=conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be
Dialogue#MENENIUS=known well enough too?
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
Dialogue#MENENIUS=are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
Dialogue#MENENIUS=wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
Dialogue#MENENIUS=cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
Dialogue#MENENIUS=second day of audience. When you are hearing a
Dialogue#MENENIUS=matter between party and party, if you chance to be
Dialogue#MENENIUS=pinched with the colic, you make faces like
Dialogue#MENENIUS=mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
Dialogue#MENENIUS=patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
Dialogue#MENENIUS=by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
Dialogue#MENENIUS=cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are
Dialogue#MENENIUS=a pair of strange ones.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Come, come, you are well understood to be a
Dialogue#BRUTUS=perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
Dialogue#BRUTUS=bencher in the Capitol.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
Dialogue#MENENIUS=encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
Dialogue#MENENIUS=you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
Dialogue#MENENIUS=wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
Dialogue#MENENIUS=so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
Dialogue#MENENIUS=cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
Dialogue#MENENIUS=saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
Dialogue#MENENIUS=since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
Dialogue#MENENIUS=best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
Dialogue#MENENIUS=your worships: more of your conversation would
Dialogue#MENENIUS=infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
Dialogue#MENENIUS=plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.
Notice#BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside
Notice#Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA
Dialogue#MENENIUS=How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
Dialogue#MENENIUS=your eyes so fast?
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=the love of Juno, let's go.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Ha! Marcius coming home!
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=approbation.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Marcius coming home!
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=Nay,'tis true.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=at home for you.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
Dialogue#MENENIUS=me!
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
Dialogue#MENENIUS=years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
Dialogue#MENENIUS=the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
Dialogue#MENENIUS=not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=O, no, no, no.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
Dialogue#MENENIUS=victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=with the oaken garland.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Aufidius got off.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so
Dialogue#MENENIUS=fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold
Dialogue#MENENIUS=that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=has letters from the general, wherein he gives my
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=action outdone his former deeds doubly
Dialogue#VALERIA=In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
Dialogue#MENENIUS=true purchasing.
Dialogue#VIRGILIA=The gods grant them true!
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=True! pow, wow.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=True! I'll be sworn they are true.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Where is he wounded?
Notice#To the Tribunes
Dialogue#MENENIUS=God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
Dialogue#MENENIUS=home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
Dialogue#MENENIUS=nine that I know.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=wounds upon him.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
Notice#A shout and flourish
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Hark! the trumpets.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
Notice#A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the  general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them, CORIOLANUS,  crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and Soldiers, and a Herald

Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=But O, thy wife!
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=                  My gracious silence, hail!
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=And mothers that lack sons.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Now, the gods crown thee!
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=And live you yet?
Notice#To VALERIA
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=O my sweet lady, pardon.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=A curse begin at very root on's heart,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=That is not glad to see thee! You are three
Dialogue#MENENIUS=That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=We have some old crab-trees here
Dialogue#MENENIUS=at home that will not
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=We call a nettle but a nettle and
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The faults of fools but folly.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Ever right.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Menenius ever, ever.
Dialogue#Herald=Give way there, and go on!
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=[To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA]  Your hand, and yours:
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=The good patricians must be visited;
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=From whom I have received not only greetings,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=But with them change of honours.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=I have lived
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=To see inherited my very wishes
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=And the buildings of my fancy: only
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Our Rome will cast upon thee.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Know, good mother,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=I had rather be their servant in my way,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Than sway with them in theirs.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=On, to the Capitol!
Notice#Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before. BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward
Dialogue#BRUTUS=All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Into a rapture lets her baby cry
Dialogue#BRUTUS=While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
Dialogue#BRUTUS=With variable complexions, all agreeing
Dialogue#BRUTUS=In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Do press among the popular throngs and puff
Dialogue#BRUTUS=To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Commit the war of white and damask in
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
Dialogue#BRUTUS=As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Were slily crept into his human powers
Dialogue#BRUTUS=And gave him graceful posture.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=On the sudden,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=I warrant him consul.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Then our office may,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=During his power, go sleep.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=He cannot temperately transport his honours
Dialogue#SICINIUS=From where he should begin and end, but will
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Lose those he hath won.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=In that there's comfort.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Doubt not
Dialogue#SICINIUS=The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Upon their ancient malice will forget
Dialogue#SICINIUS=With the least cause these his new honours, which
Dialogue#SICINIUS=That he will give them make I as little question
Dialogue#SICINIUS=As he is proud to do't.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=I heard him swear,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Were he to stand for consul, never would he
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
Dialogue#BRUTUS=The napless vesture of humility;
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
Dialogue#BRUTUS=To the people, beg their stinking breaths.
Dialogue#SICINIUS='Tis right.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=And the desire of the nobles.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=I wish no better
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
Dialogue#SICINIUS=In execution.
Dialogue#BRUTUS='Tis most like he will.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=It shall be to him then as our good wills,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=A sure destruction.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=So it must fall out
Dialogue#BRUTUS=To him or our authorities. For an end,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=We must suggest the people in what hatred
Dialogue#BRUTUS=He still hath held them; that to's power he would
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=In human action and capacity,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Than camels in the war, who have their provand
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
Dialogue#BRUTUS=For sinking under them.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=This, as you say, suggested
Dialogue#SICINIUS=At some time when his soaring insolence
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
Dialogue#SICINIUS=As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
Dialogue#SICINIUS=To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Shall darken him for ever.
Notice#Enter a Messenger
Dialogue#BRUTUS=What's the matter?
Dialogue#Messenger=You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
Dialogue#Messenger=That Marcius shall be consul:
Dialogue#Messenger=I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
Dialogue#Messenger=The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
Dialogue#Messenger=Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
Dialogue#Messenger=Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
Dialogue#Messenger=As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
Dialogue#Messenger=A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
Dialogue#Messenger=I never saw the like.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Let's to the Capitol;
Dialogue#BRUTUS=And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=But hearts for the event.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Have with you.
Notice#Exeunt
Banner#SCENE II. The same. The Capitol.
Notice#Enter two Officers, to lay cushions
Dialogue#First Officer=Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand
Dialogue#First Officer=for consulships?
Dialogue#Second Officer=Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
Dialogue#Second Officer=Coriolanus will carry it.
Dialogue#First Officer=That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and
Dialogue#First Officer=loves not the common people.
Dialogue#Second Officer=Faith, there had been many great men that have
Dialogue#Second Officer=flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there
Dialogue#Second Officer=be many that they have loved, they know not
Dialogue#Second Officer=wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,
Dialogue#Second Officer=they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
Dialogue#Second Officer=Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
Dialogue#Second Officer=him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
Dialogue#Second Officer=disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
Dialogue#Second Officer=them plainly see't.
Dialogue#First Officer=If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
Dialogue#First Officer=he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
Dialogue#First Officer=good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
Dialogue#First Officer=devotion than can render it him; and leaves
Dialogue#First Officer=nothing undone that may fully discover him their
Dialogue#First Officer=opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
Dialogue#First Officer=displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
Dialogue#First Officer=dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Dialogue#Second Officer=He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
Dialogue#Second Officer=ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
Dialogue#Second Officer=having been supple and courteous to the people,
Dialogue#Second Officer=bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
Dialogue#Second Officer=an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
Dialogue#Second Officer=planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
Dialogue#Second Officer=in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
Dialogue#Second Officer=silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
Dialogue#Second Officer=ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
Dialogue#Second Officer=malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck
Dialogue#Second Officer=reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.
Dialogue#First Officer=No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
Dialogue#First Officer=are coming.
Notice#A sennet. Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS  the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators,  SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their  places; the Tribunes take their Places by themselves. CORIOLANUS stands
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Having determined of the Volsces and
Dialogue#MENENIUS=To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=As the main point of this our after-meeting,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=To gratify his noble service that
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=please you,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The present consul, and last general
Dialogue#MENENIUS=In our well-found successes, to report
Dialogue#MENENIUS=A little of that worthy work perform'd
Dialogue#MENENIUS=By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom
Dialogue#MENENIUS=We met here both to thank and to remember
Dialogue#MENENIUS=With honours like himself.
Dialogue#First Senator=Speak, good Cominius:
Dialogue#First Senator=Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
Dialogue#First Senator=Rather our state's defective for requital
Dialogue#First Senator=Than we to stretch it out.
Notice#To the Tribunes
Dialogue#First Senator=Masters o' the people,
Dialogue#First Senator=We do request your kindest ears, and after,
Dialogue#First Senator=Your loving motion toward the common body,
Dialogue#First Senator=To yield what passes here.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=We are convented
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Inclinable to honour and advance
Dialogue#SICINIUS=The theme of our assembly.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Which the rather
Dialogue#BRUTUS=We shall be blest to do, if he remember
Dialogue#BRUTUS=A kinder value of the people than
Dialogue#BRUTUS=He hath hereto prized them at.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=That's off, that's off;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I would you rather had been silent. Please you
Dialogue#MENENIUS=To hear Cominius speak?
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Most willingly;
Dialogue#BRUTUS=But yet my caution was more pertinent
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Than the rebuke you give it.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=He loves your people
Dialogue#MENENIUS=But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Worthy Cominius, speak.
Notice#CORIOLANUS offers to go away
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Nay, keep your place.
Dialogue#First Senator=Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
Dialogue#First Senator=What you have nobly done.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Your horror's pardon:
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Than hear say how I got them.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Sir, I hope
Dialogue#BRUTUS=My words disbench'd you not.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=No, sir: yet oft,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=your people,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=I love them as they weigh.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Pray now, sit down.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=When the alarum were struck than idly sit
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=To hear my nothings monster'd.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Masters of the people,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
Dialogue#MENENIUS=That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
Dialogue#MENENIUS=He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
Dialogue#COMINIUS=That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=The man I speak of cannot in the world
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=When with his Amazonian chin he drove
Dialogue#COMINIUS=The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
Dialogue#COMINIUS=An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=When he might act the woman in the scene,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
Dialogue#COMINIUS=He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Before and in Corioli, let me say,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And by his rare example made the coward
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
Dialogue#COMINIUS=A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
Dialogue#COMINIUS=He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
Dialogue#COMINIUS=The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
Dialogue#COMINIUS=With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And with a sudden reinforcement struck
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
Dialogue#COMINIUS=When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
Dialogue#COMINIUS=His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And to the battle came he; where he did
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
Dialogue#COMINIUS='Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Both field and city ours, he never stood
Dialogue#COMINIUS=To ease his breast with panting.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Worthy man!
Dialogue#First Senator=He cannot but with measure fit the honours
Dialogue#First Senator=Which we devise him.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Our spoils he kick'd at,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And look'd upon things precious as they were
Dialogue#COMINIUS=The common muck of the world: he covets less
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Than misery itself would give; rewards
Dialogue#COMINIUS=His deeds with doing them, and is content
Dialogue#COMINIUS=To spend the time to end it.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=He's right noble:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Let him be call'd for.
Dialogue#First Senator=Call Coriolanus.
Dialogue#Officer=He doth appear.
Notice#Re-enter CORIOLANUS
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
Dialogue#MENENIUS=To make thee consul.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=I do owe them still
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=My life and services.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=It then remains
Dialogue#MENENIUS=That you do speak to the people.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=I do beseech you,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=That I may pass this doing.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Sir, the people
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Must have their voices; neither will they bate
Dialogue#SICINIUS=One jot of ceremony.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Put them not to't:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Take to you, as your predecessors have,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Your honour with your form.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=It is apart
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=That I shall blush in acting, and might well
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Be taken from the people.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Mark you that?
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=As if I had received them for the hire
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Of their breath only!
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Do not stand upon't.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Wish we all joy and honour.
Dialogue#Senators=To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
Notice#Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
Dialogue#BRUTUS=You see how he intends to use the people.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=May they perceive's intent! He will require them,

Dialogue#SICINIUS=Should be in them to give.

Dialogue#Third Citizen=tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if
Dialogue#Third Citizen=he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
Dialogue#Third Citizen=our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
Dialogue#Third Citizen=monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
Dialogue#Third Citizen=were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
Dialogue#Third Citizen=which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
Dialogue#Third Citizen=monstrous members.
Dialogue#First Citizen=And to make us no better thought of, a little help
Dialogue#First Citizen=will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he
Dialogue#First Citizen=himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.
Dialogue#Third Citizen=We have been called so of many; not that our heads
Dialogue#Third Citizen=are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
Dialogue#Third Citizen=but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
Dialogue#Third Citizen=truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
Dialogue#Third Citizen=one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
Dialogue#Third Citizen=and their consent of one direct way should be at
Dialogue#Third Citizen=once to all the points o' the compass.
Dialogue#Second Citizen=Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
Dialogue#Second Citizen=fly?
Dialogue#Third Citizen=Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
Dialogue#Third Citizen=will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
Dialogue#Third Citizen=if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.
Dialogue#Second Citizen=Why that way?
Dialogue#Third Citizen=To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts
Dialogue#Third Citizen=melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
Dialogue#Third Citizen=for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.
Dialogue#Second Citizen=You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.
Dialogue#Third Citizen=Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
Dialogue#Third Citizen=that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I

Dialogue#Third Citizen=never a worthier man.

Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=From the noise of our own drums.'
Dialogue#MENENIUS=O me, the gods!
Dialogue#MENENIUS=You must not speak of that: you must desire them
Dialogue#MENENIUS=To think upon you.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=                  Think upon me! hang 'em!
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=I would they would forget me, like the virtues
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Which our divines lose by 'em.

Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Mine own desert.
Dialogue#Second Citizen=Your own desert!
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Ay, but not mine own desire.
Dialogue#Third Citizen=How not your own desire?
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=poor with begging.
Dialogue#Third Citizen=You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
Dialogue#Third Citizen=gain by you.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
Dialogue#First Citizen=The price is to ask it kindly.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=good voice, sir; what say you?
Dialogue#Second Citizen=You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices

Dialogue#Fourth Citizen=have not deserved nobly.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Your enigma?
Dialogue#Fourth Citizen=You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
Dialogue#Fourth Citizen=been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved
Dialogue#Fourth Citizen=the common people.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=You should account me the more virtuous that I have
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=the insinuating nod and be off to them most
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=bewitchment of some popular man and give it
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=I may be consul.
Dialogue#Fifth Citizen=We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
Dialogue#Fifth Citizen=you our voices heartily.

Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=What custom wills, in all things should we do't,

Dialogue#First Citizen=He has our voices, sir.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
Dialogue#Second Citizen=Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
Dialogue#Second Citizen=He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
Dialogue#Third Citizen=Certainly
Dialogue#Third Citizen=He flouted us downright.
Dialogue#First Citizen=No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.
Dialogue#Second Citizen=Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
Dialogue#Second Citizen=He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
Dialogue#Second Citizen=His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Why, so he did, I am sure.
Dialogue#Citizens=No, no; no man saw 'em.
Dialogue#Third Citizen=He said he had wounds, which he could show
Dialogue#Third Citizen=in private;
Dialogue#Third Citizen=And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
Dialogue#Third Citizen='I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
Dialogue#Third Citizen=But by your voices, will not so permit me;
Dialogue#Third Citizen=Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
Dialogue#Third Citizen=Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
Dialogue#Third Citizen=Your most sweet voices: now you have left
Dialogue#Third Citizen=your voices,
Dialogue#Third Citizen=I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Why either were you ignorant to see't,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
Dialogue#SICINIUS=To yield your voices?
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Could you not have told him
Dialogue#BRUTUS=As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=But was a petty servant to the state,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=He was your enemy, ever spake against
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Your liberties and the charters that you bear
Dialogue#BRUTUS=I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
Dialogue#BRUTUS=A place of potency and sway o' the state,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=If he should still malignantly remain
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
Dialogue#BRUTUS=That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Would think upon you for your voices and
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Translate his malice towards you into love,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Standing your friendly lord.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Thus to have said,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
Dialogue#SICINIUS=And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Either his gracious promise, which you might,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Which easily endures not article
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
Dialogue#SICINIUS=And pass'd him unelected.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Did you perceive
Dialogue#BRUTUS=He did solicit you in free contempt
Dialogue#BRUTUS=When he did need your loves, and do you think
Dialogue#BRUTUS=That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
Dialogue#BRUTUS=No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Against the rectorship of judgment?
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Have you
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Ere now denied the asker? and now again
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Your sued-for tongues?
Dialogue#Third Citizen=He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
Dialogue#Second Citizen=And will deny him:
Dialogue#Second Citizen=I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
Dialogue#First Citizen=I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=They have chose a consul that will from them take
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Their liberties; make them of no more voice
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
Dialogue#BRUTUS=As therefore kept to do so.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Let them assemble,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=And on a safer judgment all revoke
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
Dialogue#SICINIUS=With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Thinking upon his services, took from you
Dialogue#SICINIUS=The apprehension of his present portance,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
Dialogue#SICINIUS=After the inveterate hate he bears you.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Lay
Dialogue#BRUTUS=A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=No impediment between, but that you must
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Cast your election on him.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Say, you chose him
Dialogue#SICINIUS=More after our commandment than as guided
Dialogue#SICINIUS=By your own true affections, and that your minds,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Preoccupied with what you rather must do
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Than what you should, made you against the grain
Dialogue#SICINIUS=To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=How youngly he began to serve his country,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
Dialogue#BRUTUS=That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
Dialogue#BRUTUS=And  [Censorinus,]  nobly named so,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Twice being  [by the people chosen]  censor,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Was his great ancestor.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=One thus descended,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=That hath beside well in his person wrought
Dialogue#SICINIUS=To be set high in place, we did commend
Dialogue#SICINIUS=To your remembrances: but you have found,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Scaling his present bearing with his past,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Your sudden approbation.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Say, you ne'er had done't--
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
Dialogue#BRUTUS=And presently, when you have drawn your number,

Dialogue#All=We will so: almost all
Dialogue#All=Repent in their election.
Notice#Exeunt Citizens

Dialogue#BRUTUS=The vantage of his anger.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=To the Capitol, come:

Dialogue#LARTIUS=On safe-guard he  came to me; and did curse
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Spoke he of me?
Dialogue#LARTIUS=                  He did, my lord.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=How? what?
Dialogue#LARTIUS=How often he had met you, sword to sword;
Dialogue#LARTIUS=That of all things upon the earth he hated
Dialogue#LARTIUS=Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
Dialogue#LARTIUS=To hopeless restitution, so he might

Dialogue#First Senator=Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=The people are incensed against him.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Stop,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Or all will fall in broil.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Are these your herd?
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Must these have voices, that can yield them now
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=your offices?
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Have you not set them on?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Be calm, be calm.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=To curb the will of the nobility:
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Nor ever will be ruled.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Call't not a plot:
Dialogue#BRUTUS=The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Why, this was known before.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Not to them all.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Have you inform'd them sithence?
Dialogue#BRUTUS=How! I inform them!
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=You are like to do such business.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Not unlike,

Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Your fellow tribune.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=You show too much of that
Dialogue#SICINIUS=For which the people stir: if you will pass
Dialogue#SICINIUS=To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Or never be so noble as a consul,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Nor yoke with him for tribune.

Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Regard me as I do not flatter, and
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Therein behold themselves: I say again,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=and scatter'd,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,

Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=As for my country I have shed my blood,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs

Dialogue#COMINIUS='Twas from the canon.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS='Shall'!
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=O good but most unwise patricians! why,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=And make your channel his? If he have power
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Be not as common fools; if you are not,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=If they be senators: and they are no less,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=To know, when two authorities are up,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Neither supreme, how soon confusion
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=The one by the other.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Well, on to the market-place.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Sometime in Greece,--
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Well, well, no more of that.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Though there the people had more absolute power,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=The ruin of the state.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Why, shall the people give
Dialogue#BRUTUS=One that speaks thus their voice?
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=I'll give my reasons,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Was not our recompense, resting well assured
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Which they have often made against the senate,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=All cause unborn, could never be the motive
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=How shall this bisson multitude digest
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=We are the greater poll, and in true fear
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=The nature of our seats and make the rabble
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Call our cares fears; which will in time
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=The crows to peck the eagles.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Come, enough.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Enough, with over-measure.

Dialogue#MENENIUS=What is about to be? I am out of breath;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
Dialogue#MENENIUS=To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Speak, good Sicinius.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Hear me, people; peace!
Dialogue#Citizens=Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=You are at point to lose your liberties:
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,

Dialogue#MENENIUS=Fie, fie, fie!
Dialogue#MENENIUS=This is the way to kindle, not to quench.

Dialogue#BRUTUS=The people's magistrates.
Dialogue#Citizens=You so remain.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And so are like to do.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=That is the way to lay the city flat;
Dialogue#COMINIUS=To bring the roof to the foundation,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=In heaps and piles of ruin.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=This deserves death.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Or let us stand to our authority,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
Dialogue#BRUTUS=We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Of present death.

Dialogue#MENENIUS=Be gone;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=One time will owe another.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=On fair ground
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=I could beat forty of them.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=I could myself
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
Dialogue#COMINIUS=two tribunes:
Dialogue#COMINIUS=But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,

Dialogue#COMINIUS=Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
Dialogue#COMINIUS=What they are used to bear.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Pray you, be gone:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I'll try whether my old wit be in request
Dialogue#MENENIUS=With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
Dialogue#MENENIUS=With cloth of any colour.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Nay, come away.
Notice#Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, and others
Dialogue#A Patrician=This man has marr'd his fortune.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=His nature is too noble for the world:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And, being angry, does forget that ever
Dialogue#MENENIUS=He heard the name of death.
Notice#A noise within
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Here's goodly work!

Notice#Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, with the rabble
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Where is this viper
Dialogue#SICINIUS=That would depopulate the city and
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Be every man himself?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=You worthy tribunes,--
Dialogue#SICINIUS=He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
Dialogue#SICINIUS=With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Than the severity of the public power
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Which he so sets at nought.
Dialogue#First Citizen=He shall well know
Dialogue#First Citizen=The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
Dialogue#First Citizen=And we their hands.
Dialogue#Citizens=He shall, sure on't.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Sir, sir,--
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Peace!
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
Dialogue#MENENIUS=With modest warrant.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Sir, how comes't that you
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Have holp to make this rescue?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Hear me speak:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=As I do know the consul's worthiness,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=So can I name his faults,--
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Consul! what consul?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The consul Coriolanus.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=He consul!
Dialogue#Citizens=No, no, no, no, no.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The which shall turn you to no further harm
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Than so much loss of time.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Speak briefly then;
Dialogue#SICINIUS=For we are peremptory to dispatch
Dialogue#SICINIUS=This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Were but one danger, and to keep him here
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
Dialogue#SICINIUS=He dies to-night.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=                  Now the good gods forbid
Dialogue#MENENIUS=That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
Dialogue#MENENIUS=In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Should now eat up her own!
Dialogue#SICINIUS=He's a disease that must be cut away.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And what is left, to lose it by his country,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=A brand to the end o' the world.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=This is clean kam.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Merely awry: when he did love his country,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=It honour'd him.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=                  The service of the foot
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Being once gangrened, is not then respected
Dialogue#MENENIUS=For what before it was.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=We'll hear no more.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Spread further.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=                  One word more, one word.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And sack great Rome with Romans.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=If it were so,--
Dialogue#SICINIUS=What do ye talk?
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
Dialogue#MENENIUS=In bolted language; meal and bran together
Dialogue#MENENIUS=He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=In peace, to his utmost peril.
Dialogue#First Senator=Noble tribunes,
Dialogue#First Senator=It is the humane way: the other course
Dialogue#First Senator=Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
Dialogue#First Senator=Unknown to the beginning.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Noble Menenius,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Be you then as the people's officer.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Masters, lay down your weapons.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Go not home.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
Dialogue#SICINIUS=In our first way.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=                  I'll bring him to you.

Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=I would have had you put your power well on,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Before you had worn it out.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Let go.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=You might have been enough the man you are,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=With striving less to be so; lesser had been
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=The thwartings of your dispositions, if
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Let them hang.

Notice#Enter MENENIUS and Senators
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Come, come, you have been too rough, something

Dialogue#First Senator=There's no remedy;
Dialogue#First Senator=Unless, by not so doing, our good city
Dialogue#First Senator=Cleave in the midst, and perish.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Pray, be counsell'd:
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=I have a heart as little apt as yours,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=To better vantage.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=                  Well said, noble woman?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
Dialogue#MENENIUS=For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Which I can scarcely bear.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=What must I do?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Return to the tribunes.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Well, what then? what then?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Repent what you have spoke.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=For them! I cannot do it to the gods;

Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=You are too absolute;

Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=That it shall hold companionship in peace
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=With honour, as in war, since that to both
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=It stands in like request?
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Why force you this?
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Because that now it lies you on to speak
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=To the people; not by your own instruction,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=But with such words that are but rooted in
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Now, this no more dishonours you at all
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Than to take in a town with gentle words,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Which else would put you to your fortune and
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=The hazard of much blood.
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=I would dissemble with my nature where
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=My fortunes and my friends at stake required

Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant

Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=But owe thy pride thyself.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Pray, be content:

Dialogue#Volsce=Nicanor? no.
Dialogue#Roman=The same, sir.
Dialogue#Volsce=You had more beard when I last saw you; but your
Dialogue#Volsce=favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the
Dialogue#Volsce=news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,
Dialogue#Volsce=to find you out there: you have well saved me a
Dialogue#Volsce=day's journey.
Dialogue#Roman=There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the

Dialogue#Volsce=so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and
Dialogue#Volsce=hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.
Dialogue#Roman=The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
Dialogue#Roman=would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
Dialogue#Roman=so to heart the banishment of that worthy
Dialogue#Roman=Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
Dialogue#Roman=all power from the people and to pluck from them
Dialogue#Roman=their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can

Dialogue#Roman=The day serves well for them now. I have heard it

Dialogue#Roman=Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
Dialogue#Roman=great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request

Dialogue#Volsce=business, and I will merrily accompany you home.
Dialogue#Roman=I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
Dialogue#Roman=strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
Dialogue#Roman=their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?
Dialogue#Volsce=A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,
Dialogue#Volsce=distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,
Dialogue#Volsce=and to be on foot at an hour's warning.
Dialogue#Roman=I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the
Dialogue#Roman=man, I think, that shall set them in present action.

Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Against my canker'd country with the spleen
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Longer to live most weary, and present
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=It be to do thee service.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=O Marcius, Marcius!
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Mine arms about that body, where against
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=The anvil of my sword, and do contest
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=As hotly and as nobly with thy love
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=As ever in ambitious strength I did
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=I loved the maid I married; never man
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=We have been down together in my sleep,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And take our friendly senators by the hands;
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Who am prepared against your territories,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Though not for Rome itself.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=You bless me, gods!
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=The leading of thine own revenges, take
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=The one half of my commission; and set down--
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Let me commend thee first to those that shall
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!
Notice#Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two Servingmen come forward
Dialogue#First Servingman=Here's a strange alteration!
Dialogue#Second Servingman=By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
Dialogue#Second Servingman=a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
Dialogue#Second Servingman=false report of him.
Dialogue#First Servingman=What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
Dialogue#First Servingman=finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
Dialogue#Second Servingman=Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
Dialogue#Second Servingman=him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I
Dialogue#Second Servingman=cannot tell how to term it.
Dialogue#First Servingman=He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,
Dialogue#First Servingman=but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
Dialogue#Second Servingman=So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
Dialogue#Second Servingman=man i' the world.
Dialogue#First Servingman=I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
Dialogue#Second Servingman=Who, my master?
Dialogue#First Servingman=Nay, it's no matter for that.
Dialogue#Second Servingman=Worth six on him.
Dialogue#First Servingman=Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
Dialogue#First Servingman=greater soldier.
Dialogue#Second Servingman=Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:
Dialogue#Second Servingman=for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.
Dialogue#First Servingman=Ay, and for an assault too.
Notice#Re-enter third Servingman
Dialogue#Third Servingman=O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!
Dialogue#Second Servingman=What, what, what? let's partake.
Dialogue#Third Servingman=I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
Dialogue#Third Servingman=lieve be a condemned man.
Dialogue#Second Servingman=Wherefore? wherefore?
Dialogue#Third Servingman=Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,
Dialogue#Third Servingman=Caius Marcius.
Dialogue#First Servingman=Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
Dialogue#Third Servingman=I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always
Dialogue#Third Servingman=good enough for him.
Dialogue#Second Servingman=Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
Dialogue#Second Servingman=hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.
Dialogue#First Servingman=He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
Dialogue#First Servingman=on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
Dialogue#First Servingman=him like a carbon ado.
Dialogue#Second Servingman=An he had been cannibally given, he might have
Dialogue#Second Servingman=broiled and eaten him too.
Dialogue#First Servingman=But, more of thy news?
Dialogue#Third Servingman=Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
Dialogue#Third Servingman=and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no
Dialogue#Third Servingman=question asked him by any of the senators, but they
Dialogue#Third Servingman=stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
Dialogue#Third Servingman=mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
Dialogue#Third Servingman=turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
Dialogue#Third Servingman=the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
Dialogue#Third Servingman=the middle and but one half of what he was
Dialogue#Third Servingman=yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty
Dialogue#Third Servingman=and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
Dialogue#Third Servingman=and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
Dialogue#Third Servingman=will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.
Dialogue#Second Servingman=And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
Dialogue#Third Servingman=Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as
Dialogue#Third Servingman=many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
Dialogue#Third Servingman=were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
Dialogue#Third Servingman=we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.
Dialogue#First Servingman=Directitude! what's that?
Dialogue#Third Servingman=But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
Dialogue#Third Servingman=and the man in blood, they will out of their
Dialogue#Third Servingman=burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
Dialogue#Third Servingman=him.
Dialogue#First Servingman=But when goes this forward?
Dialogue#Third Servingman=To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
Dialogue#Third Servingman=drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
Dialogue#Third Servingman=parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
Dialogue#Third Servingman=wipe their lips.
Dialogue#Second Servingman=Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
Dialogue#Second Servingman=This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
Dialogue#Second Servingman=tailors, and breed ballad-makers.
Dialogue#First Servingman=Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
Dialogue#First Servingman=day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and
Dialogue#First Servingman=full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
Dialogue#First Servingman=mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
Dialogue#First Servingman=bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.
Dialogue#Second Servingman='Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
Dialogue#Second Servingman=be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
Dialogue#Second Servingman=great maker of cuckolds.
Dialogue#First Servingman=Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
Dialogue#Third Servingman=Reason; because they then less need one another.
Dialogue#Third Servingman=The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
Dialogue#Third Servingman=as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.
Dialogue#All=In, in, in, in!

Dialogue#MENENIUS=        Hail to you both!
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Your Coriolanus
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
Dialogue#SICINIUS=The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Were he more angry at it.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=All's well; and might have been much better, if
Dialogue#MENENIUS=He could have temporized.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Where is he, hear you?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Hear nothing from him.

Dialogue#First Citizen=Are bound to pray for you both.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Live, and thrive!
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus

Dialogue#Both Tribunes=Farewell, farewell.
Notice#Exeunt Citizens
Dialogue#SICINIUS=This is a happier and more comely time
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Crying confusion.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=                  Caius Marcius was
Dialogue#BRUTUS=A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Self-loving,--
Dialogue#SICINIUS=                  And affecting one sole throne,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Without assistance.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I think not so.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=We should by this, to all our lamentation,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=If he had gone forth consul, found it so.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Sits safe and still without him.
Notice#Enter an AEdile
Dialogue#AEdile=Worthy tribunes,
Dialogue#AEdile=There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
Dialogue#AEdile=Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
Dialogue#AEdile=Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
Dialogue#AEdile=And with the deepest malice of the war
Dialogue#AEdile=Destroy what lies before 'em.
Dialogue#MENENIUS='Tis Aufidius,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And durst not once peep out.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Come, what talk you
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Of Marcius?
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
Dialogue#BRUTUS=The Volsces dare break with us.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Cannot be!
Dialogue#MENENIUS=We have record that very well it can,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And three examples of the like have been
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Before you punish him, where he heard this,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Lest you shall chance to whip your information
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And beat the messenger who bids beware
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Of what is to be dreaded.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Tell not me:
Dialogue#SICINIUS=I know this cannot be.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Not possible.
Notice#Enter a Messenger
Dialogue#Messenger=The nobles in great earnestness are going
Dialogue#Messenger=All to the senate-house: some news is come
Dialogue#Messenger=That turns their countenances.
Dialogue#SICINIUS='Tis this slave;--
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Nothing but his report.
Dialogue#Messenger=Yes, worthy sir,
Dialogue#Messenger=The slave's report is seconded; and more,
Dialogue#Messenger=More fearful, is deliver'd.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=What more fearful?
Dialogue#Messenger=It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
Dialogue#Messenger=How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
Dialogue#Messenger=Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
Dialogue#Messenger=And vows revenge as spacious as between
Dialogue#Messenger=The young'st and oldest thing.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=This is most likely!
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Good Marcius home again.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=The very trick on't.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=This is unlikely:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=He and Aufidius can no more atone
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Than violentest contrariety.
Notice#Enter a second Messenger
Dialogue#Second Messenger=You are sent for to the senate:
Dialogue#Second Messenger=A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius

Dialogue#Second Messenger=What lay before them.
Notice#Enter COMINIUS
Dialogue#COMINIUS=O, you have made good work!
Dialogue#MENENIUS=What news? what news?
Dialogue#COMINIUS=You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
Dialogue#COMINIUS=To melt the city leads upon your pates,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--
Dialogue#MENENIUS=What's the news? what's the news?
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Your temples burned in their cement, and
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Into an auger's bore.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Pray now, your news?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
Dialogue#MENENIUS=If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--
Dialogue#COMINIUS=If!
Dialogue#COMINIUS=He is their god: he leads them like a thing
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Made by some other deity than nature,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=That shapes man better; and they follow him,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Against us brats, with no less confidence
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Or butchers killing flies.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=You have made good work,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much
Dialogue#MENENIUS=on the voice of occupation and
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The breath of garlic-eaters!
Dialogue#COMINIUS=He will shake
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Your Rome about your ears.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=As Hercules
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Did shake down mellow fruit.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=You have made fair work!
Dialogue#BRUTUS=But is this true, sir?
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Ay; and you'll look pale
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Before you find it other. All the regions
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Your enemies and his find something in him.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=We are all undone, unless
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The noble man have mercy.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Who shall ask it?
Dialogue#COMINIUS=The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
Dialogue#COMINIUS=As those should do that had deserved his hate,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And therein show'd like enemies.
Dialogue#MENENIUS='Tis true:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=If he were putting to my house the brand
Dialogue#MENENIUS=That should consume it, I have not the face
Dialogue#MENENIUS=To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!
Dialogue#COMINIUS=You have brought
Dialogue#COMINIUS=A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
Dialogue#COMINIUS=So incapable of help.
Dialogue#Both Tribunes=Say not we brought it.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Who did hoot him out o' the city.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=But I fear
Dialogue#COMINIUS=They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=The second name of men, obeys his points
Dialogue#COMINIUS=As if he were his officer: desperation
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Is all the policy, strength and defence,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=That Rome can make against them.
Notice#Enter a troop of Citizens
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Here come the clusters.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And is Aufidius with him? You are they
Dialogue#MENENIUS=That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And not a hair upon a soldier's head
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
Dialogue#MENENIUS=As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=if he could burn us all into one coal,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=We have deserved it.
Dialogue#Citizens=Faith, we hear fearful news.
Dialogue#First Citizen=For mine own part,
Dialogue#First Citizen=When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.
Dialogue#Second Citizen=And so did I.
Dialogue#Third Citizen=And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
Dialogue#Third Citizen=many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and

Dialogue#Third Citizen=it was against our will.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Ye re goodly things, you voices!

Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Do they still fly to the Roman?
Dialogue#Lieutenant=I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
Dialogue#Lieutenant=Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
Dialogue#Lieutenant=Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
Dialogue#Lieutenant=And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
Dialogue#Lieutenant=Even by your own.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=                  I cannot help it now,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Even to my person, than I thought he would
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=What cannot be amended.
Dialogue#Lieutenant=Yet I wish, sir,--
Dialogue#Lieutenant=I mean for your particular,--you had not
Dialogue#Lieutenant=Join'd in commission with him; but either
Dialogue#Lieutenant=Had borne the action of yourself, or else
Dialogue#Lieutenant=To him had left it solely.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=when he shall come to his account, he knows not
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Whene'er we come to our account.
Dialogue#Lieutenant=Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=All places yield to him ere he sits down;
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And the nobility of Rome are his:
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=The senators and patricians love him too:
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=By sovereignty of nature. First he was
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=A noble servant to them; but he could not
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Which out of daily fortune ever taints
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=To fail in the disposing of those chances
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Not to be other than one thing, not moving
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Even with the same austerity and garb
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=As he hath spices of them all, not all,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Lie in the interpretation of the time:
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And power, unto itself most commendable,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=To extol what it hath done.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.

Dialogue#COMINIUS=He would not seem to know me.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Do you hear?
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Yet one time he did call me by my name:
Dialogue#COMINIUS=I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
Dialogue#COMINIUS=That we have bled together. Coriolanus
Dialogue#COMINIUS=He would not answer to: forbad all names;
Dialogue#COMINIUS=He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Of burning Rome.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Why, so: you have made good work!
Dialogue#MENENIUS=A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!
Dialogue#COMINIUS=I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
Dialogue#COMINIUS=When it was less expected: he replied,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=It was a bare petition of a state
Dialogue#COMINIUS=To one whom they had punish'd.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Very well:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Could he say less?
Dialogue#COMINIUS=I offer'd to awaken his regard
Dialogue#COMINIUS=For's private friends: his answer to me was,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=He could not stay to pick them in a pile
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=And still to nose the offence.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=For one poor grain or two!
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
Dialogue#SICINIUS=In this so never-needed help, yet do not
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=More than the instant army we can make,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Might stop our countryman.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=No, I'll not meddle.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Pray you, go to him.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=What should I do?
Dialogue#BRUTUS=Only make trial what your love can do
Dialogue#BRUTUS=For Rome, towards Marcius.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Well, and say that Marcius
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Unheard; what then?

Dialogue#SICINIUS=Yet your good will
Dialogue#SICINIUS=must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
Dialogue#SICINIUS=As you intended well.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I'll undertake 't:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=He was not taken well; he had not dined:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
Dialogue#MENENIUS=We pout upon the morning, are unapt
Dialogue#MENENIUS=To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
Dialogue#MENENIUS=These and these conveyances of our blood
Dialogue#MENENIUS=With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Till he be dieted to my request,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And then I'll set upon him.
Dialogue#BRUTUS=You know the very road into his kindness,
Dialogue#BRUTUS=And cannot lose your way.

Dialogue#COMINIUS=The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
Dialogue#COMINIUS='Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
Dialogue#COMINIUS=So that all hope is vain.
Dialogue#COMINIUS=Unless his noble mother, and his wife;

Dialogue#MENENIUS=I am an officer of state, and come
Dialogue#MENENIUS=To speak with Coriolanus.
Dialogue#First Senator=From whence?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=From Rome.
Dialogue#First Senator=You may not pass, you must return: our general
Dialogue#First Senator=Will no more hear from thence.
Dialogue#Second Senator=You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
Dialogue#Second Senator=You'll speak with Coriolanus.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Good my friends,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.
Dialogue#First Senator=Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
Dialogue#First Senator=Is not here passable.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I tell thee, fellow,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The general is my lover: I have been
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The book of his good acts, whence men have read
Dialogue#MENENIUS=His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
Dialogue#MENENIUS=For I have ever verified my friends,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I must have leave to pass.
Dialogue#First Senator=Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his
Dialogue#First Senator=behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you
Dialogue#First Senator=should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous
Dialogue#First Senator=to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=always factionary on the party of your general.
Dialogue#Second Senator=Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
Dialogue#Second Senator=have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
Dialogue#Second Senator=say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
Dialogue#MENENIUS=speak with him till after dinner.
Dialogue#First Senator=You are a Roman, are you?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I am, as thy general is.
Dialogue#First Senator=Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,
Dialogue#First Senator=when you have pushed out your gates the very
Dialogue#First Senator=defender of them, and, in a violent popular
Dialogue#First Senator=ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to
Dialogue#First Senator=front his revenges with the easy groans of old
Dialogue#First Senator=women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with
Dialogue#First Senator=the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
Dialogue#First Senator=you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
Dialogue#First Senator=intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
Dialogue#First Senator=such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;
Dialogue#First Senator=therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your
Dialogue#First Senator=execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn
Dialogue#First Senator=you out of reprieve and pardon.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
Dialogue#MENENIUS=use me with estimation.
Dialogue#Second Senator=Come, my captain knows you not.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I mean, thy general.
Dialogue#First Senator=My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest
Dialogue#First Senator=I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's
Dialogue#First Senator=the utmost of your having: back.
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--
Notice#Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=What's the matter?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
Dialogue#MENENIUS=perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
Dialogue#MENENIUS=my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
Dialogue#MENENIUS=with him, if thou standest not i' the state of
Dialogue#MENENIUS=hanging, or of some death more long in
Dialogue#MENENIUS=spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now
Dialogue#MENENIUS=presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.
Notice#To CORIOLANUS
Dialogue#MENENIUS=The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
Dialogue#MENENIUS=particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than
Dialogue#MENENIUS=thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
Dialogue#MENENIUS=thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's
Dialogue#MENENIUS=water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to
Dialogue#MENENIUS=thee; but being assured none but myself could move
Dialogue#MENENIUS=thee, I have been blown out of your gates with
Dialogue#MENENIUS=sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy
Dialogue#MENENIUS=petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy
Dialogue#MENENIUS=wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
Dialogue#MENENIUS=here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
Dialogue#MENENIUS=access to thee.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Away!
Dialogue#MENENIUS=How! away!
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Are servanted to others: though I owe
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=My revenge properly, my remission lies
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Take this along; I writ it for thy sake
Notice#Gives a letter
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,

Dialogue#Second Senator=What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I neither care for the world nor your general: for
Dialogue#MENENIUS=such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,
Dialogue#MENENIUS=ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by
Dialogue#MENENIUS=himself fears it not from another: let your general

Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=The general suit of Rome; never admitted
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=A private whisper, no, not with such friends
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=That thought them sure of you.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=This last old man,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Loved me above the measure of a father;
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=The first conditions, which they did refuse
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=And cannot now accept; to grace him only

Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not

Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Hath an aspect of intercession, which
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces

Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=O, no more, no more!
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=You have said you will not grant us any thing;
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=For we have nothing else to ask, but that
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=That, if you fail in our request, the blame
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.

Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=And bear the palm for having bravely shed

Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Rather to show a noble grace to both parts

Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces

Dialogue#VOLUMNIA='This we received;' and each in either side
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;

Dialogue#VOLUMNIA=Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world

Dialogue#MENENIUS=his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
Dialogue#MENENIUS=his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a

Dialogue#MENENIUS=Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
Dialogue#MENENIUS=his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
Dialogue#MENENIUS=and a heaven to throne in.

Dialogue#MENENIUS=A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
Dialogue#MENENIUS=This morning for ten thousand of your throats
Dialogue#MENENIUS=I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!
Notice#Music still, with shouts
Dialogue#SICINIUS=First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=Accept my thankfulness.
Dialogue#Second Messenger=Sir, we have all
Dialogue#Second Messenger=Great cause to give great thanks.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=They are near the city?
Dialogue#Second Messenger=Almost at point to enter.
Dialogue#SICINIUS=We will meet them,
Dialogue#SICINIUS=And help the joy.
Notice#Exeunt
Banner#SCENE V. The same. A street near the gate.
Notice# c. passing over the stage, followed by Patricians and others
Dialogue#First Senator=Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
Dialogue#First Senator=Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
Dialogue#First Senator=And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
Dialogue#First Senator=Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
Dialogue#First Senator=Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
Dialogue#First Senator=Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'
Dialogue#All=Welcome, ladies, Welcome!
Notice#A flourish with drums and trumpets. Exeunt
Banner#SCENE VI. Antium. A public place.
Notice#Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, with Attendants
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Deliver them this paper: having read it,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Bid them repair to the market place; where I,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=The city ports by this hath enter'd and
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Intends to appear before the people, hoping
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=To purge herself with words: dispatch.
Notice#Exeunt Attendants
Notice#Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Most welcome!
Dialogue#First Conspirator=How is it with our general?
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Even so
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And with his charity slain.
Dialogue#Second Conspirator=Most noble sir,
Dialogue#Second Conspirator=If you do hold the same intent wherein
Dialogue#Second Conspirator=You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
Dialogue#Second Conspirator=Of your great danger.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Sir, I cannot tell:
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=We must proceed as we do find the people.
Dialogue#Third Conspirator=The people will remain uncertain whilst
Dialogue#Third Conspirator='Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
Dialogue#Third Conspirator=Makes the survivor heir of all.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=I know it;
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And my pretext to strike at him admits
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=He bow'd his nature, never known before
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=But to be rough, unswayable and free.
Dialogue#Third Conspirator=Sir, his stoutness
Dialogue#Third Conspirator=When he did stand for consul, which he lost
Dialogue#Third Conspirator=By lack of stooping,--
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=That I would have spoke of:
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=My best and freshest men; served his designments
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Which he did end all his; and took some pride
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=He waged me with his countenance, as if
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=I had been mercenary.
Dialogue#First Conspirator=So he did, my lord:
Dialogue#First Conspirator=The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,
Dialogue#First Conspirator=When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
Dialogue#First Conspirator=For no less spoil than glory,--
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=There was it:
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
Notice#Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the People
Dialogue#First Conspirator=Your native town you enter'd like a post,
Dialogue#First Conspirator=And had no welcomes home: but he returns,
Dialogue#First Conspirator=Splitting the air with noise.
Dialogue#Second Conspirator=And patient fools,
Dialogue#Second Conspirator=Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
Dialogue#Second Conspirator=With giving him glory.
Dialogue#Third Conspirator=Therefore, at your vantage,
Dialogue#Third Conspirator=Ere he express himself, or move the people
Dialogue#Third Conspirator=With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
Dialogue#Third Conspirator=Which we will second. When he lies along,
Dialogue#Third Conspirator=After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
Dialogue#Third Conspirator=His reasons with his body.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Say no more:
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Here come the lords.
Notice#Enter the Lords of the city
Dialogue#All The Lords=You are most welcome home.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=I have not deserved it.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=What I have written to you?
Dialogue#Lords=We have.
Dialogue#First Lord=And grieve to hear't.
Dialogue#First Lord=What faults he made before the last, I think
Dialogue#First Lord=Might have found easy fines: but there to end
Dialogue#First Lord=Where he was to begin and give away
Dialogue#First Lord=The benefit of our levies, answering us
Dialogue#First Lord=With our own charge, making a treaty where
Dialogue#First Lord=There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=He approaches: you shall hear him.
Notice#Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours; commoners being with him
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=No more infected with my country's love
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Under your great command. You are to know
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=That prosperously I have attempted and
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=With bloody passage led your wars even to
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Do more than counterpoise a full third part
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=The charges of the action. We have made peace
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=With no less honour to the Antiates
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Together with the seal o' the senate, what
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=We have compounded on.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Read it not, noble lords;
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=He hath abused your powers.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Traitor! how now!
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=                  Ay, traitor, Marcius!
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Marcius!
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Coriolanus in Corioli?
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=He has betray'd your business, and given up,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Breaking his oath and resolution like
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=He whined and roar'd away your victory,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Look'd wondering each at other.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Hear'st thou, Mars?
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Name not the god, thou boy of tears!
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Ha!
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=No more.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=To thrust the lie unto him.
Dialogue#First Lord=Peace, both, and hear me speak.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=Alone I did it. Boy!
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Why, noble lords,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS='Fore your own eyes and ears?
Dialogue#All Conspirators=Let him die for't.
Dialogue#All The People='Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
Dialogue#All The People=my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
Dialogue#All The People=Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'
Dialogue#Second Lord=Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
Dialogue#Second Lord=The man is noble and his fame folds-in
Dialogue#Second Lord=This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
Dialogue#Second Lord=Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
Dialogue#Second Lord=And trouble not the peace.
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=O that I had him,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
Dialogue#CORIOLANUS=To use my lawful sword!
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Insolent villain!
Dialogue#All Conspirators=Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
Notice#The Conspirators draw, and kill CORIOLANUS: AUFIDIUS stands on his body
Dialogue#Lords=Hold, hold, hold, hold!
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=My noble masters, hear me speak.
Dialogue#First Lord=O Tullus,--
Dialogue#Second Lord=Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
Dialogue#Third Lord=Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
Dialogue#Third Lord=Put up your swords.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Myself your loyal servant, or endure
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Your heaviest censure.
Dialogue#First Lord=Bear from hence his body;
Dialogue#First Lord=And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
Dialogue#First Lord=As the most noble corse that ever herald
Dialogue#First Lord=Did follow to his urn.
Dialogue#Second Lord=His own impatience
Dialogue#Second Lord=Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
Dialogue#Second Lord=Let's make the best of it.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=My rage is gone;
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Which to this hour bewail the injury,
Dialogue#AUFIDIUS=Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.
Notice#Exeunt, bearing the body of CORIOLANUS. A dead march sounded
