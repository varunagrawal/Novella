Banner#PROLOGUE
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=I come no more to make you laugh: things now,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=That bear a weighty and a serious brow,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=We now present. Those that can pity, here
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=The subject will deserve it. Such as give
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Their money out of hope they may believe,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=May here find truth too. Those that come to see
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Only a show or two, and so agree
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=The play may pass, if they be still and willing,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=I'll undertake may see away their shilling
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Richly in two short hours. Only they
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=That come to hear a merry bawdy play,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=To rank our chosen truth with such a show
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=To make that only true we now intend,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Will leave us never an understanding friend.
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=The first and happiest hearers of the town,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=The very persons of our noble story
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=As they were living; think you see them great,
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=How soon this mightiness meets misery:
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=And, if you can be merry then, I'll say
Dialogue#KING EDWARD IV=A man may weep upon his wedding-day.
Banner#SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the palace.
Notice#Enter NORFOLK at one door; at the other, BUCKINGHAM and ABERGAVENNY
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Since last we saw in France?
Dialogue#NORFOLK=I thank your grace,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Of what I saw there.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=An untimely ague
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Met in the vale of Andren.
Dialogue#NORFOLK='Twixt Guynes and Arde:
Dialogue#NORFOLK=I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung
Dialogue#NORFOLK=In their embracement, as they grew together;
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Such a compounded one?
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=All the whole time
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=I was my chamber's prisoner.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Then you lost
Dialogue#NORFOLK=The view of earthly glory: men might say,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Till this time pomp was single, but now married
Dialogue#NORFOLK=To one above itself. Each following day
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Became the next day's master, till the last
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Made former wonders its. To-day the French,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Made Britain India: every man that stood
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
Dialogue#NORFOLK=As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear
Dialogue#NORFOLK=The pride upon them, that their very labour
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Was to them as a painting: now this masque
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=As presence did present them; him in eye,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Still him in praise: and, being present both
Dialogue#NORFOLK='Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
Dialogue#NORFOLK=For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged
Dialogue#NORFOLK=The noble spirits to arms, they did perform
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Being now seen possible enough, got credit,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=That Bevis was believed.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=O, you go far.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=As I belong to worship and affect
Dialogue#NORFOLK=In honour honesty, the tract of every thing
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Would by a good discourser lose some life,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;
Dialogue#NORFOLK=To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Order gave each thing view; the office did
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Distinctly his full function.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Who did guide,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=I mean, who set the body and the limbs
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Of this great sport together, as you guess?
Dialogue#NORFOLK=One, certes, that promises no element
Dialogue#NORFOLK=In such a business.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=I pray you, who, my lord?
Dialogue#NORFOLK=All this was order'd by the good discretion
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=From his ambitious finger. What had he
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=That such a keech can with his very bulk
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And keep it from the earth.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Surely, sir,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;
Dialogue#NORFOLK=For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon
Dialogue#NORFOLK=For high feats done to the crown; neither allied
Dialogue#NORFOLK=For eminent assistants; but, spider-like,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=The force of his own merit makes his way
Dialogue#NORFOLK=A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys
Dialogue#NORFOLK=A place next to the king.
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=I cannot tell
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=Pierce into that; but I can see his pride
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=Or has given all before, and he begins
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=A new hell in himself.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Why the devil,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Upon this French going out, took he upon him,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Without the privity o' the king, to appoint
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Who should attend on him? He makes up the file
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Of all the gentry; for the most part such
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=To whom as great a charge as little honour
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=The honourable board of council out,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Must fetch him in the papers.
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=I do know
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=By this so sickened their estates, that never
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=They shall abound as formerly.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=O, many
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=For this great journey. What did this vanity
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=But minister communication of
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=A most poor issue?
Dialogue#NORFOLK=                  Grievingly I think,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=The peace between the French and us not values
Dialogue#NORFOLK=The cost that did conclude it.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Every man,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=After the hideous storm that follow'd, was
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Into a general prophecy; That this tempest,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=The sudden breach on't.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Which is budded out;
Dialogue#NORFOLK=For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=Is it therefore
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=The ambassador is silenced?
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Marry, is't.
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=A proper title of a peace; and purchased
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=At a superfluous rate!
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Why, all this business
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Our reverend cardinal carried.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Like it your grace,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=The state takes notice of the private difference
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--
Dialogue#NORFOLK=And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Honour and plenteous safety--that you read
Dialogue#NORFOLK=The cardinal's malice and his potency
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Together; to consider further that
Dialogue#NORFOLK=What his high hatred would effect wants not
Dialogue#NORFOLK=A minister in his power. You know his nature,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=That he's revengeful, and I know his sword
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
Dialogue#NORFOLK=That I advise your shunning.
Notice#Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him,  certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with  papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his  eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, both full of disdain
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Where's his examination?
Dialogue#First Secretary=Here, so please you.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Is he in person ready?
Dialogue#First Secretary=Ay, please your grace.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Well, we shall then know more; and Buckingham
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Shall lessen this big look.
Notice#Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his Train
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Outworths a noble's blood.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=What, are you chafed?
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Which your disease requires.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=I read in's looks
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Matter against me; and his eye reviled
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Me, as his abject object: at this instant
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=I'll follow and outstare him.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Stay, my lord,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=And let your reason with your choler question
Dialogue#NORFOLK=What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Requires slow pace at first: anger is like
Dialogue#NORFOLK=A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Can advise me like you: be to yourself
Dialogue#NORFOLK=As you would to your friend.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=I'll to the king;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=There's difference in no persons.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Be advised;
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
Dialogue#NORFOLK=That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=By violent swiftness, that which we run at,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=And lose by over-running. Know you not,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=The fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:
Dialogue#NORFOLK=I say again, there is no English soul
Dialogue#NORFOLK=More stronger to direct you than yourself,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=If with the sap of reason you would quench,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Or but allay, the fire of passion.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Sir,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=I am thankful to you; and I'll go along
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Whom from the flow of gall I name not but
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=From sincere motions, by intelligence,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And proofs as clear as founts in July when
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=We see each grain of gravel, I do know
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=To be corrupt and treasonous.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Say not 'treasonous.'
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=As able to perform't; his mind and place
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Only to show his pomp as well in France
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=As here at home, suggests the king our master
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=To this last costly treaty, the interview,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Did break i' the rinsing.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Faith, and so it did.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=The articles o' the combination drew
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=As himself pleased; and they were ratified
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=His fears were, that the interview betwixt
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=England and France might, through their amity,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Breed him some prejudice; for from this league
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=That he would please to alter the king's course,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And for his own advantage.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=I am sorry
Dialogue#NORFOLK=To hear this of him; and could wish he were
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Something mistaken in't.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=No, not a syllable:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=I  do pronounce him in that very shape
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=He shall appear in proof.
Notice#Enter BRANDON, a Sergeant-at-arms before him, and two or three of the Guard
Dialogue#BRANDON=Your office, sergeant; execute it.
Dialogue#Sergeant=Sir,
Dialogue#Sergeant=My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl
Dialogue#Sergeant=Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I
Dialogue#Sergeant=Arrest thee of high treason, in the name
Dialogue#Sergeant=Of our most sovereign king.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Lo, you, my lord,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Under device and practise.
Dialogue#BRANDON=I am sorry
Dialogue#BRANDON=To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on
Dialogue#BRANDON=The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure
Dialogue#BRANDON=You shall to the Tower.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=It will help me nothing
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Which makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Be done in this and all things! I obey.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!
Dialogue#BRANDON=Nay, he must bear you company. The king
Notice#To ABERGAVENNY
Dialogue#BRANDON=Is pleased you shall to the Tower, till you know
Dialogue#BRANDON=How he determines further.
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=As the duke said,
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=The will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasure
Dialogue#ABERGAVENNY=By me obey'd!
Dialogue#BRANDON=                  Here is a warrant from
Dialogue#BRANDON=The king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies
Dialogue#BRANDON=Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,
Dialogue#BRANDON=One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor--
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=So, so;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=These are the limbs o' the plot: no more, I hope.
Dialogue#BRANDON=A monk o' the Chartreux.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=O, Nicholas Hopkins?
Dialogue#BRANDON=He.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=My surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinal
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=By darkening my clear sun. My lord, farewell.
Notice#Exeunt
Banner#SCENE II. The same. The council-chamber.
Notice#Cornets. Enter KING HENRY VIII, leaning on  CARDINAL WOLSEY's shoulder, the Nobles, and LOVELL;  CARDINAL WOLSEY places himself under KING HENRY VIII's feet on his right side
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=My life itself, and the best heart of it,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Thanks you for this great care: I stood i' the level
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Of a full-charged confederacy, and give thanks
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=To you that choked it. Let be call'd before us
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I'll hear him his confessions justify;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And point by point the treasons of his master
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=He shall again relate.
Notice#A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!' Enter  QUEEN KATHARINE, ushered by NORFOLK, and SUFFOLK:  she kneels. KING HENRY VIII riseth from his state, takes her up, kisses and placeth her by him
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Nay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Arise, and take place by us: half your suit
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Never name to us; you have half our power:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The other moiety, ere you ask, is given;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Repeat your will and take it.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Thank your majesty.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=That you would love yourself, and in that love
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=The dignity of your office, is the point
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Of my petition.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=                  Lady mine, proceed.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=I am solicited, not by a few,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=And those of true condition, that your subjects
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Are in great grievance: there have been commissions
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Most bitterly on you, as putter on
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Of these exactions, yet the king our master--
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=escapes not
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=The sides of loyalty, and almost appears
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=In loud rebellion.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=                  Not almost appears,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=The clothiers all, not able to maintain
Dialogue#NORFOLK=The many to them longing, have put off
Dialogue#NORFOLK=The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger
Dialogue#NORFOLK=And lack of other means, in desperate manner
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Daring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=And danger serves among then!
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Taxation!
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Wherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=You that are blamed for it alike with us,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Know you of this taxation?
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Please you, sir,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I know but of a single part, in aught
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Pertains to the state; and front but in that file
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Where others tell steps with me.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=No, my lord,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=You know no more than others; but you frame
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=To those which would not know them, and yet must
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Most pestilent to the bearing; and, to bear 'em,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=The back is sacrifice to the load. They say
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=They are devised by you; or else you suffer
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Too hard an exclamation.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Still exaction!
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The nature of it? in what kind, let's know,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Is this exaction?
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=                  I am much too venturous
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=In tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Under your promised pardon. The subjects' grief
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Comes through commissions, which compel from each
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=The sixth part of his substance, to be levied
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Without delay; and the pretence for this
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Allegiance in them; their curses now
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=This tractable obedience is a slave
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=To each incensed will. I would your highness
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Would give it quick consideration, for
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=There is no primer business.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=By my life,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=This is against our pleasure.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And for me,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I have no further gone in this than by
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=By learned approbation of the judges. If I am
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=My faculties nor person, yet will be
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=The chronicles of my doing, let me say
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY='Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=That virtue must go through. We must not stint
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Our necessary actions, in the fear
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=To cope malicious censurers; which ever,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=For our best act. If we shall stand still,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=We should take root here where we sit, or sit
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=State-statues only.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Things done well,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And with a care, exempt themselves from fear;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Things done without example, in their issue
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Of this commission? I believe, not any.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=We must not rend our subjects from our laws,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=A trembling contribution! Why, we take
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=From every tree lop, bark, and part o' the timber;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The air will drink the sap. To every county
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Where this is question'd send our letters, with
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Free pardon to each man that has denied
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The force of this commission: pray, look to't;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I put it to your care.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=A word with you.
Notice#To the Secretary
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Let there be letters writ to every shire,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Of the king's grace and pardon. The grieved commons
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Hardly conceive of me; let it be noised
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=That through our intercession this revokement
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And pardon comes: I shall anon advise you
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Further in the proceeding.
Notice#Exit Secretary
Notice#Enter Surveyor
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Is run in your displeasure.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=It grieves many:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=To nature none more bound; his training such,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=When these so noble benefits shall prove
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Not well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Almost with ravish'd listening, could not find
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=His hour of speech a minute; he, my lady,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Hath into monstrous habits put the graces
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=That once were his, and is become as black
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear--
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=This was his gentleman in trust--of him
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The fore-recited practises; whereof
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=We cannot feel too little, hear too much.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Most like a careful subject, have collected
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Out of the Duke of Buckingham.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Speak freely.
Dialogue#Surveyor=First, it was usual with him, every day
Dialogue#Surveyor=It would infect his speech, that if the king
Dialogue#Surveyor=Should without issue die, he'll carry it so
Dialogue#Surveyor=To make the sceptre his: these very words
Dialogue#Surveyor=I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,
Dialogue#Surveyor=Lord Abergavenny; to whom by oath he menaced
Dialogue#Surveyor=Revenge upon the cardinal.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Please your highness, note
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=This dangerous conception in this point.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Not friended by by his wish, to your high person
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=His will is most malignant; and it stretches
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Beyond you, to your friends.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=My learn'd lord cardinal,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Deliver all with charity.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Speak on:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=How grounded he his title to the crown,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Upon our fail? to this point hast thou heard him
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=At any time speak aught?
Dialogue#Surveyor=He was brought to this
Dialogue#Surveyor=By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=What was that Hopkins?
Dialogue#Surveyor=Sir, a Chartreux friar,
Dialogue#Surveyor=His confessor, who fed him every minute
Dialogue#Surveyor=With words of sovereignty.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=How know'st thou this?
Dialogue#Surveyor=Not long before your highness sped to France,
Dialogue#Surveyor=The duke being at the Rose, within the parish
Dialogue#Surveyor=Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand
Dialogue#Surveyor=What was the speech among the Londoners
Dialogue#Surveyor=Concerning the French journey: I replied,
Dialogue#Surveyor=Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,
Dialogue#Surveyor=To the king's danger. Presently the duke
Dialogue#Surveyor=Said, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted
Dialogue#Surveyor='Twould prove the verity of certain words
Dialogue#Surveyor=Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he,
Dialogue#Surveyor='Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit
Dialogue#Surveyor=John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour
Dialogue#Surveyor=To hear from him a matter of some moment:
Dialogue#Surveyor=Whom after under the confession's seal
Dialogue#Surveyor=He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke
Dialogue#Surveyor=My chaplain to no creature living, but
Dialogue#Surveyor=To me, should utter, with demure confidence
Dialogue#Surveyor=This pausingly ensued: neither the king nor's heirs,
Dialogue#Surveyor=Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive
Dialogue#Surveyor=To gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke
Dialogue#Surveyor=Shall govern England.'
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=If I know you well,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=You were the duke's surveyor, and lost your office
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=You charge not in your spleen a noble person
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=And spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed;
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Yes, heartily beseech you.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Let him on.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Go forward.
Dialogue#Surveyor=     On my soul, I'll speak but truth.
Dialogue#Surveyor=I told my lord the duke, by the devil's illusions
Dialogue#Surveyor=The monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for him
Dialogue#Surveyor=To ruminate on this so far, until
Dialogue#Surveyor=It forged him some design, which, being believed,
Dialogue#Surveyor=It was much like to do: he answer'd, 'Tush,
Dialogue#Surveyor=It can do me no damage;' adding further,
Dialogue#Surveyor=That, had the king in his last sickness fail'd,
Dialogue#Surveyor=The cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads
Dialogue#Surveyor=Should have gone off.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?
Dialogue#Surveyor=I can, my liege.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=                  Proceed.
Dialogue#Surveyor=Being at Greenwich,
Dialogue#Surveyor=After your highness had reproved the duke
Dialogue#Surveyor=About Sir William Blomer,--
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I remember
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Of such a time: being my sworn servant,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The duke retain'd him his. But on; what hence?
Dialogue#Surveyor='If,' quoth he, 'I for this had been committed,
Dialogue#Surveyor=As, to the Tower, I thought, I would have play'd
Dialogue#Surveyor=The part my father meant to act upon
Dialogue#Surveyor=The usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,
Dialogue#Surveyor=Made suit to come in's presence; which if granted,
Dialogue#Surveyor=As he made semblance of his duty, would
Dialogue#Surveyor=Have put his knife to him.'
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=A giant traitor!
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Now, madam, may his highness live in freedom,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=and this man out of prison?
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=God mend all!
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=There's something more would out of thee; what say'st?
Dialogue#Surveyor=After 'the duke his father,' with 'the knife,'
Dialogue#Surveyor=He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,
Dialogue#Surveyor=Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes
Dialogue#Surveyor=He did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenor
Dialogue#Surveyor=Was,--were he evil used, he would outgo
Dialogue#Surveyor=His father by as much as a performance
Dialogue#Surveyor=Does an irresolute purpose.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=There's his period,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=To sheathe his knife in us. He is attach'd;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Call him to present trial: if he may
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Find mercy in the law, 'tis his: if none,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Let him not seek 't of us: by day and night,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=He's traitor to the height.

Dialogue#First Gentleman=That labour, sir. All's now done, but the ceremony
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Of bringing back the prisoner.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Were you there?
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Yes, indeed, was I.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Pray, speak what has happen'd.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=You may guess quickly what.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Is he found guilty?
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=I am sorry for't.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=                  So are a number more.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=But, pray, how pass'd it?
Dialogue#First Gentleman=I'll tell you in a little. The great duke
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Came to the bar; where to his accusations
Dialogue#First Gentleman=He pleaded still not guilty and alleged
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=The king's attorney on the contrary
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired
Dialogue#First Gentleman=To have brought viva voce to his face:
Dialogue#First Gentleman=At which appear'd against him his surveyor;
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Hopkins, that made this mischief.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=That was he
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=That fed him with his prophecies?
Dialogue#First Gentleman=The same.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=All these accused him strongly; which he fain
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:
Dialogue#First Gentleman=And so his peers, upon this evidence,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
Dialogue#First Gentleman=He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Was either pitied in him or forgotten.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=After all this, how did he bear himself?
Dialogue#First Gentleman=When he was brought again to the bar, to hear
Dialogue#First Gentleman=His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd
Dialogue#First Gentleman=With such an agony, he sweat extremely,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:
Dialogue#First Gentleman=But he fell to himself again, and sweetly
Dialogue#First Gentleman=In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=I do not think he fears death.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Sure, he does not:
Dialogue#First Gentleman=He never was so womanish; the cause
Dialogue#First Gentleman=He may a little grieve at.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Certainly
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=The cardinal is the end of this.
Dialogue#First Gentleman='Tis likely,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Then deputy of Ireland; who removed,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Lest he should help his father.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=That trick of state
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Was a deep envious one.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=At his return
Dialogue#First Gentleman=No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=And generally, whoever the king favours,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=The cardinal instantly will find employment,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=And far enough from court too.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=All the commons
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=The mirror of all courtesy;--
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Stay there, sir,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.

Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=You that thus far have come to pity me,

Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And if I have a co nscience, let it sink me,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=The law I bear no malice for my death;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM='T has done, upon the premises, but justice:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=For further life in this world I ne'er hope,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Is only bitter to him, only dying,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Go with me, like good angels, to my end;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name.
Dialogue#LOVELL=I do beseech your grace, for charity,
Dialogue#LOVELL=If ever any malice in your heart
Dialogue#LOVELL=Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=As I would be forgiven: I forgive all;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=There cannot be those numberless offences
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM='Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=no black envy
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Yet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Longer than I have time to tell his years!
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And when old time shall lead him to his end,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Goodness and he fill up one monument!
Dialogue#LOVELL=To the water side I must conduct your grace;
Dialogue#LOVELL=Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,

Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Yet I am richer than my base accusers,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Who first raised head against usurping Richard,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Flying for succor to his servant Banister,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=That made me happy at one stroke has taken
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=For ever from the world. I had my trial,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=A little happier than my wretched father:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most;
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=A most unnatural and faithless service!
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=This from a dying man receive as certain:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Like water from ye, never found again
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=And when you would say something that is sad,
Dialogue#BUCKINGHAM=Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!

Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Between the king and Katharine?
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Yes, but it held not:
Dialogue#First Gentleman=For when the king once heard it, out of anger
Dialogue#First Gentleman=He sent command to the lord mayor straight
Dialogue#First Gentleman=To stop the rumor, and allay those tongues
Dialogue#First Gentleman=That durst disperse it.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=But that slander, sir,
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Is found a truth now: for it grows again
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Or some about him near, have, out of malice

Dialogue#Second Gentleman=That will undo her: to confirm this too,
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;

Dialogue#First Gentleman='Tis the cardinal;
Dialogue#First Gentleman=And merely to revenge him on the emperor
Dialogue#First Gentleman=For not bestowing on him, at his asking,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=I think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruel
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Will have his will, and she must fall.
Dialogue#First Gentleman='Tis woful.

Dialogue#First Gentleman=Let's think in private more.

Dialogue#Chamberlain='My lord, the horses your lordship sent for, with
Dialogue#Chamberlain=all the care I had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and
Dialogue#Chamberlain=furnished. They were young and handsome, and of the
Dialogue#Chamberlain=best breed in the north. When they were ready to
Dialogue#Chamberlain=set out for London, a man of my lord cardinal's, by
Dialogue#Chamberlain=commission and main power, took 'em from me; with
Dialogue#Chamberlain=this reason: His master would be served before a

Dialogue#Chamberlain=Full of sad thoughts and troubles.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=What's the cause?
Dialogue#Chamberlain=It seems the marriage with his brother's wife
Dialogue#Chamberlain=Has crept too near his conscience.
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=No, his conscience
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Has crept too near another lady.
Dialogue#NORFOLK='Tis so:
Dialogue#NORFOLK=This is the cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal:
Dialogue#NORFOLK=That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Turns what he list. The king will know him one day.
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=How holily he works in all his business!
Dialogue#NORFOLK=And with what zeal! for, now he has crack'd the league
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Between us and the emperor, the queen's great nephew,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=He dives into the king's soul, and there scatters
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,

Dialogue#NORFOLK=That angels love good men with; even of her

Dialogue#SUFFOLK=As I am made without him, so I'll stand,
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=If the king please; his curses and his blessings
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Touch me alike, they're breath I not believe in.
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him

Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And worthily, my falsehood! yea, as much
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=As you have done my truth. If he know
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=That I am free of your report, he knows
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=It lies to cure me: and the cure is, to
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=His highness shall speak in, I do beseech
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And to say so no more.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=My lord, my lord,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=I am a simple woman, much too weak
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=To oppose your cunning. You're meek and
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=humble-mouth'd;
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=With meekness and humility; but your heart
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Where powers are your retainers, and your words,

Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=You tender more your person's honour than
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Your high profession spiritual: that again
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=I do refuse you for my judge; and here,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Before you all, appeal unto the pope,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,

Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Go thy ways, Kate:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=That man i' the world who shall report he has
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=A better wife, let him in nought be trusted,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=For speaking false in that: thou art, alone,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Obeying in commanding, and thy parts
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The queen of earthly queens: she's noble born;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And, like her true nobility, she has
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Carried herself towards me.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Most gracious sir,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=In humblest manner I require your highness,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=That it shall please you to declare, in hearing
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Of all these ears,--for where I am robb'd and bound,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=There must I be unloosed, although not there
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=At once and fully satisfied,--whether ever I
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Did broach this business to your highness; or
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Laid any scruple in your way, which might
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Induce you to the question on't? or ever
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Have to you, but with thanks to God for such
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Be to the prejudice of her present state,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Or touch of her good person?
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=My lord cardinal,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I free you from't. You are not to be taught
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=That you have many enemies, that know not
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Bark when their fellows do: by some of these
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The queen is put in anger. You're excused:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=But will you be more justified? You ever
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The passages made toward it: on my honour,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I will be bold with time and your attention:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=My conscience first received a tenderness,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Who had been hither sent on the debating
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Ere a determinate resolution, he,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I mean the bishop, did require a respite;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Wherein he might the king his lord advertise
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Whether our daughter were legitimate,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The region of my breast; which forced such way,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=That many mazed considerings did throng
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And press'd in with this caution. First, methought
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=If it conceived a male child by me, should
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Do no more offices of life to't than
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The grave does to the dead; for her male issue
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Or died where they were made, or shortly after
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Toward this remedy, whereupon we are
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Now present here together: that's to say,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I meant to rectify my conscience,--which
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=By all the reverend fathers of the land
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And doctors learn'd: first I began in private
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=How under my oppression I did reek,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=When I first moved you.
Dialogue#LINCOLN=Very well, my liege.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=How far you satisfied me.
Dialogue#LINCOLN=So please your highness,
Dialogue#LINCOLN=The question did at first so stagger me,
Dialogue#LINCOLN=Bearing a state of mighty moment in't
Dialogue#LINCOLN=And consequence of dread, that I committed
Dialogue#LINCOLN=The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;
Dialogue#LINCOLN=And did entreat your highness to this course
Dialogue#LINCOLN=Which you are running here.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I then moved you,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=My Lord of Canterbury; and got your leave
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=To make this present summons: unsolicited
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I left no reverend person in this court;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=But by particular consent proceeded
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=For no dislike i' the world against the person
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Of my alleged reasons, drive this forward:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And kingly dignity, we are contented
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=To wear our mortal state to come with her,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Katharine our queen, before the primest creature
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=That's paragon'd o' the world.
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=So please your highness,
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=That we adjourn this court till further day:
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Meanwhile must be an earnest motion
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Made to the queen, to call back her appeal
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=She intends unto his holiness.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=[Aside]	I may perceive
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Prithee, return: with thy approach, I know,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=My comfort comes along. Break up the court:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I say, set on.

Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Every thing that heard him play,

Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=What can be their business
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=With me, a poor weak woman, fall'n from favour?

Notice#Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Peace to your highness!
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Your graces find me here part of a housewife,

Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=May it please you noble madam, to withdraw
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Into your private chamber, we shall give you
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=The full cause of our coming.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Speak it here:
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Deserves a corner: would all other women
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=My lords, I care not, so much I am happy
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Above a number, if my actions
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Were tried by every tongue, every eye saw 'em,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Envy and base opinion set against 'em,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=I know my life so even. If your business
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=serenissima,--
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=O, good my lord, no Latin;
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=I am not such a truant since my coming,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=As not to know the language I have lived in:
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=A strange tongue makes my cause more strange,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=suspicious;
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Pray, speak in English: here are some will thank you,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake;
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Believe me, she has had much wrong: lord cardinal,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=The willing'st sin I ever yet committed
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=May be absolved in English.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Noble lady,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I am sorry my integrity should breed,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And service to his majesty and you,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=We come not by the way of accusation,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=You have too much, good lady; but to know
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=How you stand minded in the weighty difference
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Between the king and you; and to deliver,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Like free and honest men, our just opinions
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And comforts to your cause.
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Most honour'd madam,
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Forgetting, like a good man your late censure
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Both of his truth and him, which was too far,
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=His service and his counsel.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=[Aside]	To betray me.--
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=But how to make ye suddenly an answer,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,--
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=More near my life, I fear,--with my weak wit,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=And to such men of gravity and learning,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=In truth, I know not. I was set at work
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Among my maids: full little, God knows, looking
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Either for such men or such business.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=For her sake that I have been,--for I feel
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=The last fit of my greatness,--good your graces,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Let me have time and counsel for my cause:
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Your hopes and friends are infinite.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=In England
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=But little for my profit: can you think, lords,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=That any Englishman dare give me counsel?
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness' pleasure,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=They that must weigh out my afflictions,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=They that my trust must grow to, live not here:
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=They are, as all my other comforts, far hence
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=In mine own country, lords.
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=I would your grace
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=How, sir?
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Put your main cause into the king's protection;
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Both for your honour better and your cause;
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=You'll part away disgraced.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=He tells you rightly.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin:
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=That no king can corrupt.
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Your rage mistakes us.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=I will not wish ye half my miseries;
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye;
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at once
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Madam, this is a mere distraction;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=You turn the good we offer into envy.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=And all such false professors! would you have me--
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=If you have any justice, any pity;
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits--
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=And all the fellowship I hold now with him
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Is only my obedience. What can happen
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=To me above this wretchedness? all your studies
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Make me a curse like this.
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Your fears are worse.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Never yet branded with suspicion?
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Have I with all my full affections
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Still met the king? loved him next heaven?
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=obey'd him?
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Almost forgot my prayers to content him?
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Bring me a constant woman to her husband,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure;
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=And to that woman, when she has done most,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=To give up willingly that noble title
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Your master wed me to: nothing but death
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Shall e'er divorce my dignities.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Pray, hear me.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Would I had never trod this English earth,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=What will become of me now, wretched lady!
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=I am the most unhappy woman living.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=No friend, no hope; no kindred weep for me;
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=I'll hang my head and perish.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=If your grace
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=You'ld feel more comfort: why should we, good lady,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=The way of our profession is against it:
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=For goodness' sake, consider what you do;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Grow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=The hearts of princes kiss obedience,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I know you have a gentle, noble temper,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=A soul as even as a calm: pray, think us
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Madam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtues
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=With these weak women's fears: a noble spirit,
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=As yours was put into you, ever casts
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you;
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=Beware you lose it not: for us, if you please
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=To trust us in your business, we are ready
Dialogue#CARDINAL CAMPEIUS=To use our utmost  studies in your service.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Do what ye will, my lords: and, pray, forgive me,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=If I have used myself unmannerly;
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=You know I am a woman, lacking wit
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=To make a seemly answer to such persons.
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Pray, do my service to his majesty:
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=That little thought, when she set footing here,
Dialogue#QUEEN KATHARINE=She should have bought her dignities so dear.

Dialogue#NORFOLK=O, fear him not;

Dialogue#SURREY=Has the king this?
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=                  Believe it.
Dialogue#SURREY=Will this work?

Dialogue#SUFFOLK=There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Has left the cause o' the king unhandled; and
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Is posted, as the agent of our cardinal,
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=To second all his plot. I do assure you
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=The king cried Ha! at this.
Dialogue#Chamberlain=Now, God incense him,
Dialogue#Chamberlain=And let him cry Ha! louder!
Dialogue#NORFOLK=But, my lord,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=When returns Cranmer?
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=He is return'd in his opinions; which
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Have satisfied the king for his divorce,
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Together with all famous colleges
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Almost in Christendom: shortly, I believe,
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=His second marriage shall be publish'd, and
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Her coronation. Katharine no more
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Shall be call'd queen, but princess dowager
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=And widow to Prince Arthur.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=This same Cranmer's
Dialogue#NORFOLK=A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
Dialogue#NORFOLK=In the king's business.
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=He has; and we shall see him
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=For it an archbishop.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=So I hear.
Dialogue#SUFFOLK='Tis so.
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=The cardinal!
Notice#Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CROMWELL
Dialogue#NORFOLK=                  Observe, observe, he's moody.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=The packet, Cromwell.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Gave't you the king?
Dialogue#CROMWELL=To his own hand, in's bedchamber.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Look'd he o' the inside of the paper?
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Presently
Dialogue#CROMWELL=He did unseal them: and the first he view'd,
Dialogue#CROMWELL=He did it with a serious mind; a heed
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Was in his countenance. You he bade
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Attend him here this morning.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Is he ready
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=To come abroad?
Dialogue#CROMWELL=                  I think, by this he is.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Leave me awhile.
Notice#Exit CROMWELL
Notice#Aside
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=The French king's sister: he shall marry her.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Anne Bullen! No; I'll no Anne Bullens for him:
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=There's more in't than fair visage. Bullen!
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=No, we'll no Bullens. Speedily I wish
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!
Dialogue#NORFOLK=He's discontented.
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=                  May be, he hears the king
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Does whet his anger to him.
Dialogue#SURREY=Sharp enough,
Dialogue#SURREY=Lord, for thy justice!
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=[Aside]  The late queen's gentlewoman,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=a knight's daughter,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=To be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=This candle burns not clear: 'tis I must snuff it;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And well deserving? yet I know her for
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Our cause, that she should lie i' the bosom of
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Our hard-ruled king. Again, there is sprung up
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Hath crawl'd into the favour of the king,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And is his oracle.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=                  He is vex'd at something.
Dialogue#SURREY=I would 'twere something that would fret the string,
Dialogue#SURREY=The master-cord on's heart!
Notice#Enter KING HENRY VIII, reading of a schedule, and LOVELL
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=The king, the king!
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=To his own portion! and what expense by the hour
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Seems to flow from him! How, i' the name of thrift,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Saw you the cardinal?
Dialogue#NORFOLK=My lord, we have
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Stood here observing him: some strange commotion
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Then lays his finger on his temple, straight
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts
Dialogue#NORFOLK=His eye against the moon: in most strange postures
Dialogue#NORFOLK=We have seen him set himself.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=It may well be;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=There is a mutiny in's mind. This morning
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Papers of state he sent me to peruse,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=As I required: and wot you what I found
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=There,--on my conscience, put unwittingly?
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I find at such proud rate, that it out-speaks
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Possession of a subject.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=It's heaven's will:
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Some spirit put this paper in the packet,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=To bless your eye withal.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=If we did think
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=His contemplation were above the earth,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=His thinkings are below the moon, not worth
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=His serious considering.
Notice#King HENRY VIII takes his seat; whispers LOVELL, who goes to CARDINAL WOLSEY
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Heaven forgive me!
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Ever God bless your highness!
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Good my lord,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Of your best graces in your mind; the which
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=You were now running o'er: you have scarce time
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=To keep your earthly audit: sure, in that
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I deem you an ill husband, and am glad
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=To have you therein my companion.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Sir,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=For holy offices I have a time; a time
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=To think upon the part of business which
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I bear i' the state; and nature does require
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Her times of preservation, which perforce
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Must give my tendence to.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=You have said well.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And ever may your highness yoke together,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=As I will lend you cause, my doing well
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=With my well saying!
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII='Tis well said again;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=His said he did; and with his deed did crown
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=His word upon you. Since I had my office,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I have kept you next my heart; have not alone
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=But pared my present havings, to bestow
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=My bounties upon you.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=[Aside]             What should this mean?
Dialogue#SURREY=[Aside]  The Lord increase this business!
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Have I not made you,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The prime man of the state? I pray you, tell me,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=If what I now pronounce you have found true:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And, if you may confess it, say withal,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=If you are bound to us or no. What say you?
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Shower'd on me daily, have been more than could
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=My studied purposes requite; which went
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Have ever come too short of my desires,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Yet filed with my abilities: mine own ends
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Have been mine so that evermore they pointed
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=To the good of your most sacred person and
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=The profit of the state. For your great graces
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Heap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Which ever has and ever shall be growing,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Till death, that winter, kill it.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Fairly answer'd;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=A loyal and obedient subject is
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Therein illustrated: the honour of it
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Does pay the act of it; as, i' the contrary,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The foulness is the punishment. I presume
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour, more
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=On you than any; so your hand and heart,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Your brain, and every function of your power,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=As 'twere in love's particular, be more
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=To me, your friend, than any.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I do profess
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=That for your highness' good I ever labour'd
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=More than mine own; that am, have, and will be--
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Though all the world should crack their duty to you,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And throw it from their soul; though perils did
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Abound, as thick as thought could make 'em, and
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Appear in forms more horrid,--yet my duty,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=As doth a rock against the chiding flood,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Should the approach of this wild river break,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And stand unshaken yours.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII='Tis nobly spoken:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=For you have seen him open't. Read o'er this;
Notice#Giving him papers
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And after, this: and then to breakfast with
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=What appetite you have.
Notice#Exit KING HENRY VIII, frowning upon CARDINAL WOLSEY: the Nobles throng after him, smiling and whispering
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=What should this mean?
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=He parted frowning from me, as if ruin
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Leap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=This paper has undone me: 'tis the account
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Made me put this main secret in the packet
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=No new device to beat this from his brains?
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!'
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=The letter, as I live, with all the business
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And, from that full meridian of my glory,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I haste now to my setting: I shall fall
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Like a bright exhalation m the evening,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And no man see me more.
Notice#Re-enter to CARDINAL WOLSEY, NORFOLK and SUFFOLK, SURREY, and the Chamberlain
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Hear the king's pleasure, cardinal: who commands you
Dialogue#NORFOLK=To render up the great seal presently
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Into our hands; and to confine yourself
Dialogue#NORFOLK=To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Till you hear further from his highness.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Stay:
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Where's your commission, lords? words cannot carry
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Authority so weighty.
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Who dare cross 'em,
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Till I find more than will or words to do it,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I mean your malice, know, officious lords,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I dare and must deny it. Now I feel
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Of what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy:
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Follow your envious courses, men of malice;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=You have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=In time will find their fit rewards. That seal,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=You ask with such a violence, the king,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Tied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?
Dialogue#SURREY=The king, that gave it.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=It must be himself, then.
Dialogue#SURREY=Thou art a proud traitor, priest.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Proud lord, thou liest:
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Within these forty hours Surrey durst better
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Have burnt that tongue than said so.
Dialogue#SURREY=Thy ambition,
Dialogue#SURREY=Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land
Dialogue#SURREY=Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law:
Dialogue#SURREY=The heads of all thy brother cardinals,
Dialogue#SURREY=With thee and all thy best parts bound together,
Dialogue#SURREY=Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!
Dialogue#SURREY=You sent me deputy for Ireland;
Dialogue#SURREY=Far from his succor, from the king, from all
Dialogue#SURREY=That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him;
Dialogue#SURREY=Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,
Dialogue#SURREY=Absolved him with an axe.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=This, and all else
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=This talking lord can lay upon my credit,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I answer is most false. The duke by law
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Found his deserts: how innocent I was
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=From any private malice in his end,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=His noble jury and foul cause can witness.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=You have as little honesty as honour,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=That in the way of loyalty and truth
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Toward the king, my ever royal master,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And all that love his follies.
Dialogue#SURREY=By my soul,
Dialogue#SURREY=Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou
Dialogue#SURREY=shouldst feel
Dialogue#SURREY=My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords,
Dialogue#SURREY=Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?
Dialogue#SURREY=And from this fellow? if we live thus tamely,
Dialogue#SURREY=To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,
Dialogue#SURREY=Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward,
Dialogue#SURREY=And dare us with his cap like larks.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=All goodness
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Is poison to thy stomach.
Dialogue#SURREY=Yes, that goodness
Dialogue#SURREY=Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one,
Dialogue#SURREY=Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion;
Dialogue#SURREY=The goodness of your intercepted packets
Dialogue#SURREY=You writ to the pope against the king: your goodness,
Dialogue#SURREY=Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.
Dialogue#SURREY=My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,
Dialogue#SURREY=As you respect the common good, the state
Dialogue#SURREY=Of our despised nobility, our issues,
Dialogue#SURREY=Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,
Dialogue#SURREY=Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles
Dialogue#SURREY=Collected from his life. I'll startle you
Dialogue#SURREY=Worse than the scaring bell, when the brown wench
Dialogue#SURREY=Lay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=How much, methinks, I could despise this man,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=But that I am bound in charity against it!
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Those articles, my lord, are in the king's hand:
Dialogue#NORFOLK=But, thus much, they are foul ones.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=So much fairer
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And spotless shall mine innocence arise,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=When the king knows my truth.
Dialogue#SURREY=This cannot save you:
Dialogue#SURREY=I thank my memory, I yet remember
Dialogue#SURREY=Some of these articles; and out they shall.
Dialogue#SURREY=Now, if you can blush and cry 'guilty,' cardinal,
Dialogue#SURREY=You'll show a little honesty.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Speak on, sir;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I dare your worst objections: if I blush,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=It is to see a nobleman want manners.
Dialogue#SURREY=I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!
Dialogue#SURREY=First, that, without the king's assent or knowledge,
Dialogue#SURREY=You wrought to be a legate; by which power
Dialogue#SURREY=You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else
Dialogue#NORFOLK=To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'
Dialogue#NORFOLK=Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king
Dialogue#NORFOLK=To be your servant.
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Then that, without the knowledge
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Either of king or council, when you went
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=To carry into Flanders the great seal.
Dialogue#SURREY=Item, you sent a large commission
Dialogue#SURREY=To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,
Dialogue#SURREY=Without the king's will or the state's allowance,
Dialogue#SURREY=A league between his highness and Ferrara.
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=That, out of mere ambition, you have caused
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin.
Dialogue#SURREY=Then that you have sent innumerable substance--
Dialogue#SURREY=By what means got, I leave to your own conscience--
Dialogue#SURREY=To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways
Dialogue#SURREY=You have for dignities; to the mere undoing
Dialogue#SURREY=Of all the kingdom. Many more there are;
Dialogue#SURREY=Which, since they are of you, and odious,
Dialogue#SURREY=I will not taint my mouth with.
Dialogue#Chamberlain=O my lord,
Dialogue#Chamberlain=Press not a falling man too far! 'tis virtue:
Dialogue#Chamberlain=His faults lie open to the laws; let them,
Dialogue#Chamberlain=Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him
Dialogue#Chamberlain=So little of his great self.
Dialogue#SURREY=I forgive him.
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Lord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is,
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Because all those things you have done of late,
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=By your power legatine, within this kingdom,
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Fall into the compass of a praemunire,
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=That therefore such a writ be sued against you;
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be
Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Out of the king's protection. This is my charge.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=And so we'll leave you to your meditations
Dialogue#NORFOLK=How to live better. For your stubborn answer
Dialogue#NORFOLK=About the giving back the great seal to us,
Dialogue#NORFOLK=The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.
Dialogue#NORFOLK=So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.
Notice#Exeunt all but CARDINAL WOLSEY
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=So farewell to the little good you bear me.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=This many summers in a sea of glory,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=At length broke under me and now has left me,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Weary and old with service, to the mercy
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=More pangs and fears than wars or women have:
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Never to hope again.
Notice#Enter CROMWELL, and stands amazed
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Why, how now, Cromwell!
Dialogue#CROMWELL=I have no power to speak, sir.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=What, amazed
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I am fall'n indeed.
Dialogue#CROMWELL=How does your grace?
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Why, well;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I know myself now; and I feel within me
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=A peace above all earthly dignities,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=A load would sink a navy, too much honour:
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=O, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!
Dialogue#CROMWELL=I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=To endure more miseries and greater far
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=What news abroad?
Dialogue#CROMWELL=                  The heaviest and the worst
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Is your displeasure with the king.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=God bless him!
Dialogue#CROMWELL=The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Lord chancellor in your place.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=That's somewhat sudden:
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=But he's a learned man. May he continue
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Long in his highness' favour, and do justice
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more?
Dialogue#CROMWELL=That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=That's news indeed.
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Last, that the Lady Anne,
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,
Dialogue#CROMWELL=This day was view'd in open as his queen,
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Going to chapel; and the voice is now
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Only about her coronation.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=The king has gone beyond me: all my glories
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=In that one woman I have lost for ever:
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Or gild again the noble troops that waited
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=To be thy lord and master: seek the king;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Some little memory of me will stir him--
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I know his noble nature--not to let
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=For thine own future safety.
Dialogue#CROMWELL=O my lord,
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forego
Dialogue#CROMWELL=So good, so noble and so true a master?
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,
Dialogue#CROMWELL=With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.
Dialogue#CROMWELL=The king shall have my service: but my prayers
Dialogue#CROMWELL=For ever and for ever shall be yours.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Corruption wins not more than honesty.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=O Cromwell,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And,--prithee, lead me in:
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=There take an inventory of all I have,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=And my integrity to heaven, is all
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Had I but served my God with half the zeal
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=I served my king, he would not in mine age
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=Have left me naked to mine enemies.
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Good sir, have patience.
Dialogue#CARDINAL WOLSEY=So I have. Farewell

Notice#Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one another
Dialogue#First Gentleman=You're well met once again.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=So are you.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=You come to take your stand here, and behold
Dialogue#First Gentleman=The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?
Dialogue#Second Gentleman='Tis all my business. At our last encounter,
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.
Dialogue#First Gentleman='Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;
Dialogue#First Gentleman=This, general joy.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman='Tis well: the citizens,
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds--
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward--
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=In celebration of this day with shows,
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Pageants and sights of honour.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Never greater,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=May I be bold to ask at what that contains,
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=That paper in your hand?
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Yes; 'tis the list
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Of those that claim their offices this day
Dialogue#First Gentleman=By custom of the coronation.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
Dialogue#First Gentleman=To be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=I should have been beholding to your paper.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=The princess dowager? how goes her business?
Dialogue#First Gentleman=That I can tell you too. The Archbishop
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Of Canterbury, accompanied with other
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Learned and reverend fathers of his order,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off
Dialogue#First Gentleman=From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which
Dialogue#First Gentleman=She was often cited by them, but appear'd not:
Dialogue#First Gentleman=And, to be short, for not appearance and
Dialogue#First Gentleman=The king's late scruple, by the main assent
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Of all these learned men she was divorced,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=And the late marriage made of none effect
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Where she remains now sick.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Alas, good lady!

Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Who's that that bears the sceptre?
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Marquess Dorset:
Dialogue#First Gentleman=And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=A bold brave gentleman. That should be
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=The Duke of Suffolk?
Dialogue#First Gentleman='Tis the same: high-steward.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=And that my Lord of Norfolk?
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Yes;
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Heaven bless thee!
Notice#Looking on QUEEN ANNE
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Our king has all the Indies in his arms,
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=And more and richer, when he strains that lady:
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=I cannot blame his conscience.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=They that bear
Dialogue#First Gentleman=The cloth of honour over her, are four barons
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Of the Cinque-ports.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=I take it, she that carries up the train
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=It is; and all the rest are countesses.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed;
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=And sometimes falling ones.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=No more of that.
Notice#Exit procession, and then a great flourish of trumpets
Notice#Enter a third Gentleman
Dialogue#First Gentleman=God save you, sir! where have you been broiling?
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Among the crowd i' the Abbey; where a finger
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Could not be wedged in more: I am stifled
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=With the mere rankness of their joy.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=You saw
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=The ceremony?
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=                  That I did.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=How was it?
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Well worth the seeing.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Good sir, speak it to us.
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=As well as I am able. The rich stream
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=To a prepared place in the choir, fell off
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=A distance from her; while her grace sat down
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=In a rich chair of state, opposing freely
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=The beauty of her person to the people.
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=That ever lay by man: which when the people
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Had the full view of, such a noise arose
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Doublets, I think,--flew up; and had their faces
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=I never saw before. Great-bellied women,
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=That had not half a week to go, like rams
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=In the old time of war, would shake the press,
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Could say 'This is my wife' there; all were woven
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=So strangely in one piece.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=But, what follow'd?
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=At length her grace rose, and with modest paces
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Came to the altar; where she kneel'd, and saint-like
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=When by the Archbishop of Canterbury
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=She had all the royal makings of a queen;
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Laid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir,
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=With all the choicest music of the kingdom,
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=And with the same full state paced back again
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=To York-place, where the feast is held.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Sir,
Dialogue#First Gentleman=You must no more call it York-place, that's past;
Dialogue#First Gentleman=For, since the cardinal fell, that title's lost:
Dialogue#First Gentleman='Tis now the king's, and call'd Whitehall.
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=I know it;
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=But 'tis so lately alter'd, that the old name
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Is fresh about me.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=                  What two reverend bishops
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Were those that went on each side of the queen?
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Stokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester,
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Newly preferr'd from the king's secretary,
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=The other, London.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=                  He of Winchester
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Is held no great good lover of the archbishop's,
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=The virtuous Cranmer.
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=All the land knows that:
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Who may that be, I pray you?
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Thomas Cromwell;
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=A man in much esteem with the king, and truly
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=A worthy friend. The king has made him master
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=O' the jewel house,
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=And one, already, of the privy council.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=He will deserve more.
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Yes, without all doubt.
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Is to the court, and there ye shall be my guests:
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=Something I can command. As I walk thither,
Dialogue#Third Gentleman=I'll tell ye more.
Dialogue#Both=                  You may command us, sir.
Notice#Exeunt
Banner#SCENE II. Kimbolton.
Notice#Enter KATHARINE, Dowager, sick; led between GRIFFITH, her gentleman usher, and PATIENCE, her woman
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=How does your grace?
Dialogue#KATHARINE=O Griffith, sick to death!
Dialogue#KATHARINE=My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:
Dialogue#KATHARINE=So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=        Yes, madam; but I think your grace,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:
Dialogue#KATHARINE=If well, he stepp'd before me, happily
Dialogue#KATHARINE=For my example.
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=                  Well, the voice goes, madam:
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=For after the stout Earl Northumberland
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=He could not sit his mule.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Alas, poor man!
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=With all his covent, honourably received him;
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=To whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=An old man, broken with the storms of state,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Give him a little earth for charity!'
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=About the hour of eight, which he himself
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=He gave his honours to the world again,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=And yet with charity. He was a man
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;
Dialogue#KATHARINE=His own opinion was his law: i' the presence
Dialogue#KATHARINE=He would say untruths; and be ever double
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Both in his words and meaning: he was never,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:
Dialogue#KATHARINE=His promises were, as he then was, mighty;
Dialogue#KATHARINE=But his performance, as he is now, nothing:
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Of his own body he was ill, and gave
Dialogue#KATHARINE=The clergy in example.
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Noble madam,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=We write in water. May it please your highness
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=To hear me speak his good now?
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Yes, good Griffith;
Dialogue#KATHARINE=I were malicious else.
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=This cardinal,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=And though he were unsatisfied in getting,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=He was most princely: ever witness for him
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Those twins Of learning that he raised in you,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=So excellent in art, and still so rising,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=For then, and not till then, he felt himself,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=And found the blessedness of being little:
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=And, to add greater honours to his age
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Than man could give him, he died fearing God.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=After my death I wish no other herald,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=No other speaker of my living actions,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=To keep mine honour from corruption,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=With thy religious truth and modesty,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him!
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:
Dialogue#KATHARINE=I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Cause the musicians play me that sad note
Dialogue#KATHARINE=I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating
Dialogue#KATHARINE=On that celestial harmony I go to.
Notice#Sad and solemn music
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=She is asleep: good wench, let's sit down quiet,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=For fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience.
Notice#The vision. Enter, solemnly tripping one after  another, six personages, clad in white robes,  wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden  vizards on their faces; branches of bays or palm in  their hands. They first congee unto her, then  dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold  a spare garland over her head; at which the other  four make reverent curtsies; then the two that held  the garland deliver the same to the other next two,  who observe the same order in their changes, and  holding the garland over her head: which done,  they deliver the same garland to the last two, who  likewise observe the same order: at which, as it  were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs  of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven:  and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them. The music continues
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Spirits of peace, where are ye? are ye all gone,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Madam, we are here.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=It is not you I call for:
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Saw ye none enter since I slept?
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=None, madam.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?
Dialogue#KATHARINE=They promised me eternal happiness;
Dialogue#KATHARINE=And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel
Dialogue#KATHARINE=I am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly.
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Possess your fancy.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Bid the music leave,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=They are harsh and heavy to me.
Notice#Music ceases
Dialogue#PATIENCE=Do you note
Dialogue#PATIENCE=How much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?
Dialogue#PATIENCE=How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,
Dialogue#PATIENCE=And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=She is going, wench: pray, pray.
Dialogue#PATIENCE=Heaven comfort her!
Notice#Enter a Messenger
Dialogue#Messenger=An't like your grace,--
Dialogue#KATHARINE=You are a saucy fellow:
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Deserve we no more reverence?
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=You are to blame,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,
Dialogue#GRIFFITH=To use so rude behavior; go to, kneel.
Dialogue#Messenger=I humbly do entreat your highness' pardon;
Dialogue#Messenger=My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying
Dialogue#Messenger=A gentleman, sent from the king, to see you.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Admit him entrance, Griffith: but this fellow
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Let me ne'er see again.
Notice#Exeunt GRIFFITH and Messenger
Notice#Re-enter GRIFFITH, with CAPUCIUS
Dialogue#KATHARINE=If my sight fail not,

Dialogue#CAPUCIUS=Madam, the same; your servant.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=O, my lord,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=The times and titles now are alter'd strangely
Dialogue#KATHARINE=With me since first you knew me. But, I pray you,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=What is your pleasure with me?
Dialogue#CAPUCIUS=Noble lady,
Dialogue#CAPUCIUS=First mine own service to your grace; the next,
Dialogue#CAPUCIUS=The king's request that I would visit you;
Dialogue#CAPUCIUS=Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me
Dialogue#CAPUCIUS=Sends you his princely commendations,
Dialogue#CAPUCIUS=And heartily entreats you take good comfort.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;
Dialogue#KATHARINE='Tis like a pardon after execution:
Dialogue#KATHARINE=That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;
Dialogue#KATHARINE=But now I am past an comforts here, but prayers.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=How does his highness?
Dialogue#CAPUCIUS=Madam, in good health.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=So may he ever do! and ever flourish,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=When I shal l dwell with worms, and my poor name
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Banish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=I caused you write, yet sent away?
Dialogue#PATIENCE=No, madam.
Notice#Giving it to KATHARINE
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver
Dialogue#KATHARINE=This to my lord the king.
Dialogue#CAPUCIUS=Most willing, madam.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=In which I have commended to his goodness
Dialogue#KATHARINE=The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter;
Dialogue#KATHARINE=The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding--
Dialogue#KATHARINE=She is young, and of a noble modest nature,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=I hope she will deserve well,--and a little
Dialogue#KATHARINE=To love her for her mother's sake, that loved him,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Is, that his noble grace would have some pity
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Upon my wretched women, that so long
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Of which there is not one, I dare avow,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=And now I should not lie, but will deserve
Dialogue#KATHARINE=For virtue and true beauty of the soul,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=For honesty and decent carriage,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=A right good husband, let him be a noble
Dialogue#KATHARINE=And, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=The last is, for my men; they are the poorest,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=But poverty could never draw 'em from me;
Dialogue#KATHARINE=That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=And something over to remember me by:
Dialogue#KATHARINE=If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
Dialogue#KATHARINE=And able means, we had not parted thus.
Dialogue#KATHARINE=These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=By that you love the dearest in this world,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the king
Dialogue#KATHARINE=To do me this last right.
Dialogue#CAPUCIUS=By heaven, I will,
Dialogue#CAPUCIUS=Or let me lose the fashion of a man!
Dialogue#KATHARINE=I thank you, honest lord. Remember me
Dialogue#KATHARINE=In all humility unto his highness:
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Say his long trouble now is passing
Dialogue#KATHARINE=Out of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,
Dialogue#KATHARINE=You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;

Dialogue#KATHARINE=Let me be used with honour: strew me over
Dialogue#KATHARINE=With maiden flowers, that all the world may know
Dialogue#KATHARINE=I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,

Dialogue#GARDINER=It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?
Dialogue#Boy=It hath struck.
Dialogue#GARDINER=These should be hours for necessities,
Dialogue#GARDINER=Not for delights; times to repair our nature
Dialogue#GARDINER=With comforting repose, and not for us
Dialogue#GARDINER=To waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!
Dialogue#GARDINER=Whither so late?
Dialogue#LOVELL=                  Came you from the king, my lord
Dialogue#GARDINER=I did, Sir Thomas: and left him at primero
Dialogue#GARDINER=With the Duke of Suffolk.
Dialogue#LOVELL=I must to him too,
Dialogue#LOVELL=Before he go to bed. I'll take my leave.
Dialogue#GARDINER=Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What's the matter?
Dialogue#GARDINER=It seems you are in haste: an if there be
Dialogue#GARDINER=No great offence belongs to't, give your friend
Dialogue#GARDINER=Some touch of your late business: affairs, that walk,
Dialogue#GARDINER=As they say spirits do, at midnight, have
Dialogue#GARDINER=In them a wilder nature than the business
Dialogue#GARDINER=That seeks dispatch by day.
Dialogue#LOVELL=My lord, I love you;
Dialogue#LOVELL=And durst commend a secret to your ear
Dialogue#LOVELL=Much weightier than this work. The queen's in labour,
Dialogue#LOVELL=They say, in great extremity; and fear'd
Dialogue#LOVELL=She'll with the labour end.
Dialogue#GARDINER=The fruit she goes with
Dialogue#GARDINER=I pray for heartily, that it may find
Dialogue#GARDINER=Good time, and live: but for the stock, Sir Thomas,
Dialogue#GARDINER=I wish it grubb'd up now.
Dialogue#LOVELL=Methinks I could
Dialogue#LOVELL=Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says
Dialogue#LOVELL=She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
Dialogue#LOVELL=Deserve our better wishes.
Dialogue#GARDINER=But, sir, sir,
Dialogue#GARDINER=Hear me, Sir Thomas: you're a gentleman

Dialogue#LOVELL=O' the rolls, and the king's secretary; further, sir,
Dialogue#LOVELL=Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments,

Dialogue#LOVELL=One syllable against him?
Dialogue#GARDINER=Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,
Dialogue#GARDINER=There are that dare; and I myself have ventured

Dialogue#GARDINER=Incensed the lords o' the council, that he is,
Dialogue#GARDINER=For so I know he is, they know he is,
Dialogue#GARDINER=A most arch heretic, a pestilence

Dialogue#GARDINER=Have broken with the king; who hath so far
Dialogue#GARDINER=Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace
Dialogue#GARDINER=And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs
Dialogue#GARDINER=Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded
Dialogue#GARDINER=To-morrow morning to the council-board
Dialogue#GARDINER=He be convented. He's a rank weed, Sir Thomas,

Dialogue#Chancellor=Of our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty

Dialogue#Chancellor=Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,
Dialogue#Chancellor=Toward the king first, then his laws, in filling
Dialogue#Chancellor=The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains,
Dialogue#Chancellor=For so we are inform'd, with new opinions,
Dialogue#Chancellor=Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,
Dialogue#Chancellor=And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.
Dialogue#GARDINER=Which reformation must be sudden too,
Dialogue#GARDINER=My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses
Dialogue#GARDINER=Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,
Dialogue#GARDINER=But stop their mouths with stubborn bits, and spur 'em,

Dialogue#CRANMER=My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress
Dialogue#CRANMER=Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,
Dialogue#CRANMER=And with no little study, that my teaching
Dialogue#CRANMER=And the strong course of my authority
Dialogue#CRANMER=Might go one way, and safely; and the end
Dialogue#CRANMER=Was ever, to do well: nor is there living,
Dialogue#CRANMER=I speak it with a single heart, my lords,
Dialogue#CRANMER=A man that more detests, more stirs against,
Dialogue#CRANMER=Both in his private conscience and his place,
Dialogue#CRANMER=Defacers of a public peace, than I do.
Dialogue#CRANMER=Pray heaven, the king may never find a heart

Dialogue#SUFFOLK=Nay, my lord,

Dialogue#SUFFOLK=And, by that virtue, no man dare accuse you.
Dialogue#GARDINER=My lord, because we have business of more moment,
Dialogue#GARDINER=We will be short with you. 'Tis his highness' pleasure,

Dialogue#CRANMER=You are always my good friend; if your will pass,
Dialogue#CRANMER=I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,
Dialogue#CRANMER=You are so merciful: I see your end;
Dialogue#CRANMER='Tis my undoing: love and meekness, lord,

Dialogue#CRANMER=Win straying souls with modesty again,
Dialogue#CRANMER=Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,
Dialogue#CRANMER=Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,
Dialogue#CRANMER=I make as little doubt, as you do conscience
Dialogue#CRANMER=In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,
Dialogue#CRANMER=But reverence to your calling makes me modest.
Dialogue#GARDINER=My lord, my lord, you are a sectary,
Dialogue#GARDINER=That's the plain truth: your painted gloss discovers,
Dialogue#GARDINER=To men that understand you, words and weakness.
Dialogue#CROMWELL=My Lord of Winchester, you are a little,
Dialogue#CROMWELL=By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,
Dialogue#CROMWELL=However faulty, yet should find respect
Dialogue#CROMWELL=For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty
Dialogue#CROMWELL=To load a falling man.
Dialogue#GARDINER=Good master secretary,
Dialogue#GARDINER=I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst
Dialogue#GARDINER=Of all this table, say so.
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Why, my lord?
Dialogue#GARDINER=Do not I know you for a favourer
Dialogue#GARDINER=Of this new sect? ye are not sound.
Dialogue#CROMWELL=Not sound?
Dialogue#GARDINER=Not sound, I say.
Dialogue#CROMWELL=                  Would you were half so honest!

Dialogue#CRANMER=By virtue of that ring, I take my cause
Dialogue#CRANMER=Out of the gripes of cruel men, and give it

Dialogue#GARDINER=The chief aim of his honour; and, to strengthen
Dialogue#GARDINER=That holy duty, out of dear respect,
Dialogue#GARDINER=His royal self in judgment comes to hear

Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=This good man,--few of you deserve that title,--
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=At chamber--door? and one as great as you are?

Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Power as he was a counsellor to try him,

Dialogue#Chancellor=To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed
Dialogue#Chancellor=Concerning his imprisonment, was rather,

Dialogue#Man=of pebbles, that I was fain to draw mine honour in,
Dialogue#Man=and let 'em win the work: the devil was amongst
Dialogue#Man='em, I think, surely.
Dialogue#Porter=These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse,
Dialogue#Porter=and fight for bitten apples; that no audience, but
Dialogue#Porter=the tribulation of Tower-hill, or the limbs of
Dialogue#Porter=Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure.
Dialogue#Porter=I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum, and there they
Dialogue#Porter=are like to dance these three days; besides the
Dialogue#Porter=running banquet of two beadles that is to come.
Notice#Enter Chamberlain
Dialogue#Chamberlain=Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here!
Dialogue#Chamberlain=They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,
Dialogue#Chamberlain=As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,
Dialogue#Chamberlain=These lazy knaves? Ye have made a fine hand, fellows:
Dialogue#Chamberlain=There's a trim rabble let in: are all these
Dialogue#Chamberlain=Your faithful friends o' the suburbs? We shall have
Dialogue#Chamberlain=Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,
Dialogue#Chamberlain=When they pass back from the christening.
Dialogue#Porter=An't please
Dialogue#Porter=your honour,
Dialogue#Porter=We are but men; and what so many may do,
Dialogue#Porter=Not being torn a-pieces, we have done:
Dialogue#Porter=An army cannot rule 'em.
Dialogue#Chamberlain=As I live,
Dialogue#Chamberlain=If the king blame me for't, I'll lay ye all
Dialogue#Chamberlain=By the heels, and suddenly; and on your heads
Dialogue#Chamberlain=Clap round fines for neglect: ye are lazy knaves;
Dialogue#Chamberlain=And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when
Dialogue#Chamberlain=Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;
Dialogue#Chamberlain=They're come already from the christening:
Dialogue#Chamberlain=Go, break among the press, and find a way out
Dialogue#Chamberlain=To let the troop pass fairly; or I'll find
Dialogue#Chamberlain=A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.
Dialogue#Porter=Make way there for the princess.
Dialogue#Man=You great fellow,
Dialogue#Man=Stand close up, or I'll make your head ache.
Dialogue#Porter=You i' the camlet, get up o' the rail;
Dialogue#Porter=I'll peck you o'er the pales else.

Notice#Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VIII and Guard
Dialogue#CRANMER=[Kneeling] And to your royal grace, and the good queen,
Dialogue#CRANMER=My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:
Dialogue#CRANMER=All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,
Dialogue#CRANMER=Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,
Dialogue#CRANMER=May hourly fall upon ye!
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Thank you, good lord archbishop:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=What is her name?
Dialogue#CRANMER=                  Elizabeth.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Stand up, lord.
Notice#KING HENRY VIII kisses the child
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Into whose hand I give thy life.
Dialogue#CRANMER=Amen.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=My noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=When she has so much English.
Dialogue#CRANMER=Let me speak, sir,
Dialogue#CRANMER=For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter
Dialogue#CRANMER=Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.
Dialogue#CRANMER=This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--
Dialogue#CRANMER=Though in her cradle, yet now promises
Dialogue#CRANMER=Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,
Dialogue#CRANMER=Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--
Dialogue#CRANMER=But few now living can behold that goodness--
Dialogue#CRANMER=A pattern to all princes living with her,
Dialogue#CRANMER=And all that shall succeed: Saba was never
Dialogue#CRANMER=More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
Dialogue#CRANMER=Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,
Dialogue#CRANMER=That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,
Dialogue#CRANMER=With all the virtues that attend the good,
Dialogue#CRANMER=Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,
Dialogue#CRANMER=Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:
Dialogue#CRANMER=She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;
Dialogue#CRANMER=Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,
Dialogue#CRANMER=And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:
Dialogue#CRANMER=In her days every man shall eat in safety,
Dialogue#CRANMER=Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing
Dialogue#CRANMER=The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:
Dialogue#CRANMER=God shall be truly known; and those about her
Dialogue#CRANMER=From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,
Dialogue#CRANMER=And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.
Dialogue#CRANMER=Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when
Dialogue#CRANMER=The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,
Dialogue#CRANMER=Her ashes new create another heir,
Dialogue#CRANMER=As great in admiration as herself;
Dialogue#CRANMER=So shall she leave her blessedness to one,
Dialogue#CRANMER=When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,
Dialogue#CRANMER=Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
Dialogue#CRANMER=Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,
Dialogue#CRANMER=And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,
Dialogue#CRANMER=That were the servants to this chosen infant,
Dialogue#CRANMER=Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:
Dialogue#CRANMER=Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,
Dialogue#CRANMER=His honour and the greatness of his name
Dialogue#CRANMER=Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,
Dialogue#CRANMER=And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches
Dialogue#CRANMER=To all the plains about him: our children's children
Dialogue#CRANMER=Shall see this, and bless heaven.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Thou speakest wonders.
Dialogue#CRANMER=She shall be, to the happiness of England,
Dialogue#CRANMER=An aged princess; many days shall see her,
Dialogue#CRANMER=And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
Dialogue#CRANMER=Would I had known no more! but she must die,
Dialogue#CRANMER=She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,
Dialogue#CRANMER=A most unspotted lily shall she pass
Dialogue#CRANMER=To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=O lord archbishop,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Thou hast made me now a man! never, before
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=This happy child, did I get any thing:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=That when I am in heaven I shall desire
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And your good brethren, I am much beholding;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=I have received much honour by your presence,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=She will be sick else. This day, no man think
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Has business at his house; for all shall stay:
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=This little one shall make it holiday.

Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=EPILOGUE
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII='Tis ten to one this play can never please
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=All that are here: some come to take their ease,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=We have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=They'll say 'tis naught: others, to hear the city
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Abused extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=Which we have not done neither: that, I fear,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=All the expected good we're like to hear
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=For this play at this time, is only in
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=The merciful construction of good women;
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=And say 'twill do, I know, within a while
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap,
Dialogue#KING HENRY VIII=If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.
