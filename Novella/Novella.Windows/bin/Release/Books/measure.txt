Notice#Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and Attendants
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Escalus.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=My lord.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Of government the properties to unfold,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Since I am put to know that your own science
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=My strength can give you: then no more remains,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And let them work. The nature of our people,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Our city's institutions, and the terms
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For common justice, you're as pregnant in
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=As art and practise hath enriched any
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That we remember. There is our commission,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I say, bid come before us Angelo.
Notice#Exit an Attendant
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=What figure of us think you he will bear?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For you must know, we have with special soul
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Elected him our absence to supply,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And given his deputation all the organs
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Of our own power: what think you of it?
Dialogue#ESCALUS=If any in Vienna be of worth
Dialogue#ESCALUS=To undergo such ample grace and honour,
Dialogue#ESCALUS=It is Lord Angelo.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=                  Look where he comes.
Notice#Enter ANGELO
Dialogue#ANGELO=Always obedient to your grace's will,
Dialogue#ANGELO=I come to know your pleasure.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Angelo,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=There is a kind of character in thy life,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That to the observer doth thy history
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=The smallest scruple of her excellence
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Herself the glory of a creditor,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To one that can my part in him advertise;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Hold therefore, Angelo:--
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Take thy commission.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Now, good my lord,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Let there be some more test made of my metal,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Before so noble and so great a figure
Dialogue#ANGELO=Be stamp'd upon it.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=No more evasion:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=As time and our concernings shall importune,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=How it goes with us, and do look to know
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To the hopeful execution do I leave you
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Of your commissions.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Yet give leave, my lord,
Dialogue#ANGELO=That we may bring you something on the way.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=My haste may not admit it;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=So to enforce or qualify the laws
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I'll privily away. I love the people,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Through it do well, I do not relish well
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.
Dialogue#ANGELO=The heavens give safety to your purposes!
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
Dialogue#DUKE=I thank you. Fare you well.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#ESCALUS=I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
Dialogue#ESCALUS=To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
Dialogue#ESCALUS=To look into the bottom of my place:
Dialogue#ESCALUS=A power I have, but of what strength and nature
Dialogue#ESCALUS=I am not yet instructed.
Dialogue#ANGELO='Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
Dialogue#ANGELO=And we may soon our satisfaction have
Dialogue#ANGELO=Touching that point.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=I'll wait upon your honour.

Notice#Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen
Dialogue#LUCIO=If the duke with the other dukes come not to
Dialogue#LUCIO=composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
Dialogue#LUCIO=the dukes fall upon the king.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Hungary's!
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Amen.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
Dialogue#LUCIO=went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
Dialogue#LUCIO=one out of the table.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman='Thou shalt not steal'?
Dialogue#LUCIO=Ay, that he razed.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and
Dialogue#First Gentleman=all the rest from their functions: they put forth
Dialogue#First Gentleman=to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
Dialogue#First Gentleman=the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
Dialogue#First Gentleman=well that prays for peace.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=I never heard any soldier dislike it.
Dialogue#LUCIO=I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where
Dialogue#LUCIO=grace was said.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=No? a dozen times at least.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=What, in metre?
Dialogue#LUCIO=In any proportion or in any language.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=I think, or in any religion.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
Dialogue#LUCIO=controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a
Dialogue#LUCIO=wicked villain, despite of all grace.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
Dialogue#LUCIO=I grant; as there may between the lists and the
Dialogue#LUCIO=velvet. Thou art the list.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
Dialogue#First Gentleman=a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
Dialogue#First Gentleman=be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou
Dialogue#First Gentleman=art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
Dialogue#First Gentleman=feelingly now?
Dialogue#LUCIO=I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
Dialogue#LUCIO=feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
Dialogue#LUCIO=confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
Dialogue#LUCIO=live, forget to drink after thee.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
Dialogue#LUCIO=have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=To what, I pray?
Dialogue#LUCIO=Judge.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=To three thousand dolours a year.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Ay, and more.
Dialogue#LUCIO=A French crown more.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou
Dialogue#First Gentleman=art full of error; I am sound.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
Dialogue#LUCIO=things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
Dialogue#LUCIO=impiety has made a feast of thee.
Notice#Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE
Dialogue#First Gentleman=How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=to prison was worth five thousand of you all.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Who's that, I pray thee?
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=him carried away; and, which is more, within these
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=three days his head to be chopped off.
Dialogue#LUCIO=But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Art thou sure of this?
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=Julietta with child.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two
Dialogue#LUCIO=hours since, and he was ever precise in
Dialogue#LUCIO=promise-keeping.
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
Dialogue#Second Gentleman=speech we had to such a purpose.
Dialogue#First Gentleman=But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Away! let's go learn the truth of it.
Notice#Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=custom-shrunk.
Notice#Enter POMPEY
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=How now! what's the news with you?
Dialogue#POMPEY=Yonder man is carried to prison.
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=Well; what has he done?
Dialogue#POMPEY=A woman.
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=But what's his offence?
Dialogue#POMPEY=Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=What, is there a maid with child by him?
Dialogue#POMPEY=No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have
Dialogue#POMPEY=not heard of the proclamation, have you?
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=What proclamation, man?
Dialogue#POMPEY=All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=And what shall become of those in the city?
Dialogue#POMPEY=They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
Dialogue#POMPEY=but that a wise burgher put in for them.
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=pulled down?
Dialogue#POMPEY=To the ground, mistress.
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=What shall become of me?
Dialogue#POMPEY=Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
Dialogue#POMPEY=clients: though you change your place, you need not
Dialogue#POMPEY=change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
Dialogue#POMPEY=have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
Dialogue#POMPEY=will be considered.
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to
Dialogue#POMPEY=prison; and there's Madam Juliet.
Notice#Exeunt
Notice#Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Bear me to prison, where I am committed.
Dialogue#Provost=I do it not in evil disposition,
Dialogue#Provost=But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Thus can the demigod Authority
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Make us pay down for our offence by weight
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.
Notice#Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen
Dialogue#LUCIO=Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=As surfeit is the father of much fast,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=So every scope by the immoderate use
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
Dialogue#LUCIO=If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
Dialogue#LUCIO=send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
Dialogue#LUCIO=the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
Dialogue#LUCIO=as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy
Dialogue#LUCIO=offence, Claudio?
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=What but to speak of would offend again.
Dialogue#LUCIO=What, is't murder?
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=No.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Lechery?
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Call it so.
Dialogue#Provost=Away, sir! you must go.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.
Dialogue#LUCIO=A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Is lechery so look'd after?
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=I got possession of Julietta's bed:
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Save that we do the denunciation lack
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Of outward order: this we came not to,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Only for propagation of a dower
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Till time had made them for us. But it chances
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
Dialogue#LUCIO=With child, perhaps?
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Unhappily, even so.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=And the new deputy now for the duke--
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Or whether that the body public be
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Whether the tyranny be in his place,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Or in his emmence that fills it up,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=I stagger in:--but this new governor
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.
Dialogue#LUCIO=I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
Dialogue#LUCIO=thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,
Dialogue#LUCIO=may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
Dialogue#LUCIO=him.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=I have done so, but he's not to be found.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=This day my sister should the cloister enter
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=And there receive her approbation:
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Acquaint her with the danger of my state:
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=I have great hope in that; for in her youth
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=There is a prone and speechless dialect,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=When she will play with reason and discourse,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=And well she can persuade.
Dialogue#LUCIO=I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the
Dialogue#LUCIO=like, which else would stand under grievous
Dialogue#LUCIO=imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
Dialogue#LUCIO=would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
Dialogue#LUCIO=game of tick-tack. I'll to her.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=I thank you, good friend Lucio.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Within two hours.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=                  Come, officer, away!

Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=No, holy father; throw away that thought;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Of burning youth.
Dialogue#FRIAR THOMAS=                  May your grace speak of it?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=My holy sir, none better knows than you
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=How I have ever loved the life removed
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=You will demand of me why I do this?
Dialogue#FRIAR THOMAS=Gladly, my lord.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Only to stick it in their children's sight
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Goes all decorum.
Dialogue#FRIAR THOMAS=                  It rested in your grace
Dialogue#FRIAR THOMAS=To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
Dialogue#FRIAR THOMAS=And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
Dialogue#FRIAR THOMAS=Than in Lord Angelo.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I do fear, too dreadful:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO='Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=When evil deeds have their permissive pass
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I have on Angelo imposed the office;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And yet my nature never in the fight
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Supply me with the habit and instruct me
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=How I may formally in person bear me
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=At our more leisure shall I render you;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That his blood flows, or that his appetite
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

Dialogue#ISABELLA=And have you nuns no farther privileges?
Dialogue#FRANCISCA=Are not these large enough?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;
Dialogue#ISABELLA=But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.
Dialogue#LUCIO=[Within]  Ho! Peace be in this place!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Who's that which calls?
Dialogue#FRANCISCA=It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
Dialogue#FRANCISCA=Turn you the key, and know his business of him;
Dialogue#FRANCISCA=You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
Dialogue#FRANCISCA=When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
Dialogue#FRANCISCA=But in the presence of the prioress:
Dialogue#FRANCISCA=Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
Dialogue#FRANCISCA=Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.

Dialogue#LUCIO=Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
Dialogue#LUCIO=As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
Dialogue#LUCIO=A novice of this place and the fair sister
Dialogue#LUCIO=To her unhappy brother Claudio?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=The rather for I now must make you know
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I am that Isabella and his sister.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
Dialogue#LUCIO=Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Woe me! for what?
Dialogue#LUCIO=For that which, if myself might be his judge,
Dialogue#LUCIO=He should receive his punishment in thanks:
Dialogue#LUCIO=He hath got his friend with child.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Sir, make me not your story.
Dialogue#LUCIO=It is true.
Dialogue#LUCIO=I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
Dialogue#LUCIO=With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
Dialogue#LUCIO=Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
Dialogue#LUCIO=I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
Dialogue#LUCIO=By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
Dialogue#LUCIO=And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
Dialogue#LUCIO=As with a saint.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
Dialogue#LUCIO=Your brother and his lover have embraced:
Dialogue#LUCIO=As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
Dialogue#LUCIO=That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
Dialogue#LUCIO=To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
Dialogue#LUCIO=Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
Dialogue#LUCIO=Is she your cousin?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
Dialogue#ISABELLA=By vain though apt affection.
Dialogue#LUCIO=She it is.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=O, let him marry her.
Dialogue#LUCIO=This is the point.
Dialogue#LUCIO=The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
Dialogue#LUCIO=Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
Dialogue#LUCIO=In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
Dialogue#LUCIO=By those that know the very nerves of state,
Dialogue#LUCIO=His givings-out were of an infinite distance
Dialogue#LUCIO=From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
Dialogue#LUCIO=And with full line of his authority,
Dialogue#LUCIO=Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
Dialogue#LUCIO=Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
Dialogue#LUCIO=The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
Dialogue#LUCIO=But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
Dialogue#LUCIO=With profits of the mind, study and fast.
Dialogue#LUCIO=He--to give fear to use and liberty,
Dialogue#LUCIO=Which have for long run by the hideous law,
Dialogue#LUCIO=As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
Dialogue#LUCIO=Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
Dialogue#LUCIO=Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
Dialogue#LUCIO=And follows close the rigour of the statute,
Dialogue#LUCIO=To make him an example. All hope is gone,
Dialogue#LUCIO=Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
Dialogue#LUCIO=To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
Dialogue#LUCIO='Twixt you and your poor brother.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Doth he so seek his life?
Dialogue#LUCIO=Has censured him
Dialogue#LUCIO=Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
Dialogue#LUCIO=A warrant for his execution.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Alas! what poor ability's in me
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To do him good?
Dialogue#LUCIO=                  Assay the power you have.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=My power? Alas, I doubt--
Dialogue#LUCIO=Our doubts are traitors
Dialogue#LUCIO=And make us lose the good we oft might win
Dialogue#LUCIO=By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
Dialogue#LUCIO=And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
Dialogue#LUCIO=Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
Dialogue#LUCIO=All their petitions are as freely theirs
Dialogue#LUCIO=As they themselves would owe them.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I'll see what I can do.
Dialogue#LUCIO=But speedily.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I will about it straight;
Dialogue#ISABELLA=No longer staying but to give the mother
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Commend me to my brother: soon at night
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I'll send him certain word of my success.

Dialogue#ANGELO=Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
Dialogue#ANGELO=That justice seizes: what know the laws
Dialogue#ANGELO=That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
Dialogue#ANGELO=The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
Dialogue#ANGELO=Because we see it; but what we do not see
Dialogue#ANGELO=We tread upon, and never think of it.
Dialogue#ANGELO=You may not so extenuate his offence
Dialogue#ANGELO=For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
Dialogue#ANGELO=When I, that censure him, do so offend,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
Dialogue#ANGELO=And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Be it as your wisdom will.

Notice#Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY
Dialogue#ELBOW=Come, bring them away: if these be good people in
Dialogue#ELBOW=a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
Dialogue#ELBOW=common houses, I know no law: bring them away.
Dialogue#ANGELO=How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?
Dialogue#ELBOW=If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's
Dialogue#ELBOW=constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
Dialogue#ELBOW=justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
Dialogue#ELBOW=honour two notorious benefactors.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
Dialogue#ANGELO=they not malefactors?
Dialogue#ELBOW=If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
Dialogue#ELBOW=are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure
Dialogue#ELBOW=of; and void of all profanation in the world that
Dialogue#ELBOW=good Christians ought to have.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=This comes off well; here's a wise officer.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
Dialogue#ANGELO=name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?
Dialogue#POMPEY=He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.
Dialogue#ANGELO=What are you, sir?
Dialogue#ELBOW=He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
Dialogue#ELBOW=serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
Dialogue#ELBOW=say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she
Dialogue#ELBOW=professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=How know you that?
Dialogue#ELBOW=My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--
Dialogue#ESCALUS=How? thy wife?
Dialogue#ELBOW=Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Dost thou detest her therefore?
Dialogue#ELBOW=I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as
Dialogue#ELBOW=she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
Dialogue#ELBOW=it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=How dost thou know that, constable?
Dialogue#ELBOW=Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
Dialogue#ELBOW=cardinally given, might have been accused in
Dialogue#ELBOW=fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=By the woman's means?
Dialogue#ELBOW=Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
Dialogue#ELBOW=spit in his face, so she defied him.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.
Dialogue#ELBOW=Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable
Dialogue#ELBOW=man; prove it.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Do you hear how he misplaces?
Dialogue#POMPEY=Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
Dialogue#POMPEY=saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;
Dialogue#POMPEY=sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
Dialogue#POMPEY=distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
Dialogue#POMPEY=dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
Dialogue#POMPEY=such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very
Dialogue#POMPEY=good dishes,--
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.
Dialogue#POMPEY=No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
Dialogue#POMPEY=the right: but to the point. As I say, this
Dialogue#POMPEY=Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
Dialogue#POMPEY=being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
Dialogue#POMPEY=prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
Dialogue#POMPEY=Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
Dialogue#POMPEY=rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very
Dialogue#POMPEY=honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could
Dialogue#POMPEY=not give you three-pence again.
Dialogue#FROTH=No, indeed.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
Dialogue#POMPEY=cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--
Dialogue#FROTH=Ay, so I did indeed.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be
Dialogue#POMPEY=remembered, that such a one and such a one were past
Dialogue#POMPEY=cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
Dialogue#POMPEY=good diet, as I told you,--
Dialogue#FROTH=All this is true.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Why, very well, then,--
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
Dialogue#ESCALUS=was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
Dialogue#ESCALUS=complain of? Come me to what was done to her.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=No, sir, nor I mean it not.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
Dialogue#POMPEY=leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
Dialogue#POMPEY=here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose
Dialogue#POMPEY=father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,
Dialogue#POMPEY=Master Froth?
Dialogue#FROTH=All-hallond eve.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
Dialogue#POMPEY=sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in
Dialogue#POMPEY=the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight
Dialogue#POMPEY=to sit, have you not?
Dialogue#FROTH=I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.
Dialogue#ANGELO=This will last out a night in Russia,
Dialogue#ANGELO=When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
Dialogue#ANGELO=And leave you to the hearing of the cause;

Dialogue#ESCALUS=I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
Notice#Exit ANGELO
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?
Dialogue#POMPEY=Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.
Dialogue#ELBOW=I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
Dialogue#POMPEY=I beseech your honour, ask me.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?
Dialogue#POMPEY=I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a
Dialogue#POMPEY=good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Ay, sir, very well.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Well, I do so.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Why, no.
Dialogue#POMPEY=I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
Dialogue#POMPEY=thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the
Dialogue#POMPEY=worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the
Dialogue#POMPEY=constable's wife any harm? I would know that of
Dialogue#POMPEY=your honour.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?
Dialogue#ELBOW=First, an it like you, the house is a respected
Dialogue#ELBOW=house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
Dialogue#ELBOW=mistress is a respected woman.
Dialogue#POMPEY=By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
Dialogue#POMPEY=person than any of us all.
Dialogue#ELBOW=Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
Dialogue#ELBOW=time has yet to come that she was ever respected
Dialogue#ELBOW=with man, woman, or child.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
Dialogue#ESCALUS=this true?
Dialogue#ELBOW=O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
Dialogue#ELBOW=Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
Dialogue#ELBOW=to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
Dialogue#ELBOW=with me, let not your worship think me the poor
Dialogue#ELBOW=duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
Dialogue#ELBOW=I'll have mine action of battery on thee.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
Dialogue#ESCALUS=action of slander too.
Dialogue#ELBOW=Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't
Dialogue#ELBOW=your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
Dialogue#ESCALUS=that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
Dialogue#ESCALUS=continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
Dialogue#ESCALUS=are.
Dialogue#ELBOW=Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
Dialogue#ELBOW=wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art
Dialogue#ELBOW=to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Where were you born, friend?
Dialogue#FROTH=Here in Vienna, sir.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
Dialogue#FROTH=Yes, an't please you, sir.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=So. What trade are you of, sir?
Dialogue#POMPHEY=Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Your mistress' name?
Dialogue#POMPHEY=Mistress Overdone.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Hath she had any more than one husband?
Dialogue#POMPEY=Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
Dialogue#ESCALUS=tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
Dialogue#ESCALUS=will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
Dialogue#ESCALUS=more of you.
Dialogue#FROTH=I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never
Dialogue#FROTH=come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
Dialogue#FROTH=in.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
Notice#Exit FROTH
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your
Dialogue#ESCALUS=name, Master tapster?
Dialogue#POMPEY=Pompey.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=What else?
Dialogue#POMPEY=Bum, sir.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;
Dialogue#ESCALUS=so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
Dialogue#ESCALUS=howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you
Dialogue#ESCALUS=not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
Dialogue#ESCALUS=do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?
Dialogue#POMPEY=If the law would allow it, sir.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
Dialogue#ESCALUS=not be allowed in Vienna.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the
Dialogue#POMPEY=youth of the city?
Dialogue#ESCALUS=No, Pompey.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
Dialogue#POMPEY=If your worship will take order for the drabs and
Dialogue#POMPEY=the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:
Dialogue#ESCALUS=it is but heading and hanging.
Dialogue#POMPEY=If you head and hang all that offend that way but
Dialogue#POMPEY=for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a
Dialogue#POMPEY=commission for more heads: if this law hold in
Dialogue#POMPEY=Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it
Dialogue#POMPEY=after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this
Dialogue#POMPEY=come to pass, say Pompey told you so.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
Dialogue#ESCALUS=prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find
Dialogue#ESCALUS=you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;
Dialogue#ESCALUS=no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
Dialogue#ESCALUS=I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
Dialogue#ESCALUS=have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.
Dialogue#POMPEY=I thank your worship for your good counsel:
Notice#Aside
Dialogue#POMPEY=but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall

Dialogue#ESCALUS=continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?
Dialogue#ELBOW=And a half, sir.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
Dialogue#ESCALUS=wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men
Dialogue#ESCALUS=in your ward sufficient to serve it?
Dialogue#ELBOW=Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they
Dialogue#ELBOW=are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I
Dialogue#ELBOW=do it for some piece of money, and go through with
Dialogue#ELBOW=all.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,

Dialogue#ANGELO=Well; what's your suit?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=There is a vice that most I do abhor,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
Dialogue#ISABELLA=For which I would not plead, but that I must;

Dialogue#ANGELO=Well; the matter?

Dialogue#ISABELLA=And not my brother.
Dialogue#Provost=[Aside]  Heaven give thee moving graces!

Dialogue#LUCIO=Ay, touch him; there's the vein.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
Dialogue#ANGELO=And you but waste your words.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Alas, alas!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;

Dialogue#ISABELLA=Like man new made.
Dialogue#ANGELO=                  Be you content, fair maid;

Dialogue#ANGELO=It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
Dialogue#ISABELLA=We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
Dialogue#ISABELLA=With less respect than we do minister
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Who is it that hath died for this offence?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=There's many have committed it.
Dialogue#LUCIO=[Aside to ISABELLA]           Ay, well said.
Dialogue#ANGELO=The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:

Dialogue#ANGELO=Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
Dialogue#ANGELO=And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Are now to have no successive degrees,
Dialogue#ANGELO=But, ere they live, to end.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Yet show some pity.
Dialogue#ANGELO=I show it most of all when I show justice;
Dialogue#ANGELO=For then I pity those I do not know,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
Dialogue#ANGELO=And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
Dialogue#ANGELO=Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To use it like a giant.
Dialogue#LUCIO=[Aside to ISABELLA]   That's well said.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Could great men thunder
Dialogue#ISABELLA=As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=For every pelting, petty officer

Dialogue#ISABELLA=Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Drest in a little brief authority,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
Dialogue#ISABELLA=As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Would all themselves laugh mortal.
Dialogue#LUCIO=[Aside to ISABELLA]  O, to him, to him, wench! he
Dialogue#LUCIO=will relent;
Dialogue#LUCIO=He's coming; I perceive 't.
Dialogue#Provost=[Aside]  Pray heaven she win him!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=But in the less foul profanation.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That in the captain's but a choleric word,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.
Dialogue#LUCIO=[Aside to ISABELLA]  Art avised o' that? more on 't.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Why do you put these sayings upon me?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Because authority, though it err like others,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
Dialogue#ISABELLA=A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Against my brother's life.
Dialogue#ANGELO=[Aside]                  She speaks, and 'tis
Dialogue#ANGELO=Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Gentle my lord, turn back.
Dialogue#ANGELO=I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.
Dialogue#ANGELO=How! bribe me?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
Dialogue#LUCIO=[Aside to ISABELLA]  You had marr'd all else.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
Dialogue#ISABELLA=As fancy values them; but with true prayers
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To nothing temporal.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Well; come to me to-morrow.
Dialogue#LUCIO=[Aside to ISABELLA]  Go to; 'tis well; away!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Heaven keep your honour safe!
Dialogue#ANGELO=[Aside]	Amen:

Dialogue#ANGELO=The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Dialogue#ANGELO=Ha!
Dialogue#ANGELO=Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
Dialogue#ANGELO=That, lying by the violet in the sun,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
Dialogue#ANGELO=That modesty may more betray our sense
Dialogue#ANGELO=Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
Dialogue#ANGELO=And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
Dialogue#ANGELO=What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
Dialogue#ANGELO=Dost thou desire her foully for those things
Dialogue#ANGELO=That make her good? O, let her brother live!
Dialogue#ANGELO=Thieves for their robbery have authority
Dialogue#ANGELO=When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
Dialogue#ANGELO=That I desire to hear her speak again,
Dialogue#ANGELO=And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
Dialogue#ANGELO=O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
Dialogue#ANGELO=With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
Dialogue#ANGELO=Is that temptation that doth goad us on
Dialogue#ANGELO=To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
Dialogue#ANGELO=With all her double vigour, art and nature,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
Dialogue#ANGELO=Subdues me quite. Even till now,
Dialogue#ANGELO=When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.

Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Bound by my charity and my blest order,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Here in the prison. Do me the common right
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To let me see them and to make me know

Dialogue#Provost=Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,

Dialogue#Provost=Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;

Dialogue#Provost=More fit to do another such offence
Dialogue#Provost=Than die for this.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=When must he die?
Dialogue#Provost=                  As I do think, to-morrow.
Dialogue#Provost=I have provided for you: stay awhile,
Notice#To JULIET
Dialogue#Provost=And you shall be conducted.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
Dialogue#JULIET=I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And try your penitence, if it be sound,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Or hollowly put on.
Dialogue#JULIET=I'll gladly learn.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Love you the man that wrong'd you?
Dialogue#JULIET=Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=So then it seems your most offenceful act
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Was mutually committed?
Dialogue#JULIET=Mutually.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
Dialogue#JULIET=I do confess it, and repent it, father.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO='Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,

Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=But as we stand in fear,--
Dialogue#JULIET=I do repent me, as it is an evil,
Dialogue#JULIET=And take the shame with joy.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=There rest.

Dialogue#ANGELO=Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
Dialogue#ANGELO=As if I did but only chew his name;
Dialogue#ANGELO=And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
Dialogue#ANGELO=Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
Dialogue#ANGELO=Is like a good thing, being often read,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
Dialogue#ANGELO=How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
Dialogue#ANGELO=To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:

Dialogue#ANGELO=Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Making both it unable for itself,

Dialogue#ANGELO=So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;

Dialogue#ANGELO=How now, fair maid?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I am come to know your pleasure.
Dialogue#ANGELO=That you might know it, would much better please me

Dialogue#ISABELLA=Even so. Heaven keep your honour!
Dialogue#ANGELO=Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
Dialogue#As long as you or I=yet he must die.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Under your sentence?
Dialogue#ANGELO=Yea.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That his soul sicken not.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
Dialogue#ANGELO=To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
Dialogue#ANGELO=A man already made, as to remit
Dialogue#ANGELO=Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
Dialogue#ANGELO=In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
Dialogue#ANGELO=Falsely to take away a life true made
Dialogue#ANGELO=As to put metal in restrained means
Dialogue#ANGELO=To make a false one.
Dialogue#ISABELLA='Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Which had you rather, that the most just law
Dialogue#ANGELO=Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
Dialogue#ANGELO=As she that he hath stain'd?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Sir, believe this,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I had rather give my body than my soul.
Dialogue#ANGELO=I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
Dialogue#ANGELO=Stand more for number than for accompt.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=How say you?
Dialogue#ANGELO=Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
Dialogue#ANGELO=Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
Dialogue#ANGELO=I, now the voice of the recorded law,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
Dialogue#ANGELO=Might there not be a charity in sin
Dialogue#ANGELO=To save this brother's life?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Please you to do't,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=It is no sin at all, but charity.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Were equal poise of sin and charity.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To have it added to the faults of mine,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And nothing of your answer.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Nay, but hear me.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=But graciously to know I am no better.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
Dialogue#ANGELO=When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
Dialogue#ANGELO=Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
Dialogue#ANGELO=Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
Dialogue#ANGELO=To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
Dialogue#ANGELO=Your brother is to die.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=So.
Dialogue#ANGELO=And his offence is so, as it appears,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Accountant to the law upon that pain.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=True.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Admit no other way to save his life,--
Dialogue#ANGELO=As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
Dialogue#ANGELO=But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Finding yourself desired of such a person,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Dialogue#ANGELO=Of the all-building law; and that there were
Dialogue#ANGELO=No earthly mean to save him, but that either
Dialogue#ANGELO=You must lay down the treasures of your body
Dialogue#ANGELO=To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
Dialogue#ANGELO=What would you do?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=As much for my poor brother as myself:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That is, were I under the terms of death,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And strip myself to death, as to a bed
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
Dialogue#ISABELLA=My body up to shame.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Then must your brother die.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And 'twere the cheaper way:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Better it were a brother died at once,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Should die for ever.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
Dialogue#ANGELO=That you have slander'd so?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
Dialogue#ANGELO=You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
Dialogue#ANGELO=And rather proved the sliding of your brother
Dialogue#ANGELO=A merriment than a vice.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I something do excuse the thing I hate,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=For his advantage that I dearly love.
Dialogue#ANGELO=We are all frail.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=                  Else let my brother die,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=If not a feodary, but only he
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Owe and succeed thy weakness.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Nay, women are frail too.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
Dialogue#ISABELLA=In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
Dialogue#ISABELLA=For we are soft as our complexions are,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And credulous to false prints.
Dialogue#ANGELO=I think it well:
Dialogue#ANGELO=And from this testimony of your own sex,--
Dialogue#ANGELO=Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Dialogue#ANGELO=Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;
Dialogue#ANGELO=I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
Dialogue#ANGELO=That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
Dialogue#ANGELO=If you be one, as you are well express'd
Dialogue#ANGELO=By all external warrants, show it now,
Dialogue#ANGELO=By putting on the destined livery.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Let me entreat you speak the former language.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Plainly conceive, I love you.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=My brother did love Juliet,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And you tell me that he shall die for it.
Dialogue#ANGELO=He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Which seems a little fouler than it is,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To pluck on others.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Believe me, on mine honour,
Dialogue#ANGELO=My words express my purpose.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Ha! little honour to be much believed,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
Dialogue#ISABELLA=What man thou art.
Dialogue#ANGELO=                  Who will believe thee, Isabel?
Dialogue#ANGELO=My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
Dialogue#ANGELO=My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Will so your accusation overweigh,
Dialogue#ANGELO=That you shall stifle in your own report
Dialogue#ANGELO=And smell of calumny. I have begun,
Dialogue#ANGELO=And now I give my sensual race the rein:
Dialogue#ANGELO=Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
Dialogue#ANGELO=Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
Dialogue#ANGELO=That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
Dialogue#ANGELO=By yielding up thy body to my will;
Dialogue#ANGELO=Or else he must not only die the death,
Dialogue#ANGELO=But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
Dialogue#ANGELO=To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
Dialogue#ANGELO=I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.

Dialogue#ISABELLA=Either of condemnation or approof;
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That, had he twenty heads to tender down
Dialogue#ISABELLA=On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Before his sister should her body stoop
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To such abhorr'd pollution.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=More than our brother is our chastity.

Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=The miserable have no other medicine
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=But only hope:
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Be absolute for death; either death or life
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Servile to all the skyey influences,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,

Dialogue#ISABELLA=Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To-morrow you set on.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Is there no remedy?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To cleave a heart in twain.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=But is there any?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Yes, brother, you may live:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=But fetter you till death.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Perpetual durance?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Though all the world's vastidity you had,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To a determined scope.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=But in what nature?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=In such a one as, you consenting to't,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And leave you naked.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Let me know the point.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And six or seven winters more respect
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=The sense of death is most in apprehension;
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
Dialogue#ISABELLA=As when a giant dies.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Why give you me this shame?
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Think you I can a resolution fetch
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=I will encounter darkness as a bride,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=And hug it in mine arms.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=There spake my brother; there my father's grave
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Thou art too noble to conserve a life
Dialogue#ISABELLA=In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
Dialogue#ISABELLA=As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
Dialogue#ISABELLA=His filth within being cast, he would appear

Dialogue#CLAUDIO=The prenzie Angelo!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=The damned'st body to invest and cover
Dialogue#ISABELLA=In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=If I would yield him my virginity,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Thou mightst be freed.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=O heavens! it cannot be.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=So to offend him still. This night's the time
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That I should do what I abhor to name,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Or else thou diest to-morrow.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Thou shalt not do't.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=O, were it but my life,

Dialogue#ISABELLA=As frankly as a pin.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Thanks, dear Isabel.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Yes. Has he affections in him,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Which is the least?
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=If it were damnable, he being so wise,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Why would he for the momentary trick
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=What says my brother?
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Death is a fearful thing.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And shamed life a hateful.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=This sensible warm motion to become
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=And blown with restless violence round about
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Of those that lawless and incertain thought
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=The weariest and most loathed worldly life
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Can lay on nature is a paradise
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=To what we fear of death.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Alas, alas!
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=          Sweet sister, let me live:
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=What sin you do to save a brother's life,
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Nature dispenses with the deed so far
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=That it becomes a virtue.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=O you beast!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
Dialogue#ISABELLA=From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=For such a warped slip of wilderness
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Die, perish! Might but my bending down
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=No word to save thee.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Nay, hear me, Isabel.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=O, fie, fie, fie!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.

Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=your knees and make ready.
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=with life that I will sue to be rid of it.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Hold you there: farewell.
Notice#Exit CLAUDIO
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Provost, a word with you!
Notice#Re-enter Provost
Dialogue#Provost=What's your will, father
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=habit no loss shall touch her by my company.
Dialogue#Provost=In good time.
Notice#Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=substitute, and to save your brother?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
Dialogue#ISABELLA=brother die by the law than my son should be
Dialogue#ISABELLA=unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
Dialogue#ISABELLA=deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
Dialogue#ISABELLA=speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
Dialogue#ISABELLA=discover his government.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=person; and much please the absent duke, if
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=this business.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
Dialogue#ISABELLA=anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=which time of the contract and limit of the
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=is washed with them, but relents not.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
Dialogue#ISABELLA=from the world! What corruption in this life, that
Dialogue#ISABELLA=it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=you from dishonour in doing it.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Show me how, good father.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=like an impediment in the current, made it more
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=This being granted in course,--and now follows
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=What think you of it?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=The image of it gives me content already; and I
Dialogue#ISABELLA=trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=it may be quickly.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.

Notice#Enter, on one side, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before; on the other, ELBOW, and Officers with POMPEY
Dialogue#ELBOW=Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will
Dialogue#ELBOW=needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
Dialogue#ELBOW=shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=O heavens! what stuff is here
Dialogue#POMPEY='Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the
Dialogue#POMPEY=merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by
Dialogue#POMPEY=order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and
Dialogue#POMPEY=furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that
Dialogue#POMPEY=craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.
Dialogue#ELBOW=Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And you, good brother father. What offence hath
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=this man made you, sir?
Dialogue#ELBOW=Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we
Dialogue#ELBOW=take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found
Dialogue#ELBOW=upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
Dialogue#ELBOW=sent to the deputy.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=The evil that thou causest to be done,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=From their abominable and beastly touches
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,
Dialogue#POMPEY=sir, I would prove--
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Correction and instruction must both work
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Ere this rude beast will profit.
Dialogue#ELBOW=He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him
Dialogue#ELBOW=warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if
Dialogue#ELBOW=he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were
Dialogue#ELBOW=as good go a mile on his errand.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That we were all, as some would seem to be,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!
Dialogue#ELBOW=His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.
Dialogue#POMPEY=I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a
Dialogue#POMPEY=friend of mine.
Notice#Enter LUCIO
Dialogue#LUCIO=How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
Dialogue#LUCIO=Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
Dialogue#LUCIO=none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
Dialogue#LUCIO=had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and
Dialogue#LUCIO=extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
Dialogue#LUCIO=sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
Dialogue#LUCIO=not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest
Dialogue#LUCIO=thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
Dialogue#LUCIO=the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
Dialogue#LUCIO=trick of it?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Still thus, and thus; still worse!
Dialogue#LUCIO=How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she
Dialogue#LUCIO=still, ha?
Dialogue#POMPEY=Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she
Dialogue#POMPEY=is herself in the tub.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be
Dialogue#LUCIO=so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:
Dialogue#LUCIO=an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going
Dialogue#LUCIO=to prison, Pompey?
Dialogue#POMPEY=Yes, faith, sir.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
Dialogue#LUCIO=sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?
Dialogue#ELBOW=For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the
Dialogue#LUCIO=due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
Dialogue#LUCIO=doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
Dialogue#LUCIO=Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
Dialogue#LUCIO=will keep the house.
Dialogue#POMPEY=I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.
Dialogue#LUCIO=No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
Dialogue#LUCIO=I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
Dialogue#LUCIO=you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
Dialogue#LUCIO=more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And you.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?
Dialogue#ELBOW=Come your ways, sir; come.
Dialogue#POMPEY=You will not bail me, then, sir?
Dialogue#LUCIO=Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
Dialogue#LUCIO=what news?
Dialogue#ELBOW=Come your ways, sir; come.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
Notice#Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers
Dialogue#LUCIO=What news, friar, of the duke?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I know none. Can you tell me of any?
Dialogue#LUCIO=Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
Dialogue#LUCIO=some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
Dialogue#LUCIO=It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
Dialogue#LUCIO=the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
Dialogue#LUCIO=to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
Dialogue#LUCIO=puts transgression to 't.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=He does well in 't.
Dialogue#LUCIO=A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
Dialogue#LUCIO=him: something too crabbed that way, friar.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
Dialogue#LUCIO=it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp
Dialogue#LUCIO=it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put
Dialogue#LUCIO=down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
Dialogue#LUCIO=woman after this downright way of creation: is it
Dialogue#LUCIO=true, think you?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=How should he be made, then?
Dialogue#LUCIO=Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
Dialogue#LUCIO=was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
Dialogue#LUCIO=certain that when he makes water his urine is
Dialogue#LUCIO=congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a
Dialogue#LUCIO=motion generative; that's infallible.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
Dialogue#LUCIO=rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
Dialogue#LUCIO=man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
Dialogue#LUCIO=Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
Dialogue#LUCIO=hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing
Dialogue#LUCIO=a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
Dialogue#LUCIO=knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I never heard the absent duke much detected for
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=women; he was not inclined that way.
Dialogue#LUCIO=O, sir, you are deceived.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO='Tis not possible.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
Dialogue#LUCIO=his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the
Dialogue#LUCIO=duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;
Dialogue#LUCIO=that let me inform you.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=You do him wrong, surely.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
Dialogue#LUCIO=duke: and I believe I know the cause of his
Dialogue#LUCIO=withdrawing.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=What, I prithee, might be the cause?
Dialogue#LUCIO=No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
Dialogue#LUCIO=teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
Dialogue#LUCIO=understand, the greater file of the subject held the
Dialogue#LUCIO=duke to be wise.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Wise! why, no question but he was.
Dialogue#LUCIO=A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=the very stream of his life and the business he hath
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Sir, I know him, and I love him.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=dearer love.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Come, sir, I know what I know.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=upon you; and, I pray you, your name?
Dialogue#LUCIO=Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=report you.
Dialogue#LUCIO=I fear you not.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.
Dialogue#LUCIO=I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
Dialogue#LUCIO=friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
Dialogue#LUCIO=Claudio die to-morrow or no?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Why should he die, sir?
Dialogue#LUCIO=Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
Dialogue#LUCIO=the duke we talk of were returned again: the
Dialogue#LUCIO=ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
Dialogue#LUCIO=continency; sparrows must not build in his
Dialogue#LUCIO=house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke
Dialogue#LUCIO=yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would
Dialogue#LUCIO=never bring them to light: would he were returned!
Dialogue#LUCIO=Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
Dialogue#LUCIO=duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
Dialogue#LUCIO=Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
Dialogue#LUCIO=he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown
Dialogue#LUCIO=bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=No might nor greatness in mortality
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=But who comes here?
Notice#Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Go; away with her to prison!
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=a merciful man; good my lord.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
Dialogue#ESCALUS=the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
Dialogue#ESCALUS=the tyrant.
Dialogue#Provost=A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please
Dialogue#Provost=your honour.
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:
Dialogue#MISTRESS OVERDONE=I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!
Dialogue#ESCALUS=That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
Dialogue#ESCALUS=called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;
Dialogue#ESCALUS=no more words.
Notice#Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
Dialogue#ESCALUS=with divines, and have all charitable preparation.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be
Dialogue#ESCALUS=so with him.
Dialogue#Provost=So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
Dialogue#Provost=advised him for the entertainment of death.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Good even, good father.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Bliss and goodness on you!
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Of whence are you?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Not of this country, though my chance is now
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To use it for my time: I am a brother
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Of gracious order, late come from the See
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=In special business from his holiness.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=What news abroad i' the world?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=None, but that there is so great a fever on
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?
Dialogue#ESCALUS=One that, above all other strifes, contended
Dialogue#ESCALUS=especially to know himself.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=What pleasure was he given to?
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
Dialogue#ESCALUS=any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a
Dialogue#ESCALUS=gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
Dialogue#ESCALUS=his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;
Dialogue#ESCALUS=and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
Dialogue#ESCALUS=prepared. I am made to understand that you have
Dialogue#ESCALUS=lent him visitation.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=He professes to have received no sinister measure
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=resolved to die.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=You have paid the heavens your function, and the
Dialogue#ESCALUS=prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
Dialogue#ESCALUS=laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
Dialogue#ESCALUS=shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
Dialogue#ESCALUS=found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
Dialogue#ESCALUS=he is indeed Justice.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=If his own life answer the straitness of his
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Peace be with you!
Notice#Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost

Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=More nor less to others paying
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Than by self-offences weighing.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Shame to him whose cruel striking
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Kills for faults of his own liking!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Twice treble shame on Angelo,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To weed my vice and let his grow!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=O, what may man within him hide,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Though angel on the outward side!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=How may likeness made in crimes,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Making practise on the times,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To draw with idle spiders' strings
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Most ponderous and substantial things!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Craft against vice I must apply:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=With Angelo to-night shall lie
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=His old betrothed but despised;

Dialogue#ISABELLA=No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;

Dialogue#ISABELLA=Can be but brief; for I have made him know
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I have a servant comes with me along,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I come about my brother.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO='Tis well borne up.

Dialogue#ISABELLA=I do desire the like.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?
Dialogue#MARIANA=Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Who hath a story ready for your ear.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;

Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit

Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And rack thee in their fancies.

Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Welcome, how agreed?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=If you advise it.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=                  It is not my consent,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=But my entreaty too.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Little have you to say
Dialogue#ISABELLA=When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
Dialogue#ISABELLA='Remember now my brother.'
Dialogue#MARIANA=Fear me not.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=He is your husband on a pre-contract:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Sith that the justice of your title to him
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:

Notice#Enter Provost and POMPEY
Dialogue#Provost=Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?
Dialogue#POMPEY=If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
Dialogue#POMPEY=married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never
Dialogue#POMPEY=cut off a woman's head.
Dialogue#Provost=Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a
Dialogue#Provost=direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
Dialogue#Provost=and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
Dialogue#Provost=executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if
Dialogue#Provost=you will take it on you to assist him, it shall
Dialogue#Provost=redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have
Dialogue#Provost=your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
Dialogue#Provost=with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a
Dialogue#Provost=notorious bawd.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
Dialogue#POMPEY=but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I
Dialogue#POMPEY=would be glad to receive some instruction from my
Dialogue#POMPEY=fellow partner.
Dialogue#Provost=What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?
Notice#Enter ABHORSON
Dialogue#ABHORSON=Do you call, sir?
Dialogue#Provost=Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in
Dialogue#Provost=your execution. If you think it meet, compound with
Dialogue#Provost=him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if
Dialogue#Provost=not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He
Dialogue#Provost=cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.
Dialogue#ABHORSON=A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.
Dialogue#Provost=Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn
Dialogue#Provost=the scale.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#POMPEY=Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a
Dialogue#POMPEY=good favour you have, but that you have a hanging
Dialogue#POMPEY=look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?
Dialogue#ABHORSON=Ay, sir; a mystery
Dialogue#POMPEY=Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and
Dialogue#POMPEY=your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
Dialogue#POMPEY=using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:
Dialogue#POMPEY=but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I
Dialogue#POMPEY=should be hanged, I cannot imagine.
Dialogue#ABHORSON=Sir, it is a mystery.
Dialogue#POMPEY=Proof?
Dialogue#ABHORSON=Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
Dialogue#ABHORSON=too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
Dialogue#ABHORSON=big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your
Dialogue#ABHORSON=thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's
Dialogue#ABHORSON=apparel fits your thief.
Notice#Re-enter Provost
Dialogue#Provost=Are you agreed?
Dialogue#POMPEY=Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is
Dialogue#POMPEY=a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth
Dialogue#POMPEY=oftener ask forgiveness.
Dialogue#Provost=You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
Dialogue#Provost=to-morrow four o'clock.
Dialogue#ABHORSON=Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.
Dialogue#POMPEY=I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have
Dialogue#POMPEY=occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find
Dialogue#POMPEY=me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you
Dialogue#POMPEY=a good turn.
Dialogue#Provost=Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:
Notice#Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSON
Dialogue#Provost=The one has my pity; not a jot the other,

Notice#Enter CLAUDIO
Dialogue#Provost=Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
Dialogue#Provost='Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
Dialogue#Provost=Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
Dialogue#CLAUDIO=He will not wake.
Dialogue#Provost=                  Who can do good on him?
Dialogue#Provost=Well, go, prepare yourself.
Notice#Knocking within
Dialogue#Provost=But, hark, what noise?
Dialogue#Provost=Heaven give your spirits comfort!

Dialogue#Provost=None, since the curfew rung.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Not Isabel?
Dialogue#Provost=          No.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=                  They will, then, ere't be long.
Dialogue#Provost=What comfort is for Claudio?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=There's some in hope.
Dialogue#Provost=It is a bitter deputy.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=He doth with holy abstinence subdue
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That in himself which he spurs on his power
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=But this being so, he's just.
Notice#Knocking within
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Now are they come.

Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=This is a gentle provost: seldom when

Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.
Notice#Re-enter Provost
Dialogue#Provost=There he must stay until the officer
Dialogue#Provost=Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=But he must die to-morrow?
Dialogue#Provost=None, sir, none.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=You shall hear more ere morning.
Dialogue#Provost=Happily
Dialogue#Provost=You something know; yet I believe there comes
Dialogue#Provost=No countermand; no such example have we:
Dialogue#Provost=Besides, upon the very siege of justice
Dialogue#Provost=Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Dialogue#Provost=Profess'd the contrary.
Notice#Enter a Messenger
Dialogue#Provost=This is his lordship's man.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And here comes Claudio's pardon.
Dialogue#Messenger=[Giving a paper]
Dialogue#Messenger=My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this
Dialogue#Messenger=further charge, that you swerve not from the
Dialogue#Messenger=smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or
Dialogue#Messenger=other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,
Dialogue#Messenger=it is almost day.
Dialogue#Provost=I shall obey him.
Notice#Exit Messenger
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=[Aside]  This is his pardon, purchased by such sin
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For which the pardoner himself is in.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=When it is born in high authority:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That for the fault's love is the offender friended.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Now, sir, what news?
Dialogue#Provost=I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
Dialogue#Provost=in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
Dialogue#Provost=putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Pray you, let's hear.
Dialogue#Provost=[Reads]
Dialogue#Provost='Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let
Dialogue#Provost=Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and in the
Dialogue#Provost=afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,
Dialogue#Provost=let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Let
Dialogue#Provost=this be duly performed; with a thought that more
Dialogue#Provost=depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail
Dialogue#Provost=not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'
Dialogue#Provost=What say you to this, sir?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=afternoon?
Dialogue#Provost=A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
Dialogue#Provost=that is a prisoner nine years old.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=How came it that the absent duke had not either
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=have heard it was ever his manner to do so.
Dialogue#Provost=His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
Dialogue#Provost=indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
Dialogue#Provost=Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=It is now apparent?
Dialogue#Provost=Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=seems he to be touched?
Dialogue#Provost=A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
Dialogue#Provost=as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
Dialogue#Provost=of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
Dialogue#Provost=mortality, and desperately mortal.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=He wants advice.
Dialogue#Provost=He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
Dialogue#Provost=of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he
Dialogue#Provost=would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days
Dialogue#Provost=entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
Dialogue#Provost=to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming
Dialogue#Provost=warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=for the which you are to do me both a present and a
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=dangerous courtesy.
Dialogue#Provost=Pray, sir, in what?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=In the delaying death.
Dialogue#Provost=A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
Dialogue#Provost=and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
Dialogue#Provost=his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case
Dialogue#Provost=as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.
Dialogue#Provost=Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=death: you know the course is common. If any thing
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=against it with my life.
Dialogue#Provost=Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?
Dialogue#Provost=To him, and to his substitutes.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=avouch the justice of your dealing?
Dialogue#Provost=But what likelihood is in that?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=signet is not strange to you.
Dialogue#Provost=I know them both.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=shall find, within these two days he will be here.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=very day receives letters of strange tenor;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=things should be: all difficulties are but easy
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=when they are known. Call your executioner, and off
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

Dialogue#POMPEY=customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in
Dialogue#POMPEY=for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
Dialogue#POMPEY=ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made
Dialogue#POMPEY=five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not

Dialogue#BARNARDINE=You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not

Dialogue#Provost=                  Here in the prison, father,
Dialogue#Provost=There died this morning of a cruel fever
Dialogue#Provost=One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
Dialogue#Provost=A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head

Dialogue#LUCIO=Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:
Dialogue#LUCIO=he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee
Dialogue#LUCIO=I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=they be true; if not true, none were enough.
Dialogue#LUCIO=I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Did you such a thing?
Dialogue#LUCIO=Yes, marry, did I	but I was fain to forswear it;
Dialogue#LUCIO=they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.
Dialogue#LUCIO=By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
Dialogue#LUCIO=if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of
Dialogue#LUCIO=it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.

Dialogue#ESCALUS=Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.
Dialogue#ANGELO=In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
Dialogue#ANGELO=show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
Dialogue#ANGELO=not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and
Dialogue#ANGELO=redeliver our authorities there
Dialogue#ESCALUS=I guess not.
Dialogue#ANGELO=And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
Dialogue#ANGELO=entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,
Dialogue#ANGELO=they should exhibit their petitions in the street?
Dialogue#ESCALUS=He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
Dialogue#ESCALUS=complaints, and to deliver us from devices
Dialogue#ESCALUS=hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand
Dialogue#ESCALUS=against us.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
Dialogue#ANGELO=i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
Dialogue#ANGELO=notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
Dialogue#ANGELO=him.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=I shall, sir. Fare you well.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Good night.

Dialogue#ANGELO=The law against it! But that her tender shame
Dialogue#ANGELO=Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
Dialogue#ANGELO=How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
Dialogue#ANGELO=For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
Dialogue#ANGELO=That no particular scandal once can touch
Dialogue#ANGELO=But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
Dialogue#ANGELO=By so receiving a dishonour'd life
Dialogue#ANGELO=With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!

Dialogue#ISABELLA=He says, to veil full purpose.
Dialogue#MARIANA=Be ruled by him.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
Dialogue#ISABELLA=He speak against me on the adverse side,

Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Happy return be to your royal grace!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Many and hearty thankings to you both.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Forerunning more requital.
Dialogue#ANGELO=You make my bonds still greater.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=When it deserves, with characters of brass,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And let the subject see, to make them know
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=You must walk by us on our other hand;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And good supporters are you.
Notice#FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
Dialogue#ISABELLA=By throwing it on any other object
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Till you have heard me in my true complaint
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Reveal yourself to him.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=O worthy duke,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Must either punish me, not being believed,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!
Dialogue#ANGELO=My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
Dialogue#ANGELO=She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
Dialogue#ANGELO=Cut off by course of justice,--
Dialogue#ISABELLA=By course of justice!
Dialogue#ANGELO=And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Is it not strange and strange?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Nay, it is ten times strange.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=It is not truer he is Angelo
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Than this is all as true as it is strange:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To the end of reckoning.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Away with her! Poor soul,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
Dialogue#ISABELLA=There is another comfort than this world,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
Dialogue#ISABELLA=But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
Dialogue#ISABELLA=As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Had I more name for badness.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=By mine honesty,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Such a dependency of thing on thing,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=As e'er I heard in madness.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=O gracious duke,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
Dialogue#ISABELLA=For inequality; but let your reason serve
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And hide the false seems true.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Many that are not mad
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I am the sister of one Claudio,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I, in probation of a sisterhood,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
Dialogue#ISABELLA=As then the messenger,--
Dialogue#LUCIO=That's I, an't like your grace:
Dialogue#LUCIO=I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
Dialogue#LUCIO=To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
Dialogue#LUCIO=For her poor brother's pardon.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That's he indeed.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=You were not bid to speak.
Dialogue#LUCIO=No, my good lord;
Dialogue#LUCIO=Nor wish'd to hold my peace.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I wish you now, then;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Be perfect.
Dialogue#LUCIO=I warrant your honour.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--
Dialogue#LUCIO=Right.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To speak before your time. Proceed.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I went
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That's somewhat madly spoken.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Pardon it;
Dialogue#ISABELLA=The phrase is to the matter.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Mended again. The matter; proceed.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=In brief, to set the needless process by,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
Dialogue#ISABELLA=For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
Dialogue#ISABELLA=To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
Dialogue#ISABELLA=For my poor brother's head.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=This is most likely!
Dialogue#ISABELLA=O, that it were as like as it is true!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=In hateful practise. First, his integrity
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That with such vehemency he should pursue
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Thou camest here to complain.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And is this all?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Then, O you blessed ministers above,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
Dialogue#ISABELLA=In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?
Dialogue#ISABELLA=One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?
Dialogue#LUCIO=My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
Dialogue#LUCIO=I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord
Dialogue#LUCIO=For certain words he spake against your grace
Dialogue#LUCIO=In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And to set on this wretched woman here
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.
Dialogue#LUCIO=But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
Dialogue#LUCIO=I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
Dialogue#LUCIO=A very scurvy fellow.
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Blessed be your royal grace!
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Who is as free from touch or soil with her
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=As she from one ungot.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=We did believe no less.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=I know him for a man divine and holy;
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=As he's reported by this gentleman;
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=And, on my trust, a man that never yet
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.
Dialogue#LUCIO=My lord, most villanously; believe it.
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=But at this instant he is sick my lord,
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Is true and false; and what he with his oath
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=And all probation will make up full clear,
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=To justify this worthy nobleman,
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=So vulgarly and personally accused,
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Till she herself confess it.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Good friar, let's hear it.
Notice#ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=First, let her show her face, and after speak.
Dialogue#MARIANA=Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
Dialogue#MARIANA=Until my husband bid me.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=What, are you married?
Dialogue#MARIANA=No, my lord.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Are you a maid?
Dialogue#MARIANA=No, my lord.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=A widow, then?
Dialogue#MARIANA=Neither, my lord.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?
Dialogue#LUCIO=My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are
Dialogue#LUCIO=neither maid, widow, nor wife.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To prattle for himself.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Well, my lord.
Dialogue#MARIANA=My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;
Dialogue#MARIANA=And I confess besides I am no maid:
Dialogue#MARIANA=I have known my husband; yet my husband
Dialogue#MARIANA=Knows not that ever he knew me.
Dialogue#LUCIO=He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!
Dialogue#LUCIO=Well, my lord.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
Dialogue#MARIANA=Now I come to't my lord
Dialogue#MARIANA=She that accuses him of fornication,
Dialogue#MARIANA=In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
Dialogue#MARIANA=And charges him my lord, with such a time
Dialogue#MARIANA=When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
Dialogue#MARIANA=With all the effect of love.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Charges she more than me?
Dialogue#MARIANA=Not that I know.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=No? you say your husband.
Dialogue#MARIANA=Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
Dialogue#MARIANA=Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
Dialogue#MARIANA=But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.
Dialogue#ANGELO=This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
Dialogue#MARIANA=My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
Notice#Unveiling
Dialogue#MARIANA=This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Dialogue#MARIANA=Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
Dialogue#MARIANA=This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Dialogue#MARIANA=Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
Dialogue#MARIANA=That took away the match from Isabel,
Dialogue#MARIANA=And did supply thee at thy garden-house
Dialogue#MARIANA=In her imagined person.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Know you this woman?
Dialogue#LUCIO=Carnally, she says.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Sirrah, no more!
Dialogue#LUCIO=Enough, my lord.
Dialogue#ANGELO=My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
Dialogue#ANGELO=And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Dialogue#ANGELO=Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Partly for that her promised proportions
Dialogue#ANGELO=Came short of composition, but in chief
Dialogue#ANGELO=For that her reputation was disvalued
Dialogue#ANGELO=In levity: since which time of five years
Dialogue#ANGELO=I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Upon my faith and honour.
Dialogue#MARIANA=Noble prince,
Dialogue#MARIANA=As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
Dialogue#MARIANA=As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
Dialogue#MARIANA=I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
Dialogue#MARIANA=As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
Dialogue#MARIANA=But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
Dialogue#MARIANA=He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
Dialogue#MARIANA=Let me in safety raise me from my knees
Dialogue#MARIANA=Or else for ever be confixed here,
Dialogue#MARIANA=A marble monument!
Dialogue#ANGELO=                  I did but smile till now:
Dialogue#ANGELO=Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice
Dialogue#ANGELO=My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
Dialogue#ANGELO=These poor informal women are no more
Dialogue#ANGELO=But instruments of some more mightier member
Dialogue#ANGELO=That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
Dialogue#ANGELO=To find this practise out.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Ay, with my heart
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And punish them to your height of pleasure.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Were testimonies against his worth and credit
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=There is another friar that set them on;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Let him be sent for.
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Hath set the women on to this complaint:
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=Your provost knows the place where he abides
Dialogue#FRIAR PETER=And he may fetch him.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Go do it instantly.
Notice#Exit Provost
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Do with your injuries as seems you best,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=But stir not you till you have well determined
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Upon these slanderers.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=My lord, we'll do it throughly.
Notice#Exit DUKE
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?
Dialogue#LUCIO='Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
Dialogue#LUCIO=but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
Dialogue#LUCIO=villanous speeches of the duke.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
Dialogue#ESCALUS=enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
Dialogue#ESCALUS=notable fellow.
Dialogue#LUCIO=As any in Vienna, on my word.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.
Notice#Exit an Attendant
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you

Dialogue#LUCIO=Not better than he, by her own report.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Say you?
Dialogue#LUCIO=Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,
Dialogue#LUCIO=she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,
Dialogue#LUCIO=she'll be ashamed.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=I will go darkly to work with her.
Dialogue#LUCIO=That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
Notice#Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habit
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all
Dialogue#ESCALUS=that you have said.
Dialogue#LUCIO=My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with
Dialogue#LUCIO=the provost.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=In very good time: speak not you to him till we
Dialogue#ESCALUS=call upon you.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Mum.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO='Tis false.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=How! know you where you are?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Respect to your great place! and let the devil
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Look you speak justly.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And put your trial in the villain's mouth
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Which here you come to accuse.
Dialogue#LUCIO=This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
Dialogue#ESCALUS=To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
Dialogue#ESCALUS=And in the witness of his proper ear,
Dialogue#ESCALUS=To call him villain? and then to glance from him
Dialogue#ESCALUS=To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=What 'unjust'!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=                  Be not so hot; the duke
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Nor here provincial. My business in this state
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=As much in mock as mark.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!
Dialogue#ANGELO=What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
Dialogue#ANGELO=Is this the man that you did tell us of?
Dialogue#LUCIO='Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:
Dialogue#LUCIO=do you know me?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I

Dialogue#LUCIO=O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Most notedly, sir.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
Dialogue#LUCIO=fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=much more, much worse.
Dialogue#LUCIO=O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
Dialogue#LUCIO=nose for thy speeches?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I protest I love the duke as I love myself.
Dialogue#ANGELO=Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
Dialogue#ANGELO=treasonable abuses!
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
Dialogue#ESCALUS=him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
Dialogue#ESCALUS=to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
Dialogue#ESCALUS=speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
Dialogue#ESCALUS=with the other confederate companion!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=[To Provost]  Stay, sir; stay awhile.
Dialogue#ANGELO=What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
Dialogue#LUCIO=bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
Dialogue#LUCIO=you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!
Dialogue#LUCIO=show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
Dialogue#LUCIO=Will't not off?
Notice#Pulls off the friar's hood, and discovers DUKE VINCENTIO
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
Notice#To LUCIO
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.
Dialogue#LUCIO=This may prove worse than hanging.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=[To ESCALUS]  What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=We'll borrow place of him.
Notice#To ANGELO
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Sir, by your leave.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And hold no longer out.
Dialogue#ANGELO=O my dread lord,
Dialogue#ANGELO=I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
Dialogue#ANGELO=To think I can be undiscernible,
Dialogue#ANGELO=When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
Dialogue#ANGELO=Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
Dialogue#ANGELO=No longer session hold upon my shame,
Dialogue#ANGELO=But let my trial be mine own confession:
Dialogue#ANGELO=Immediate sentence then and sequent death
Dialogue#ANGELO=Is all the grace I beg.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Come hither, Mariana.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?
Dialogue#ANGELO=I was, my lord.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Return him here again. Go with him, provost.
Notice#Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER and Provost
Dialogue#ESCALUS=My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Than at the strangeness of it.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Come hither, Isabel.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Advertising and holy to your business,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Not changing heart with habit, I am still
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Attorney'd at your service.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=O, give me pardon,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Your unknown sovereignty!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=You are pardon'd, Isabel:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=It was the swift celerity of his death,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Which I did think with slower foot came on,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That life is better life, past fearing death,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=So happy is your brother.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=I do, my lord.
Notice#Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and Provost
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For this new-married man approaching here,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Your well defended honour, you must pardon
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Being criminal, in double violation
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=The very mercy of the law cries out
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO='An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=We do condemn thee to the very block
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Away with him!
Dialogue#MARIANA=                  O my most gracious lord,
Dialogue#MARIANA=I hope you will not mock me with a husband.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For that he knew you, might reproach your life
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Although by confiscation they are ours,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=We do instate and widow you withal,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=To buy you a better husband.
Dialogue#MARIANA=O my dear lord,
Dialogue#MARIANA=I crave no other, nor no better man.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Never crave him; we are definitive.
Dialogue#MARIANA=Gentle my liege,--
Notice#Kneeling
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=                  You do but lose your labour.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Away with him to death!
Notice#To LUCIO
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Now, sir, to you.
Dialogue#MARIANA=O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
Dialogue#MARIANA=Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
Dialogue#MARIANA=I'll lend you all my life to do you service.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Against all sense you do importune her:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And take her hence in horror.
Dialogue#MARIANA=Isabel,
Dialogue#MARIANA=Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
Dialogue#MARIANA=Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
Dialogue#MARIANA=They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
Dialogue#MARIANA=And, for the most, become much more the better
Dialogue#MARIANA=For being a little bad: so may my husband.
Dialogue#MARIANA=O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=He dies for Claudio's death.
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Most bounteous sir,
Notice#Kneeling
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=As if my brother lived: I partly think
Dialogue#ISABELLA=A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Till he did look on me: since it is so,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=In that he did the thing for which he died:
Dialogue#ISABELLA=For Angelo,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
Dialogue#ISABELLA=And must be buried but as an intent
Dialogue#ISABELLA=That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
Dialogue#ISABELLA=Intents but merely thoughts.
Dialogue#MARIANA=Merely, my lord.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I have bethought me of another fault.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=At an unusual hour?
Dialogue#Provost=It was commanded so.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Had you a special warrant for the deed?
Dialogue#Provost=No, my good lord; it was by private message.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For which I do discharge you of your office:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Give up your keys.
Dialogue#Provost=                  Pardon me, noble lord:
Dialogue#Provost=I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
Dialogue#Provost=Yet did repent me, after more advice;
Dialogue#Provost=For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
Dialogue#Provost=That should by private order else have died,
Dialogue#Provost=I have reserved alive.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=What's he?
Dialogue#Provost=His name is Barnardine.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.
Notice#Exit Provost
Dialogue#ESCALUS=I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
Dialogue#ESCALUS=As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
Dialogue#ESCALUS=Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
Dialogue#ESCALUS=And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
Dialogue#ANGELO=I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
Dialogue#ANGELO=And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
Dialogue#ANGELO=That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
Dialogue#ANGELO='Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
Notice#Re-enter Provost, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO muffled, and JULIET
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Which is that Barnardine?
Dialogue#Provost=This, my lord.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=There was a friar told me of this man.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That apprehends no further than this world,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And pray thee take this mercy to provide
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?
Dialogue#Provost=This is another prisoner that I saved.
Dialogue#Provost=Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
Dialogue#Provost=As like almost to Claudio as himself.
Notice#Unmuffles CLAUDIO
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=[To ISABELLA]  If he be like your brother, for his sake
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Give me your hand and say you will be mine.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I find an apt remission in myself;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
Notice#To LUCIO
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Wherein have I so deserved of you,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=That you extol me thus?
Dialogue#LUCIO='Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the
Dialogue#LUCIO=trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I
Dialogue#LUCIO=had rather it would please you I might be whipt.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=As I have heard him swear himself there's one
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Let him be whipt and hang'd.
Dialogue#LUCIO=I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:
Dialogue#LUCIO=good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=And see our pleasure herein executed.
Dialogue#LUCIO=Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,
Dialogue#LUCIO=whipping, and hanging.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Slandering a prince deserves it.
Notice#Exit Officers with LUCIO
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=There's more behind that is more gratulate.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=We shill employ thee in a worthier place.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=I have a motion much imports your good;
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
Dialogue#DUKE VINCENTIO=What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.
