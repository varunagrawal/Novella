Banner#SCENE I. Venice. A street.
Notice#Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO
Dialogue#ANTONIO=In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I am to learn;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=That I have much ado to know myself.
Dialogue#SALARINO=Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
Dialogue#SALARINO=There, where your argosies with portly sail,
Dialogue#SALARINO=Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
Dialogue#SALARINO=Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
Dialogue#SALARINO=Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
Dialogue#SALARINO=That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
Dialogue#SALARINO=As they fly by them with their woven wings.
Dialogue#SALANIO=Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
Dialogue#SALANIO=The better part of my affections would
Dialogue#SALANIO=Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
Dialogue#SALANIO=Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
Dialogue#SALANIO=Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
Dialogue#SALANIO=And every object that might make me fear
Dialogue#SALANIO=Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
Dialogue#SALANIO=Would make me sad.
Dialogue#SALARINO=                  My wind cooling my broth
Dialogue#SALARINO=Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
Dialogue#SALARINO=What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
Dialogue#SALARINO=I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
Dialogue#SALARINO=But I should think of shallows and of flats,
Dialogue#SALARINO=And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
Dialogue#SALARINO=Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
Dialogue#SALARINO=To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
Dialogue#SALARINO=And see the holy edifice of stone,
Dialogue#SALARINO=And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
Dialogue#SALARINO=Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
Dialogue#SALARINO=Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
Dialogue#SALARINO=Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
Dialogue#SALARINO=And, in a word, but even now worth this,
Dialogue#SALARINO=And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
Dialogue#SALARINO=To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
Dialogue#SALARINO=That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
Dialogue#SALARINO=But tell not me; I know, Antonio
Dialogue#SALARINO=Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Upon the fortune of this present year:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
Dialogue#SALARINO=Why, then you are in love.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Fie, fie!
Dialogue#SALARINO=Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,
Dialogue#SALARINO=Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
Dialogue#SALARINO=For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
Dialogue#SALARINO=Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
Dialogue#SALARINO=Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
Dialogue#SALARINO=Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
Dialogue#SALARINO=And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
Dialogue#SALARINO=And other of such vinegar aspect
Dialogue#SALARINO=That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
Dialogue#SALARINO=Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
Notice#Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO
Dialogue#SALANIO=Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
Dialogue#SALANIO=Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
Dialogue#SALANIO=We leave you now with better company.
Dialogue#SALARINO=I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
Dialogue#SALARINO=If worthier friends had not prevented me.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Your worth is very dear in my regard.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I take it, your own business calls on you
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And you embrace the occasion to depart.
Dialogue#SALARINO=Good morrow, my good lords.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
Dialogue#BASSANIO=You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
Dialogue#SALARINO=We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
Notice#Exeunt Salarino and Salanio
Dialogue#LORENZO=My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
Dialogue#LORENZO=We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
Dialogue#LORENZO=I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I will not fail you.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=You look not well, Signior Antonio;
Dialogue#GRATIANO=You have too much respect upon the world:
Dialogue#GRATIANO=They lose it that do buy it with much care:
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Believe me, you are marvellously changed.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=A stage where every man must play a part,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And mine a sad one.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Let me play the fool:
Dialogue#GRATIANO=With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=And let my liver rather heat with wine
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
Dialogue#GRATIANO=By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--
Dialogue#GRATIANO=I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
Dialogue#GRATIANO=There are a sort of men whose visages
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=And do a wilful stillness entertain,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
Dialogue#GRATIANO=O my Antonio, I do know of these
Dialogue#GRATIANO=That therefore only are reputed wise
Dialogue#GRATIANO=For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=I'll tell thee more of this another time:
Dialogue#GRATIANO=But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
Dialogue#GRATIANO=I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
Dialogue#LORENZO=Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
Dialogue#LORENZO=I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
Dialogue#LORENZO=For Gratiano never lets me speak.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Well, keep me company but two years moe,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
Dialogue#GRATIANO=In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
Notice#Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Is that any thing now?
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
Dialogue#BASSANIO=than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
Dialogue#BASSANIO=grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
Dialogue#BASSANIO=shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
Dialogue#BASSANIO=have them, they are not worth the search.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Well, tell me now what lady is the same
Dialogue#ANTONIO=To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=That you to-day promised to tell me of?
Dialogue#BASSANIO='Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=How much I have disabled mine estate,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=By something showing a more swelling port
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Than my faint means would grant continuance:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
Dialogue#BASSANIO=From such a noble rate; but my chief care
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Wherein my time something too prodigal
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I owe the most, in money and in love,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And from your love I have a warranty
Dialogue#BASSANIO=To unburden all my plots and purposes
Dialogue#BASSANIO=How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Within the eye of honour, be assured,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=My purse, my person, my extremest means,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The self-same way with more advised watch,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Because what follows is pure innocence.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=That which I owe is lost; but if you please
Dialogue#BASSANIO=To shoot another arrow that self way
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=As I will watch the aim, or to find both
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Or bring your latter hazard back again
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=You know me well, and herein spend but time
Dialogue#ANTONIO=To wind about my love with circumstance;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
Dialogue#ANTONIO=In making question of my uttermost
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Than if you had made waste of all I have:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Then do but say to me what I should do
Dialogue#ANTONIO=That in your knowledge may by me be done,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=In Belmont is a lady richly left;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I did receive fair speechless messages:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
Dialogue#BASSANIO=To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=For the four winds blow in from every coast
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And many Jasons come in quest of her.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=O my Antonio, had I but the means
Dialogue#BASSANIO=To hold a rival place with one of them,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I have a mind presages me such thrift,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=That I should questionless be fortunate!
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Neither have I money nor commodity
Dialogue#ANTONIO=To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Try what my credit can in Venice do:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Where money is, and I no question make
Dialogue#ANTONIO=To have it of my trust or for my sake.
Notice#Exeunt
Dialogue#ANTONIO=SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
Notice#Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
Dialogue#PORTIA=By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of
Dialogue#PORTIA=this great world.
Dialogue#NERISSA=You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
Dialogue#NERISSA=the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
Dialogue#NERISSA=yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit
Dialogue#NERISSA=with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
Dialogue#NERISSA=is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the
Dialogue#NERISSA=mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
Dialogue#NERISSA=competency lives longer.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Good sentences and well pronounced.
Dialogue#NERISSA=They would be better, if well followed.
Dialogue#PORTIA=If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
Dialogue#PORTIA=do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
Dialogue#PORTIA=cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
Dialogue#PORTIA=follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
Dialogue#PORTIA=twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
Dialogue#PORTIA=twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
Dialogue#PORTIA=devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
Dialogue#PORTIA=o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
Dialogue#PORTIA=youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
Dialogue#PORTIA=cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
Dialogue#PORTIA=choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may
Dialogue#PORTIA=neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
Dialogue#PORTIA=dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
Dialogue#PORTIA=by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?
Dialogue#NERISSA=Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
Dialogue#NERISSA=death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,
Dialogue#NERISSA=that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,
Dialogue#NERISSA=silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
Dialogue#NERISSA=chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
Dialogue#NERISSA=rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
Dialogue#NERISSA=warmth is there in your affection towards any of
Dialogue#NERISSA=these princely suitors that are already come?
Dialogue#PORTIA=I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest
Dialogue#PORTIA=them, I will describe them; and, according to my
Dialogue#PORTIA=description, level at my affection.
Dialogue#NERISSA=First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but
Dialogue#PORTIA=talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
Dialogue#PORTIA=appropriation to his own good parts, that he can
Dialogue#PORTIA=shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
Dialogue#PORTIA=mother played false with a smith.
Dialogue#NERISSA=Then there is the County Palatine.
Dialogue#PORTIA=He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you
Dialogue#PORTIA=will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and
Dialogue#PORTIA=smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
Dialogue#PORTIA=philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
Dialogue#PORTIA=unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
Dialogue#PORTIA=married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
Dialogue#PORTIA=than to either of these. God defend me from these
Dialogue#PORTIA=two!
Dialogue#NERISSA=How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
Dialogue#PORTIA=God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
Dialogue#PORTIA=In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,
Dialogue#PORTIA=he! why, he hath a horse better than the
Dialogue#PORTIA=Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than
Dialogue#PORTIA=the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
Dialogue#PORTIA=throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will
Dialogue#PORTIA=fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I
Dialogue#PORTIA=should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
Dialogue#PORTIA=I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I
Dialogue#PORTIA=shall never requite him.
Dialogue#NERISSA=What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron
Dialogue#NERISSA=of England?
Dialogue#PORTIA=You know I say nothing to him, for he understands
Dialogue#PORTIA=not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,
Dialogue#PORTIA=nor Italian, and you will come into the court and
Dialogue#PORTIA=swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
Dialogue#PORTIA=He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can
Dialogue#PORTIA=converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
Dialogue#PORTIA=I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round
Dialogue#PORTIA=hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his
Dialogue#PORTIA=behavior every where.
Dialogue#NERISSA=What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
Dialogue#PORTIA=That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
Dialogue#PORTIA=borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
Dialogue#PORTIA=swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
Dialogue#PORTIA=think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
Dialogue#PORTIA=under for another.
Dialogue#NERISSA=How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
Dialogue#PORTIA=Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and
Dialogue#PORTIA=most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when
Dialogue#PORTIA=he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and
Dialogue#PORTIA=when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:
Dialogue#PORTIA=and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
Dialogue#PORTIA=make shift to go without him.
Dialogue#NERISSA=If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
Dialogue#NERISSA=casket, you should refuse to perform your father's
Dialogue#NERISSA=will, if you should refuse to accept him.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a
Dialogue#PORTIA=deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,
Dialogue#PORTIA=for if the devil be within and that temptation
Dialogue#PORTIA=without, I know he will choose it. I will do any
Dialogue#PORTIA=thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.
Dialogue#NERISSA=You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
Dialogue#NERISSA=lords: they have acquainted me with their
Dialogue#NERISSA=determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their
Dialogue#NERISSA=home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
Dialogue#NERISSA=you may be won by some other sort than your father's
Dialogue#NERISSA=imposition depending on the caskets.
Dialogue#PORTIA=If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as
Dialogue#PORTIA=chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner
Dialogue#PORTIA=of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
Dialogue#PORTIA=are so reasonable, for there is not one among them
Dialogue#PORTIA=but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant
Dialogue#PORTIA=them a fair departure.
Dialogue#NERISSA=Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
Dialogue#NERISSA=Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither
Dialogue#NERISSA=in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?
Dialogue#PORTIA=Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.
Dialogue#NERISSA=True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish
Dialogue#NERISSA=eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
Dialogue#PORTIA=I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of
Dialogue#PORTIA=thy praise.
Notice#Enter a Serving-man
Dialogue#PORTIA=How now! what news?
Dialogue#Servant=The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take
Dialogue#Servant=their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
Dialogue#Servant=fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the
Dialogue#Servant=prince his master will be here to-night.
Dialogue#PORTIA=If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
Dialogue#PORTIA=heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should
Dialogue#PORTIA=be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
Dialogue#PORTIA=of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had
Dialogue#PORTIA=rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Whiles we shut the gates
Dialogue#PORTIA=upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.
Notice#Exeunt
Banner#SCENE III. Venice. A public place.
Notice#Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Three thousand ducats; well.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Ay, sir, for three months.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=For three months; well.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Antonio shall become bound; well.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
Dialogue#BASSANIO=know your answer?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Your answer to that.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Antonio is a good man.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=good man is to have you understand me that he is
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=take his bond.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Be assured you may.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?
Dialogue#BASSANIO=If it please you to dine with us.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?
Notice#Enter ANTONIO
Dialogue#BASSANIO=This is Signior Antonio.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=[Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I hate him for he is a Christian,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=But more for that in low simplicity
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=He lends out money gratis and brings down
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=If I can catch him once upon the hip,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Even there where merchants most do congregate,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=If I forgive him!
Dialogue#BASSANIO=                  Shylock, do you hear?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I am debating of my present store,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=And, by the near guess of my memory,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I cannot instantly raise up the gross
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Do you desire?
Notice#To ANTONIO
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Rest you fair, good signior;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
Dialogue#ANTONIO=By taking nor by giving of excess,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
Dialogue#ANTONIO=How much ye would?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=                  Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And for three months.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Upon advantage.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=                  I do never use it.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=The third possessor; ay, he was the third--
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And what of him? did he take interest?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=When Laban and himself were compromised
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=And, when the work of generation was
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Between these woolly breeders in the act,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Who then conceiving did in eaning time
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Was this inserted to make interest good?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=But note me, signior.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Mark you this, Bassanio,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=An evil soul producing holy witness
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=In the Rialto you have rated me
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=About my moneys and my usances:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=And all for use of that which is mine own.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Well then, it now appears you need my help:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
Dialogue#SHYLOCK='Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=What should I say to you? Should I not say
Dialogue#SHYLOCK='Hath a dog money? is it possible
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK='Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=You spurn'd me such a day; another time
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I'll lend you thus much moneys'?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I am as like to call thee so again,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
Dialogue#ANTONIO=As to thy friends; for when did friendship take

Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My

Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,

Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the

Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil

Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel

Dialogue#GOBBO=Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of

Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=your son: give me your blessing: truth will come

Dialogue#GOBBO=I cannot think you are my son.
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=I know not what I shall think of that: but I am

Dialogue#GOBBO=Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou

Dialogue#GOBBO=Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou
Dialogue#GOBBO=got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
Dialogue#GOBBO=Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail

Dialogue#GOBBO=Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy

Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=and have a desire, as my father shall specify--
Dialogue#GOBBO=His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,

Dialogue#GRATIANO=With that keen appetite that he sits down?
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Where is the horse that doth untread again
Dialogue#GRATIANO=His tedious measures with the unbated fire

Dialogue#GRATIANO=How like a younker or a prodigal

Dialogue#JESSICA=To see me thus transformed to a boy.

Dialogue#PORTIA=If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
Dialogue#MOROCCO=Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
Dialogue#MOROCCO=I will survey the inscriptions back again.
Dialogue#MOROCCO=What says this leaden casket?
Dialogue#MOROCCO='Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
Dialogue#MOROCCO=Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
Dialogue#MOROCCO=This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
Dialogue#MOROCCO=Do it in hope of fair advantages:
Dialogue#MOROCCO=A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;

Dialogue#MOROCCO=What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?
Dialogue#MOROCCO=Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
Dialogue#MOROCCO='Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
Dialogue#MOROCCO=Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;
Dialogue#MOROCCO=From the four corners of the earth they come,
Dialogue#MOROCCO=To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:
Dialogue#MOROCCO=The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
Dialogue#MOROCCO=Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
Dialogue#MOROCCO=For princes to come view fair Portia:

Dialogue#MOROCCO=Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
Dialogue#MOROCCO=To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
Dialogue#MOROCCO=As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.
Dialogue#MOROCCO=One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
Dialogue#MOROCCO=Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation

Dialogue#MOROCCO=To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
Dialogue#MOROCCO=Or shall I think in silver she's immured,
Dialogue#MOROCCO=Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
Dialogue#MOROCCO=O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
Dialogue#MOROCCO=Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
Dialogue#MOROCCO=A coin that bears the figure of an angel
Dialogue#MOROCCO=Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;

Dialogue#SALARINO=They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
Dialogue#SALANIO=I never heard a passion so confused,
Dialogue#SALANIO=So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
Dialogue#SALANIO=As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
Dialogue#SALANIO='My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
Dialogue#SALANIO=Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
Dialogue#SALANIO=Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!
Dialogue#SALANIO=A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,

Dialogue#SALARINO=A vessel of our country richly fraught:
Dialogue#SALARINO=I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
Dialogue#SALARINO=And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
Dialogue#SALANIO=You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
Dialogue#SALANIO=Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
Dialogue#SALARINO=A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
Dialogue#SALARINO=I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
Dialogue#SALARINO=Bassanio told him he would make some speed
Dialogue#SALARINO=Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;
Dialogue#SALARINO=Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio
Dialogue#SALARINO=But stay the very riping of the time;
Dialogue#SALARINO=And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
Dialogue#SALARINO=Let it not enter in your mind of love:
Dialogue#SALARINO=Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
Dialogue#SALARINO=To courtship and such fair ostents of love
Dialogue#SALARINO=As shall conveniently become you there:'
Dialogue#SALARINO=And even there, his eye being big with tears,
Dialogue#SALARINO=Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
Dialogue#SALARINO=And with affection wondrous sensible
Dialogue#SALARINO=He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.
Dialogue#SALANIO=I think he only loves the world for him.
Dialogue#SALANIO=I pray thee, let us go and find him out
Dialogue#SALANIO=And quicken his embraced heaviness

Dialogue#ARRAGON=You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
Dialogue#ARRAGON=What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
Dialogue#ARRAGON='Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
Dialogue#ARRAGON=What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
Dialogue#ARRAGON=By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
Dialogue#ARRAGON=Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
Dialogue#ARRAGON=Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
Dialogue#ARRAGON=Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
Dialogue#ARRAGON=Even in the force and road of casualty.
Dialogue#ARRAGON=I will not choose what many men desire,
Dialogue#ARRAGON=Because I will not jump with common spirits

Dialogue#ARRAGON=Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
Dialogue#ARRAGON=Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
Dialogue#ARRAGON='Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
Dialogue#ARRAGON=And well said too; for who shall go about
Dialogue#ARRAGON=To cozen fortune and be honourable
Dialogue#ARRAGON=Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
Dialogue#ARRAGON=To wear an undeserved dignity.
Dialogue#ARRAGON=O, that estates, degrees and offices
Dialogue#ARRAGON=Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
Dialogue#ARRAGON=Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
Dialogue#ARRAGON=How many then should cover that stand bare!
Dialogue#ARRAGON=How many be commanded that command!
Dialogue#ARRAGON=How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
Dialogue#ARRAGON=From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
Dialogue#ARRAGON=Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
Dialogue#ARRAGON=To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:

Dialogue#ARRAGON=How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
Dialogue#ARRAGON='Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
Dialogue#ARRAGON=Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
Dialogue#ARRAGON=Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?
Dialogue#PORTIA=To offend, and judge, are distinct offices
Dialogue#PORTIA=And of opposed natures.

Dialogue#SALARINO=than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
Dialogue#SALARINO=tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any
Dialogue#SALARINO=loss at sea or no?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the

Dialogue#SHYLOCK=mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,

Dialogue#SHYLOCK=the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by

Dialogue#PORTIA=There's something tells me, but it is not love,
Dialogue#PORTIA=I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Hate counsels not in such a quality.
Dialogue#PORTIA=But lest you should not understand me well,--
Dialogue#PORTIA=And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
Dialogue#PORTIA=I would detain you here some month or two
Dialogue#PORTIA=Before you venture for me. I could teach you
Dialogue#PORTIA=How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
Dialogue#PORTIA=So will I never be: so may you miss me;
Dialogue#PORTIA=But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
Dialogue#PORTIA=That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
Dialogue#PORTIA=They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
Dialogue#PORTIA=One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
Dialogue#PORTIA=And so all yours. O, these naughty times
Dialogue#PORTIA=Put bars between the owners and their rights!
Dialogue#PORTIA=And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
Dialogue#PORTIA=I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,
Dialogue#PORTIA=To eke it and to draw it out in length,
Dialogue#PORTIA=To stay you from election.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Let me choose
Dialogue#BASSANIO=For as I am, I live upon the rack.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess
Dialogue#PORTIA=What treason there is mingled with your love.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=There may as well be amity and life
Dialogue#BASSANIO='Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Where men enforced do speak anything.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Well then, confess and live.
Dialogue#BASSANIO='Confess' and 'love'
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Had been the very sum of my confession:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=O happy torment, when my torturer
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
Dialogue#BASSANIO=But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:
Dialogue#PORTIA=If you do love me, you will find me out.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
Dialogue#PORTIA=Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Fading in music: that the comparison
Dialogue#PORTIA=May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
Dialogue#PORTIA=And watery death-bed for him. He may win;
Dialogue#PORTIA=And what is music then? Then music is
Dialogue#PORTIA=Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
Dialogue#PORTIA=To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
Dialogue#PORTIA=As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
Dialogue#PORTIA=That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,
Dialogue#PORTIA=And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
Dialogue#PORTIA=With no less presence, but with much more love,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
Dialogue#PORTIA=The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
Dialogue#PORTIA=To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
Dialogue#PORTIA=The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
Dialogue#PORTIA=With bleared visages, come forth to view
Dialogue#PORTIA=The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!
Dialogue#PORTIA=Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
Dialogue#PORTIA=I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
Notice#Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself
Dialogue#PORTIA=SONG.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Tell me where is fancy bred,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Or in the heart, or in the head?
Dialogue#PORTIA=How begot, how nourished?
Dialogue#PORTIA=Reply, reply.
Dialogue#PORTIA=It is engender'd in the eyes,
Dialogue#PORTIA=With gazing fed; and fancy dies
Dialogue#PORTIA=In the cradle where it lies.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Let us all ring fancy's knell
Dialogue#PORTIA=I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.
Dialogue#ALL=Ding, dong, bell.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=So may the outward shows be least themselves:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The world is still deceived with ornament.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=What damned error, but some sober brow
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Will bless it and approve it with a text,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
Dialogue#BASSANIO=There is no vice so simple but assumes
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
Dialogue#BASSANIO=As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And these assume but valour's excrement
Dialogue#BASSANIO=To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Which therein works a miracle in nature,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Making them lightest that wear most of it:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=So are those crisped snaky golden locks
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Upon supposed fairness, often known
Dialogue#BASSANIO=To be the dowry of a second head,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
Dialogue#BASSANIO=To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The seeming truth which cunning times put on
Dialogue#BASSANIO=To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
Dialogue#BASSANIO='Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And here choose I; joy be the consequence!
Dialogue#PORTIA=[Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air,
Dialogue#PORTIA=As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,
Dialogue#PORTIA=And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,
Dialogue#PORTIA=In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.
Dialogue#PORTIA=I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,
Dialogue#PORTIA=For fear I surfeit.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=What find I here?
Notice#Opening the leaden casket
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The painter plays the spider and hath woven
Dialogue#BASSANIO=A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
Dialogue#BASSANIO=How could he see to do them? having made one,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Methinks it should have power to steal both his
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
Dialogue#BASSANIO=In underprizing it, so far this shadow
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The continent and summary of my fortune.
Notice#Reads
Dialogue#BASSANIO=You that choose not by the view,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Chance as fair and choose as true!
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Since this fortune falls to you,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Be content and seek no new,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=If you be well pleased with this
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And hold your fortune for your bliss,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Turn you where your lady is
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And claim her with a loving kiss.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I come by note, to give and to receive.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Like one of two contending in a prize,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Hearing applause and universal shout,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=As doubtful whether what I see be true,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.
Dialogue#PORTIA=You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Such as I am: though for myself alone
Dialogue#PORTIA=I would not be ambitious in my wish,
Dialogue#PORTIA=To wish myself much better; yet, for you
Dialogue#PORTIA=I would be trebled twenty times myself;
Dialogue#PORTIA=A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;
Dialogue#PORTIA=That only to stand high in your account,
Dialogue#PORTIA=I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Exceed account; but the full sum of me
Dialogue#PORTIA=Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;
Dialogue#PORTIA=Happy in this, she is not yet so old
Dialogue#PORTIA=But she may learn; happier than this,
Dialogue#PORTIA=She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
Dialogue#PORTIA=Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
Dialogue#PORTIA=Commits itself to yours to be directed,
Dialogue#PORTIA=As from her lord, her governor, her king.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Myself and what is mine to you and yours
Dialogue#PORTIA=Is now converted: but now I was the lord
Dialogue#PORTIA=Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,
Dialogue#PORTIA=This house, these servants and this same myself
Dialogue#PORTIA=Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;
Dialogue#PORTIA=Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Let it presage the ruin of your love
Dialogue#PORTIA=And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And there is such confusion in my powers,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=As after some oration fairly spoke
Dialogue#BASSANIO=By a beloved prince, there doth appear
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Where every something, being blent together,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!
Dialogue#NERISSA=My lord and lady, it is now our time,
Dialogue#NERISSA=That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,
Dialogue#NERISSA=To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!
Dialogue#GRATIANO=My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
Dialogue#GRATIANO=For I am sure you can wish none from me:
Dialogue#GRATIANO=And when your honours mean to solemnize
Dialogue#GRATIANO=The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Even at that time I may be married too.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
Dialogue#GRATIANO=You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
Dialogue#GRATIANO=You loved, I loved for intermission.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Your fortune stood upon the casket there,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
Dialogue#GRATIANO=For wooing here until I sweat again,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=And sweating until my very roof was dry
Dialogue#GRATIANO=With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=I got a promise of this fair one here
Dialogue#GRATIANO=To have her love, provided that your fortune
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Achieved her mistress.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Is this true, Nerissa?
Dialogue#NERISSA=Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Yes, faith, my lord.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
Dialogue#NERISSA=What, and stake down?
Dialogue#GRATIANO=No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
Notice#Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger from Venice

Dialogue#BASSANIO=I bid my very friends and countrymen,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Sweet Portia, welcome.
Dialogue#PORTIA=So do I, my lord:
Dialogue#PORTIA=They are entirely welcome.
Dialogue#LORENZO=I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
Dialogue#LORENZO=My purpose was not to have seen you here;
Dialogue#LORENZO=But meeting with Salerio by the way,
Dialogue#LORENZO=He did entreat me, past all saying nay,
Dialogue#LORENZO=To come with him along.
Dialogue#SALERIO=I did, my lord;
Dialogue#SALERIO=And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
Dialogue#SALERIO=Commends him to you.
Notice#Gives Bassanio a letter
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Ere I ope his letter,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.
Dialogue#SALERIO=Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
Dialogue#SALERIO=Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there
Dialogue#SALERIO=Will show you his estate.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?
Dialogue#GRATIANO=How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
Dialogue#GRATIANO=I know he will be glad of our success;
Dialogue#GRATIANO=We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
Dialogue#SALERIO=I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
Dialogue#PORTIA=There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,
Dialogue#PORTIA=That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
Dialogue#PORTIA=Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world
Dialogue#PORTIA=Could turn so much the constitution
Dialogue#PORTIA=Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
Dialogue#PORTIA=With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,
Dialogue#PORTIA=And I must freely have the half of anything
Dialogue#PORTIA=That this same paper brings you.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=O sweet Portia,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
Dialogue#BASSANIO=That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=When I did first impart my love to you,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I freely told you, all the wealth I had
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
Dialogue#BASSANIO=How much I was a braggart. When I told you
Dialogue#BASSANIO=My state was nothing, I should then have told you
Dialogue#BASSANIO=That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The paper as the body of my friend,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And every word in it a gaping wound,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
Dialogue#BASSANIO=From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Of merchant-marring rocks?
Dialogue#SALERIO=Not one, my lord.
Dialogue#SALERIO=Besides, it should appear, that if he had
Dialogue#SALERIO=The present money to discharge the Jew,
Dialogue#SALERIO=He would not take it. Never did I know
Dialogue#SALERIO=A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
Dialogue#SALERIO=So keen and greedy to confound a man:
Dialogue#SALERIO=He plies the duke at morning and at night,
Dialogue#SALERIO=And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
Dialogue#SALERIO=If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
Dialogue#SALERIO=The duke himself, and the magnificoes
Dialogue#SALERIO=Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;
Dialogue#SALERIO=But none can drive him from the envious plea
Dialogue#SALERIO=Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
Dialogue#JESSICA=When I was with him I have heard him swear
Dialogue#JESSICA=To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
Dialogue#JESSICA=That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
Dialogue#JESSICA=Than twenty times the value of the sum
Dialogue#JESSICA=That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,
Dialogue#JESSICA=If law, authority and power deny not,
Dialogue#JESSICA=It will go hard with poor Antonio.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
Dialogue#BASSANIO=In doing courtesies, and one in whom
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The ancient Roman honour more appears
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Than any that draws breath in Italy.
Dialogue#PORTIA=What sum owes he the Jew?
Dialogue#BASSANIO=For me three thousand ducats.
Dialogue#PORTIA=What, no more?
Dialogue#PORTIA=Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
Dialogue#PORTIA=Double six thousand, and then treble that,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Before a friend of this description
Dialogue#PORTIA=Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
Dialogue#PORTIA=First go with me to church and call me wife,
Dialogue#PORTIA=And then away to Venice to your friend;
Dialogue#PORTIA=For never shall you lie by Portia's side
Dialogue#PORTIA=With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
Dialogue#PORTIA=To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
Dialogue#PORTIA=When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
Dialogue#PORTIA=My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
Dialogue#PORTIA=Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!
Dialogue#PORTIA=For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
Dialogue#PORTIA=Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:
Dialogue#PORTIA=Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
Dialogue#PORTIA=But let me hear the letter of your friend.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=[Reads]  Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all
Dialogue#BASSANIO=miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is
Dialogue#BASSANIO=very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since
Dialogue#BASSANIO=in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all
Dialogue#BASSANIO=debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but
Dialogue#BASSANIO=see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your
Dialogue#BASSANIO=pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=let not my letter.
Dialogue#PORTIA=O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Since I have your good leave to go away,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I will make haste: but, till I come again,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.

Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=To come abroad with him at his request.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I pray thee, hear me speak.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,

Dialogue#ANTONIO=I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Many that have at times made moan to me;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Therefore he hates me.
Dialogue#SALARINO=I am sure the duke
Dialogue#SALARINO=Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=The duke cannot deny the course of law:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=For the commodity that strangers have
Dialogue#ANTONIO=With us in Venice, if it be denied,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Will much impeach the justice of his state;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Since that the trade and profit of the city
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=These griefs and losses have so bated me,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh

Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=hope neither.
Dialogue#JESSICA=And what hope is that, I pray thee?
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.
Dialogue#JESSICA=That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the
Dialogue#JESSICA=sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=gone both ways.
Dialogue#JESSICA=I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a
Dialogue#JESSICA=Christian.
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=another. This making Christians will raise the
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
Notice#Enter LORENZO
Dialogue#JESSICA=I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.
Dialogue#LORENZO=I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if
Dialogue#LORENZO=you thus get my wife into corners.
Dialogue#JESSICA=Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I
Dialogue#JESSICA=are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for
Dialogue#JESSICA=me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he
Dialogue#JESSICA=says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,
Dialogue#JESSICA=for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the
Dialogue#JESSICA=price of pork.
Dialogue#LORENZO=I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
Dialogue#LORENZO=you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the
Dialogue#LORENZO=Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=but if she be less than an honest woman, she is
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=indeed more than I took her for.
Dialogue#LORENZO=How every fool can play upon the word! I think the
Dialogue#LORENZO=best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,
Dialogue#LORENZO=and discourse grow commendable in none only but
Dialogue#LORENZO=parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
Dialogue#LORENZO=Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid
Dialogue#LORENZO=them prepare dinner.
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word.
Dialogue#LORENZO=Will you cover then, sir?
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
Dialogue#LORENZO=Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show
Dialogue#LORENZO=the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray
Dialogue#LORENZO=tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:
Dialogue#LORENZO=go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve
Dialogue#LORENZO=in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and
Dialogue#LAUNCELOT=conceits shall govern.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#LORENZO=O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
Dialogue#LORENZO=The fool hath planted in his memory
Dialogue#LORENZO=An army of good words; and I do know
Dialogue#LORENZO=A many fools, that stand in better place,
Dialogue#LORENZO=Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
Dialogue#LORENZO=Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?
Dialogue#LORENZO=And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,
Dialogue#LORENZO=How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?
Dialogue#JESSICA=Past all expressing. It is very meet
Dialogue#JESSICA=The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;
Dialogue#JESSICA=For, having such a blessing in his lady,
Dialogue#JESSICA=He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
Dialogue#JESSICA=And if on earth he do not mean it, then
Dialogue#JESSICA=In reason he should never come to heaven
Dialogue#JESSICA=Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match
Dialogue#JESSICA=And on the wager lay two earthly women,
Dialogue#JESSICA=And Portia one, there must be something else
Dialogue#JESSICA=Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world
Dialogue#JESSICA=Hath not her fellow.
Dialogue#LORENZO=Even such a husband
Dialogue#LORENZO=Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
Dialogue#JESSICA=Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
Dialogue#LORENZO=I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.
Dialogue#JESSICA=Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
Dialogue#LORENZO=No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;
Dialogue#LORENZO='	Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things
Dialogue#LORENZO=I shall digest it.
Dialogue#JESSICA=                  Well, I'll set you forth.

Notice#Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others
Dialogue#DUKE=What, is Antonio here?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Ready, so please your grace.
Dialogue#DUKE=I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
Dialogue#DUKE=A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
Dialogue#DUKE=uncapable of pity, void and empty
Dialogue#DUKE=From any dram of mercy.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I have heard
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
Dialogue#ANTONIO=His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And that no lawful means can carry me
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
Dialogue#ANTONIO=My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
Dialogue#ANTONIO=To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=The very tyranny and rage of his.
Dialogue#DUKE=Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
Dialogue#SALERIO=He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.
Notice#Enter SHYLOCK
Dialogue#DUKE=Make room, and let him stand before our face.
Dialogue#DUKE=Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
Dialogue#DUKE=That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
Dialogue#DUKE=To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
Dialogue#DUKE=Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
Dialogue#DUKE=Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
Dialogue#DUKE=And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
Dialogue#DUKE=Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
Dialogue#DUKE=Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
Dialogue#DUKE=But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
Dialogue#DUKE=Forgive a moiety of the principal;
Dialogue#DUKE=Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
Dialogue#DUKE=That have of late so huddled on his back,
Dialogue#DUKE=Enow to press a royal merchant down
Dialogue#DUKE=And pluck commiseration of his state
Dialogue#DUKE=From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
Dialogue#DUKE=From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
Dialogue#DUKE=To offices of tender courtesy.
Dialogue#DUKE=We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=If you deny it, let the danger light
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=What if my house be troubled with a rat
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Must yield to such inevitable shame
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=As to offend, himself being offended;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?
Dialogue#BASSANIO=This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Do all men kill the things they do not love?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Every offence is not a hate at first.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=You may as well go stand upon the beach
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=You may as well use question with the wolf
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=You may as well forbid the mountain pines
Dialogue#ANTONIO=To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=You may as well do anything most hard,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
Dialogue#ANTONIO=His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Make no more offers, use no farther means,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=But with all brief and plain conveniency
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=What judgment shall I dread, doing
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I would not draw them; I would have my bond.
Dialogue#DUKE=How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=You have among you many a purchased slave,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=You use in abject and in slavish parts,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Be season'd with such viands? You will answer
Dialogue#SHYLOCK='The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=If you deny me, fie upon your law!
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?
Dialogue#DUKE=Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
Dialogue#DUKE=Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
Dialogue#DUKE=Whom I have sent for to determine this,
Dialogue#DUKE=Come here to-day.
Dialogue#SALERIO=                  My lord, here stays without
Dialogue#SALERIO=A messenger with letters from the doctor,
Dialogue#SALERIO=New come from Padua.
Dialogue#DUKE=Bring us the letter; call the messenger.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I am a tainted wether of the flock,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
Dialogue#ANTONIO=You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
Notice#Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk
Dialogue#DUKE=Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
Dialogue#NERISSA=From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.
Notice#Presenting a letter
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
Dialogue#GRATIANO=And for thy life let justice be accused.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
Dialogue#GRATIANO=To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=That souls of animals infuse themselves
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.
Dialogue#DUKE=This letter from Bellario doth commend
Dialogue#DUKE=A young and learned doctor to our court.
Dialogue#DUKE=Where is he?
Dialogue#NERISSA=                  He attendeth here hard by,
Dialogue#NERISSA=To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.
Dialogue#DUKE=With all my heart. Some three or four of you
Dialogue#DUKE=Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
Dialogue#DUKE=Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.
Dialogue#Clerk=[Reads]
Dialogue#Clerk=Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
Dialogue#Clerk=your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
Dialogue#Clerk=your messenger came, in loving visitation was with
Dialogue#Clerk=me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
Dialogue#Clerk=acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
Dialogue#Clerk=the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er
Dialogue#Clerk=many books together: he is furnished with my
Dialogue#Clerk=opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the
Dialogue#Clerk=greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
Dialogue#Clerk=with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's
Dialogue#Clerk=request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of
Dialogue#Clerk=years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
Dialogue#Clerk=estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
Dialogue#Clerk=old a head. I leave him to your gracious
Dialogue#Clerk=acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his
Dialogue#Clerk=commendation.
Dialogue#DUKE=You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
Dialogue#DUKE=And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
Notice#Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws
Dialogue#DUKE=Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
Dialogue#PORTIA=I did, my lord.
Dialogue#DUKE=                  You are welcome: take your place.
Dialogue#DUKE=Are you acquainted with the difference
Dialogue#DUKE=That holds this present question in the court?
Dialogue#PORTIA=I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
Dialogue#DUKE=Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Is your name Shylock?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Shylock is my name.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
Dialogue#PORTIA=Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
Dialogue#PORTIA=Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
Dialogue#PORTIA=You stand within his danger, do you not?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Ay, so he says.
Dialogue#PORTIA=                  Do you confess the bond?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I do.
Dialogue#PORTIA=    Then must the Jew be merciful.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=On what compulsion must I? tell me that.
Dialogue#PORTIA=The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
Dialogue#PORTIA=It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Dialogue#PORTIA=Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
Dialogue#PORTIA=It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
Dialogue#PORTIA='Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
Dialogue#PORTIA=The throned monarch better than his crown;
Dialogue#PORTIA=His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
Dialogue#PORTIA=The attribute to awe and majesty,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
Dialogue#PORTIA=But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
Dialogue#PORTIA=It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
Dialogue#PORTIA=It is an attribute to God himself;
Dialogue#PORTIA=And earthly power doth then show likest God's
Dialogue#PORTIA=When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
Dialogue#PORTIA=That, in the course of justice, none of us
Dialogue#PORTIA=Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
Dialogue#PORTIA=And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
Dialogue#PORTIA=The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
Dialogue#PORTIA=To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Dialogue#PORTIA=Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Dialogue#PORTIA=Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Is he not able to discharge the money?
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=If this will not suffice, it must appear
Dialogue#BASSANIO=That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Wrest once the law to your authority:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=To do a great right, do a little wrong,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And curb this cruel devil of his will.
Dialogue#PORTIA=It must not be; there is no power in Venice
Dialogue#PORTIA=Can alter a decree established:
Dialogue#PORTIA='Twill be recorded for a precedent,
Dialogue#PORTIA=And many an error by the same example
Dialogue#PORTIA=Will rush into the state: it cannot be.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!
Dialogue#PORTIA=I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=No, not for Venice.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Why, this bond is forfeit;
Dialogue#PORTIA=And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
Dialogue#PORTIA=A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
Dialogue#PORTIA=Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
Dialogue#PORTIA=Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=When it is paid according to the tenor.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=You know the law, your exposition
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=There is no power in the tongue of man
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=To alter me: I stay here on my bond.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Most heartily I do beseech the court
Dialogue#ANTONIO=To give the judgment.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Why then, thus it is:
Dialogue#PORTIA=You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=O noble judge! O excellent young man!
Dialogue#PORTIA=For the intent and purpose of the law
Dialogue#PORTIA=Hath full relation to the penalty,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK='Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
Dialogue#PORTIA=Therefore lay bare your bosom.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Ay, his breast:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK='Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.
Dialogue#PORTIA=It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
Dialogue#PORTIA=The flesh?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=         I have them ready.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
Dialogue#PORTIA=To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Is it so nominated in the bond?
Dialogue#PORTIA=It is not so express'd: but what of that?
Dialogue#PORTIA='Twere good you do so much for charity.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
Dialogue#PORTIA=You, merchant, have you any thing to say?
Dialogue#ANTONIO=But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Than is her custom: it is still her use
Dialogue#ANTONIO=To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
Dialogue#ANTONIO=An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Of such misery doth she cut me off.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Commend me to your honourable wife:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And he repents not that he pays your debt;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I'll pay it presently with all my heart.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Antonio, I am married to a wife
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Which is as dear to me as life itself;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Here to this devil, to deliver you.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
Dialogue#PORTIA=If she were by, to hear you make the offer.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
Dialogue#GRATIANO=I would she were in heaven, so she could
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
Dialogue#NERISSA='Tis well you offer it behind her back;
Dialogue#NERISSA=The wish would make else an unquiet house.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Would any of the stock of Barrabas
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
Notice#Aside
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.
Dialogue#PORTIA=A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
Dialogue#PORTIA=The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Most rightful judge!
Dialogue#PORTIA=And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
Dialogue#PORTIA=The law allows it, and the court awards it.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!
Dialogue#PORTIA=Tarry a little; there is something else.
Dialogue#PORTIA=This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
Dialogue#PORTIA=The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
Dialogue#PORTIA=Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
Dialogue#PORTIA=But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
Dialogue#PORTIA=One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
Dialogue#PORTIA=Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
Dialogue#PORTIA=Unto the state of Venice.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Is that the law?
Dialogue#PORTIA=                  Thyself shalt see the act:
Dialogue#PORTIA=For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
Dialogue#PORTIA=Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=And let the Christian go.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Here is the money.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Soft!
Dialogue#PORTIA=The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
Dialogue#PORTIA=He shall have nothing but the penalty.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
Dialogue#PORTIA=Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
Dialogue#PORTIA=But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
Dialogue#PORTIA=Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
Dialogue#PORTIA=As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Or the division of the twentieth part
Dialogue#PORTIA=Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
Dialogue#PORTIA=But in the estimation of a hair,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Give me my principal, and let me go.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I have it ready for thee; here it is.
Dialogue#PORTIA=He hath refused it in the open court:
Dialogue#PORTIA=He shall have merely justice and his bond.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
Dialogue#GRATIANO=I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Shall I not have barely my principal?
Dialogue#PORTIA=Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
Dialogue#PORTIA=To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Why, then the devil give him good of it!
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I'll stay no longer question.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Tarry, Jew:
Dialogue#PORTIA=The law hath yet another hold on you.
Dialogue#PORTIA=It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
Dialogue#PORTIA=If it be proved against an alien
Dialogue#PORTIA=That by direct or indirect attempts
Dialogue#PORTIA=He seek the life of any citizen,
Dialogue#PORTIA=The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
Dialogue#PORTIA=Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
Dialogue#PORTIA=Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
Dialogue#PORTIA=And the offender's life lies in the mercy
Dialogue#PORTIA=Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
Dialogue#PORTIA=In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
Dialogue#PORTIA=For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
Dialogue#PORTIA=That indirectly and directly too
Dialogue#PORTIA=Thou hast contrived against the very life
Dialogue#PORTIA=Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
Dialogue#PORTIA=The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
Dialogue#GRATIANO=And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
Dialogue#DUKE=That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
Dialogue#DUKE=I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
Dialogue#DUKE=For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
Dialogue#DUKE=The other half comes to the general state,
Dialogue#DUKE=Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=You take my house when you do take the prop
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=That doth sustain my house; you take my life
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=When you do take the means whereby I live.
Dialogue#PORTIA=What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
Dialogue#GRATIANO=A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=So please my lord the duke and all the court
Dialogue#ANTONIO=To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I am content; so he will let me have
Dialogue#ANTONIO=The other half in use, to render it,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Upon his death, unto the gentleman

Dialogue#ANTONIO=Two things provided more, that, for this favour,

Dialogue#ANTONIO=The other, that he do record a gift,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
Dialogue#DUKE=He shall do this, or else I do recant
Dialogue#DUKE=The pardon that I late pronounced here.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I am content.
Dialogue#PORTIA=                  Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=I am not well: send the deed after me,
Dialogue#SHYLOCK=And I will sign it.
Dialogue#DUKE=Get thee gone, but do it.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.

Dialogue#ANTONIO=In love and service to you evermore.
Dialogue#PORTIA=He is well paid that is well satisfied;

Dialogue#PORTIA=And therein do account myself well paid:
Dialogue#PORTIA=My mind was never yet more mercenary.
Dialogue#PORTIA=I pray you, know me when we meet again:
Dialogue#PORTIA=I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Not to deny me, and to pardon me.

Dialogue#BASSANIO=This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I will not shame myself to give you this.
Dialogue#PORTIA=I will have nothing else but only this;
Dialogue#PORTIA=And now methinks I have a mind to it.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=There's more depends on this than on the value.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And find it out by proclamation:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.
Dialogue#PORTIA=I see, sir, you are liberal in offers
Dialogue#PORTIA=You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
Dialogue#PORTIA=You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And when she put it on, she made me vow
Dialogue#BASSANIO=That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
Dialogue#PORTIA=That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
Dialogue#PORTIA=An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
Dialogue#PORTIA=And know how well I have deserved the ring,
Dialogue#PORTIA=She would not hold out enemy for ever,
Dialogue#PORTIA=For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!

Dialogue#JESSICA=I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
Dialogue#LORENZO=The reason is, your spirits are attentive:
Dialogue#LORENZO=For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
Dialogue#LORENZO=Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
Dialogue#LORENZO=Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
Dialogue#LORENZO=Which is the hot condition of their blood;
Dialogue#LORENZO=If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
Dialogue#LORENZO=Or any air of music touch their ears,
Dialogue#LORENZO=You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
Dialogue#LORENZO=Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
Dialogue#LORENZO=By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
Dialogue#LORENZO=Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;
Dialogue#LORENZO=Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,
Dialogue#LORENZO=But music for the time doth change his nature.
Dialogue#LORENZO=The man that hath no music in himself,
Dialogue#LORENZO=Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
Dialogue#LORENZO=Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;

Dialogue#PORTIA=Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
Dialogue#PORTIA=Into the main of waters. Music! hark!
Dialogue#NERISSA=It is your music, madam, of the house.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
Dialogue#PORTIA=Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
Dialogue#NERISSA=Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
Dialogue#PORTIA=The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,
Dialogue#PORTIA=When neither is attended, and I think
Dialogue#PORTIA=The nightingale, if she should sing by day,

Dialogue#PORTIA=No better a musician than the wren.

Dialogue#PORTIA=And never be Bassanio so for me:
Dialogue#PORTIA=But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=This is the man, this is Antonio,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=To whom I am so infinitely bound.
Dialogue#PORTIA=You should in all sense be much bound to him.
Dialogue#PORTIA=For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=No more than I am well acquitted of.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Sir, you are very welcome to our house:
Dialogue#PORTIA=It must appear in other ways than words,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=[To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
Dialogue#GRATIANO=In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.
Dialogue#PORTIA=A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?
Dialogue#GRATIANO=About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
Dialogue#GRATIANO=That she did give me, whose posy was
Dialogue#GRATIANO=For all the world like cutler's poetry
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Upon  a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'
Dialogue#NERISSA=What talk you of the posy or the value?
Dialogue#NERISSA=You swore to me, when I did give it you,
Dialogue#NERISSA=That you would wear it till your hour of death
Dialogue#NERISSA=And that it should lie with you in your grave:
Dialogue#NERISSA=Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
Dialogue#NERISSA=You should have been respective and have kept it.
Dialogue#NERISSA=Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
Dialogue#NERISSA=The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=He will, an if he live to be a man.
Dialogue#NERISSA=Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:
Dialogue#GRATIANO=I could not for my heart deny it him.
Dialogue#PORTIA=You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
Dialogue#PORTIA=To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
Dialogue#PORTIA=A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
Dialogue#PORTIA=And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
Dialogue#PORTIA=I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Dialogue#PORTIA=Never to part with it; and here he stands;
Dialogue#PORTIA=I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
Dialogue#PORTIA=Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
Dialogue#PORTIA=That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,
Dialogue#PORTIA=You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
Dialogue#PORTIA=An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=[Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And swear I lost the ring defending it.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;
Dialogue#GRATIANO=And neither man nor master would take aught
Dialogue#GRATIANO=But the two rings.
Dialogue#PORTIA=What ring gave you my lord?
Dialogue#PORTIA=Not that, I hope, which you received of me.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=If I could add a lie unto a fault,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I would deny it; but you see my finger
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Even so void is your false heart of truth.
Dialogue#PORTIA=By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
Dialogue#PORTIA=Until I see the ring.
Dialogue#NERISSA=Nor I in yours
Dialogue#NERISSA=Till I again see mine.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Sweet Portia,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=If you did know for whom I gave the ring
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And would conceive for what I gave the ring
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And how unwillingly I left the ring,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=When nought would be accepted but the ring,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
Dialogue#PORTIA=If you had known the virtue of the ring,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Or your own honour to contain the ring,
Dialogue#PORTIA=You would not then have parted with the ring.
Dialogue#PORTIA=What man is there so much unreasonable,
Dialogue#PORTIA=If you had pleased to have defended it
Dialogue#PORTIA=With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
Dialogue#PORTIA=To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
Dialogue#PORTIA=Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
Dialogue#PORTIA=I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Even he that did uphold the very life
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I was enforced to send it after him;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I was beset with shame and courtesy;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=My honour would not let ingratitude
Dialogue#BASSANIO=So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=For, by these blessed candles of the night,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd
Dialogue#BASSANIO=The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
Dialogue#PORTIA=Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
Dialogue#PORTIA=And that which you did swear to keep for me,
Dialogue#PORTIA=I will become as liberal as you;
Dialogue#PORTIA=I'll not deny him any thing I have,
Dialogue#PORTIA=No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
Dialogue#PORTIA=Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
Dialogue#PORTIA=Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
Dialogue#PORTIA=If you do not, if I be left alone,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
Dialogue#PORTIA=I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
Dialogue#NERISSA=And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
Dialogue#NERISSA=How you do leave me to mine own protection.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;
Dialogue#GRATIANO=For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
Dialogue#BASSANIO=And, in the hearing of these many friends,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Wherein I see myself--
Dialogue#PORTIA=Mark you but that!
Dialogue#PORTIA=In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
Dialogue#PORTIA=In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
Dialogue#PORTIA=And there's an oath of credit.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Nay, but hear me:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
Dialogue#BASSANIO=I never more will break an oath with thee.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I once did lend my body for his wealth;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Will never more break faith advisedly.
Dialogue#PORTIA=Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
Dialogue#PORTIA=And bid him keep it better than the other.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
Dialogue#PORTIA=I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
Dialogue#PORTIA=For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
Dialogue#NERISSA=And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
Dialogue#NERISSA=For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
Dialogue#NERISSA=In lieu of this last night did lie with me.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Why, this is like the mending of highways
Dialogue#GRATIANO=In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
Dialogue#GRATIANO=What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?
Dialogue#PORTIA=Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:
Dialogue#PORTIA=Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
Dialogue#PORTIA=It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
Dialogue#PORTIA=There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
Dialogue#PORTIA=Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
Dialogue#PORTIA=Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
Dialogue#PORTIA=And even but now return'd; I have not yet
Dialogue#PORTIA=Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;
Dialogue#PORTIA=And I have better news in store for you
Dialogue#PORTIA=Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
Dialogue#PORTIA=There you shall find three of your argosies
Dialogue#PORTIA=Are richly come to harbour suddenly:
Dialogue#PORTIA=You shall not know by what strange accident
Dialogue#PORTIA=I chanced on this letter.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I am dumb.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Were you the doctor and I knew you not?
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
Dialogue#NERISSA=Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
Dialogue#NERISSA=Unless he live until he be a man.
Dialogue#BASSANIO=Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:
Dialogue#BASSANIO=When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=For here I read for certain that my ships
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Are safely come to road.
Dialogue#PORTIA=How now, Lorenzo!
Dialogue#PORTIA=My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
Dialogue#NERISSA=Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
Dialogue#NERISSA=There do I give to you and Jessica,
Dialogue#NERISSA=From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,

Dialogue#PORTIA=Of these events at full. Let us go in;
Dialogue#PORTIA=And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
Dialogue#PORTIA=And we will answer all things faithfully.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
Dialogue#GRATIANO=That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:
Dialogue#GRATIANO=But were the day come, I should wish it dark,
Dialogue#GRATIANO=That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
Dialogue#GRATIANO=Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
Dialogue#GRATIANO=So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.
