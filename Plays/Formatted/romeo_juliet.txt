Banner#PROLOGUE
Dialogue#LODOVICO=Two households, both alike in dignity,
Dialogue#LODOVICO=In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
Dialogue#LODOVICO=From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Dialogue#LODOVICO=Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
Dialogue#LODOVICO=From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
Dialogue#LODOVICO=A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Dialogue#LODOVICO=Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Dialogue#LODOVICO=Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
Dialogue#LODOVICO=The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
Dialogue#LODOVICO=And the continuance of their parents' rage,
Dialogue#LODOVICO=Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
Dialogue#LODOVICO=Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
Dialogue#LODOVICO=The which if you with patient ears attend,
Dialogue#LODOVICO=What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
Banner#SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
Notice#Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
Dialogue#SAMPSON=Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
Dialogue#GREGORY=No, for then we should be colliers.
Dialogue#SAMPSON=I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
Dialogue#GREGORY=Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
Dialogue#SAMPSON=I strike quickly, being moved.
Dialogue#GREGORY=But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
Dialogue#SAMPSON=A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
Dialogue#GREGORY=To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
Dialogue#GREGORY=therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
Dialogue#SAMPSON=A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
Dialogue#SAMPSON=take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
Dialogue#GREGORY=That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
Dialogue#GREGORY=to the wall.
Dialogue#SAMPSON=True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
Dialogue#SAMPSON=are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
Dialogue#SAMPSON=Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
Dialogue#SAMPSON=to the wall.
Dialogue#GREGORY=The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
Dialogue#SAMPSON='Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
Dialogue#SAMPSON=have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
Dialogue#SAMPSON=maids, and cut off their heads.
Dialogue#GREGORY=The heads of the maids?
Dialogue#SAMPSON=Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
Dialogue#SAMPSON=take it in what sense thou wilt.
Dialogue#GREGORY=They must take it in sense that feel it.
Dialogue#SAMPSON=Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
Dialogue#SAMPSON='tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
Dialogue#GREGORY='Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
Dialogue#GREGORY=hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
Dialogue#GREGORY=two of the house of the Montagues.
Dialogue#SAMPSON=My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
Dialogue#GREGORY=How! turn thy back and run?
Dialogue#SAMPSON=Fear me not.
Dialogue#GREGORY=No, marry; I fear thee!
Dialogue#SAMPSON=Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
Dialogue#GREGORY=I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
Dialogue#GREGORY=they list.
Dialogue#SAMPSON=Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
Dialogue#SAMPSON=which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Notice#Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR
Dialogue#ABRAHAM=Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Dialogue#SAMPSON=I do bite my thumb, sir.
Dialogue#ABRAHAM=Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Dialogue#SAMPSON=[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side, if I say
Dialogue#SAMPSON=ay?
Dialogue#GREGORY=No.
Dialogue#SAMPSON=No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
Dialogue#SAMPSON=bite my thumb, sir.
Dialogue#GREGORY=Do you quarrel, sir?
Dialogue#ABRAHAM=Quarrel sir! no, sir.
Dialogue#SAMPSON=If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
Dialogue#ABRAHAM=No better.
Dialogue#SAMPSON=Well, sir.
Dialogue#GREGORY=Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
Dialogue#SAMPSON=Yes, better, sir.
Dialogue#ABRAHAM=You lie.
Dialogue#SAMPSON=Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
Notice#They fight
Notice#Enter BENVOLIO
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Part, fools!
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
Notice#Beats down their swords
Notice#Enter TYBALT
Dialogue#TYBALT=What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Dialogue#TYBALT=Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Or manage it to part these men with me.
Dialogue#TYBALT=What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
Dialogue#TYBALT=As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Dialogue#TYBALT=Have at thee, coward!
Notice#They fight
Notice#Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs
Dialogue#First Citizen=Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
Dialogue#First Citizen=Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
Notice#Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET
Dialogue#CAPULET=What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
Dialogue#CAPULET=My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
Dialogue#CAPULET=And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
Notice#Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
Dialogue#LADY MONTAGUE=Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
Notice#Enter PRINCE, with Attendants
Dialogue#PRINCE=Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Dialogue#PRINCE=Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
Dialogue#PRINCE=Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
Dialogue#PRINCE=That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
Dialogue#PRINCE=With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
Dialogue#PRINCE=On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Dialogue#PRINCE=Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
Dialogue#PRINCE=And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
Dialogue#PRINCE=Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
Dialogue#PRINCE=By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Dialogue#PRINCE=Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
Dialogue#PRINCE=And made Verona's ancient citizens
Dialogue#PRINCE=Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
Dialogue#PRINCE=To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Dialogue#PRINCE=Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
Dialogue#PRINCE=If ever you disturb our streets again,
Dialogue#PRINCE=Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
Dialogue#PRINCE=For this time, all the rest depart away:
Dialogue#PRINCE=You Capulet; shall go along with me:
Dialogue#PRINCE=And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
Dialogue#PRINCE=To know our further pleasure in this case,
Dialogue#PRINCE=To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
Dialogue#PRINCE=Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
Notice#Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Here were the servants of your adversary,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=I drew to part them: in the instant came
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Came more and more and fought on part and part,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Till the prince came, who parted either part.
Dialogue#LADY MONTAGUE=O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
Dialogue#LADY MONTAGUE=Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=That westward rooteth from the city's side,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=So early walking did I see your son:
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=And stole into the covert of the wood:
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=I, measuring his affections by my own,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=That most are busied when they're most alone,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Many a morning hath he there been seen,
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Should in the furthest east begin to draw
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=And private in his chamber pens himself,
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=And makes himself an artificial night:
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=I neither know it nor can learn of him.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Have you importuned him by any means?
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Both by myself and many other friends:
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=But he, his own affections' counsellor,
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Is to himself--I will not say how true--
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=But to himself so secret and so close,
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=So far from sounding and discovery,
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=We would as willingly give cure as know.
Notice#Enter ROMEO
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
Notice#Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Good-morrow, cousin.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Is the day so young?
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=But new struck nine.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=In love?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Out--
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Of love?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Dialogue#ROMEO=Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Dialogue#ROMEO=Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
Dialogue#ROMEO=O any thing, of nothing first create!
Dialogue#ROMEO=O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Dialogue#ROMEO=Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Dialogue#ROMEO=Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
Dialogue#ROMEO=sick health!
Dialogue#ROMEO=Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
Dialogue#ROMEO=This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Dost thou not laugh?
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=No, coz, I rather weep.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Good heart, at what?
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=At thy good heart's oppression.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Why, such is love's transgression.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
Dialogue#ROMEO=With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Dialogue#ROMEO=Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Dialogue#ROMEO=Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Dialogue#ROMEO=Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
Dialogue#ROMEO=What is it else? a madness most discreet,
Dialogue#ROMEO=A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Farewell, my coz.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=                  Soft! I will go along;
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
Dialogue#ROMEO=This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
Dialogue#ROMEO=What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Groan! why, no.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=But sadly tell me who.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Dialogue#ROMEO=Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
Dialogue#ROMEO=In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Dialogue#ROMEO=A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
Dialogue#ROMEO=With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
Dialogue#ROMEO=And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
Dialogue#ROMEO=From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
Dialogue#ROMEO=She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Dialogue#ROMEO=O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
Dialogue#ROMEO=That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Dialogue#ROMEO=She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
Dialogue#ROMEO=For beauty starved with her severity
Dialogue#ROMEO=Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
Dialogue#ROMEO=She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
Dialogue#ROMEO=To merit bliss by making me despair:
Dialogue#ROMEO=She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Dialogue#ROMEO=Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Dialogue#ROMEO=O, teach me how I should forget to think.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Examine other beauties.
Dialogue#ROMEO='Tis the way
Dialogue#ROMEO=To call hers exquisite, in question more:
Dialogue#ROMEO=These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
Dialogue#ROMEO=Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
Dialogue#ROMEO=He that is strucken blind cannot forget
Dialogue#ROMEO=The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Dialogue#ROMEO=Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
Dialogue#ROMEO=What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Dialogue#ROMEO=Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
Notice#Exeunt
Banner#SCENE II. A street.
Notice#Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant
Dialogue#CAPULET=But Montague is bound as well as I,
Dialogue#CAPULET=In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
Dialogue#CAPULET=For men so old as we to keep the peace.
Dialogue#PARIS=Of honourable reckoning are you both;
Dialogue#PARIS=And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
Dialogue#PARIS=But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
Dialogue#CAPULET=But saying o'er what I have said before:
Dialogue#CAPULET=My child is yet a stranger in the world;
Dialogue#CAPULET=She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
Dialogue#CAPULET=Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Dialogue#CAPULET=Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
Dialogue#PARIS=Younger than she are happy mothers made.
Dialogue#CAPULET=And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
Dialogue#CAPULET=The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
Dialogue#CAPULET=She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
Dialogue#CAPULET=But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
Dialogue#CAPULET=My will to her consent is but a part;
Dialogue#CAPULET=An she agree, within her scope of choice
Dialogue#CAPULET=Lies my consent and fair according voice.
Dialogue#CAPULET=This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
Dialogue#CAPULET=Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Dialogue#CAPULET=Such as I love; and you, among the store,
Dialogue#CAPULET=One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
Dialogue#CAPULET=At my poor house look to behold this night
Dialogue#CAPULET=Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Dialogue#CAPULET=Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
Dialogue#CAPULET=When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Dialogue#CAPULET=Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Dialogue#CAPULET=Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Dialogue#CAPULET=Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
Dialogue#CAPULET=And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Dialogue#CAPULET=Which on more view, of many mine being one
Dialogue#CAPULET=May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
Dialogue#CAPULET=Come, go with me.
Notice#To Servant, giving a paper
Dialogue#CAPULET=Go, sirrah, trudge about
Dialogue#CAPULET=Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Dialogue#CAPULET=Whose names are written there, and to them say,
Dialogue#CAPULET=My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
Notice#Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
Dialogue#Servant=Find them out whose names are written here! It is
Dialogue#Servant=written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
Dialogue#Servant=yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
Dialogue#Servant=his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
Dialogue#Servant=sent to find those persons whose names are here
Dialogue#Servant=writ, and can never find what names the writing
Dialogue#Servant=person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
Notice#Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=And the rank poison of the old will die.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=For what, I pray thee?
Dialogue#ROMEO=For your broken shin.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
Dialogue#ROMEO=Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
Dialogue#Servant=God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
Dialogue#Servant=Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
Dialogue#Servant=pray, can you read any thing you see?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
Dialogue#Servant=Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
Dialogue#ROMEO=Stay, fellow; I can read.

Dialogue#ROMEO=Whose house?
Dialogue#Servant=My master's.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
Dialogue#Servant=Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
Dialogue#Servant=great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
Dialogue#Servant=of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
Dialogue#Servant=Rest you merry!

Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Compare her face with some that I shall show,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
Dialogue#ROMEO=When the devout religion of mine eye
Dialogue#ROMEO=Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
Dialogue#ROMEO=And these, who often drown'd could never die,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
Dialogue#ROMEO=One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
Dialogue#ROMEO=Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,

Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Your lady's love against some other maid
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=That I will show you shining at this feast,

Dialogue#Nurse=God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
Notice#Enter JULIET
Dialogue#JULIET=How now! who calls?
Dialogue#Nurse=Your mother.
Dialogue#JULIET=Madam, I am here.
Dialogue#JULIET=What is your will?
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Dialogue#Nurse=Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=She's not fourteen.
Dialogue#Nurse=I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
Dialogue#Nurse=And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
Dialogue#Nurse=She is not fourteen. How long is it now
Dialogue#Nurse=To Lammas-tide?
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=                  A fortnight and odd days.
Dialogue#Nurse=Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Dialogue#Nurse=Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Dialogue#Nurse=Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
Dialogue#Nurse=Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
Dialogue#Nurse=She was too good for me: but, as I said,
Dialogue#Nurse=On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
Dialogue#Nurse=That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
Dialogue#Nurse='Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
Dialogue#Nurse=And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
Dialogue#Nurse=Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
Dialogue#Nurse=For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Dialogue#Nurse=Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
Dialogue#Nurse=My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
Dialogue#Nurse=Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
Dialogue#Nurse=When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Dialogue#Nurse=Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
Dialogue#Nurse=To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
Dialogue#Nurse=Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
Dialogue#Nurse=To bid me trudge:
Dialogue#Nurse=And since that time it is eleven years;
Dialogue#Nurse=For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
Dialogue#Nurse=She could have run and waddled all about;
Dialogue#Nurse=For even the day before, she broke her brow:
Dialogue#Nurse=And then my husband--God be with his soul!
Dialogue#Nurse=A' was a merry man--took up the child:
Dialogue#Nurse='Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Dialogue#Nurse=Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Dialogue#Nurse=Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
Dialogue#Nurse=The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
Dialogue#Nurse=To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
Dialogue#Nurse=I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
Dialogue#Nurse=I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
Dialogue#Nurse=And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
Dialogue#Nurse=Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
Dialogue#Nurse=To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
Dialogue#Nurse=And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
Dialogue#Nurse=A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
Dialogue#Nurse=A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
Dialogue#Nurse='Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
Dialogue#Nurse=Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Dialogue#Nurse=Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
Dialogue#JULIET=And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
Dialogue#Nurse=Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Dialogue#Nurse=Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
Dialogue#Nurse=An I might live to see thee married once,
Dialogue#Nurse=I have my wish.
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=How stands your disposition to be married?
Dialogue#JULIET=It is an honour that I dream not of.
Dialogue#Nurse=An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
Dialogue#Nurse=I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Are made already mothers: by my count,
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=I was your mother much upon these years
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Dialogue#Nurse=A man, young lady! lady, such a man
Dialogue#Nurse=As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Dialogue#Nurse=Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=What say you? can you love the gentleman?
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Examine every married lineament,
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=And see how one another lends content
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=And what obscured in this fair volume lies
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Find written in the margent of his eyes.

Dialogue#ROMEO=What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Or shall we on without a apology?
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=The date is out of such prolixity:
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=After the prompter, for our entrance:
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=But let them measure us by what they will;
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Dialogue#ROMEO=Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
Dialogue#ROMEO=With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Dialogue#ROMEO=So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=And soar with them above a common bound.
Dialogue#ROMEO=I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
Dialogue#ROMEO=To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
Dialogue#ROMEO=I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Dialogue#ROMEO=Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Give me a case to put my visage in:
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=A visor for a visor! what care I
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=But every man betake him to his legs.
Dialogue#ROMEO=A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
Dialogue#ROMEO=Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
Dialogue#ROMEO=For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
Dialogue#ROMEO=I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
Dialogue#ROMEO=The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
Dialogue#ROMEO=Nay, that's not so.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=I mean, sir, in delay
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
Dialogue#ROMEO=And we mean well in going to this mask;
Dialogue#ROMEO=But 'tis no wit to go.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Why, may one ask?
Dialogue#ROMEO=I dream'd a dream to-night.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=And so did I.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Well, what was yours?
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=That dreamers often lie.
Dialogue#ROMEO=In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Drawn with a team of little atomies
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=The traces of the smallest spider's web,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Not so big as a round little worm
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=And in this state she gallops night by night
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Then dreams, he of another benefice:
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=That plats the manes of horses in the night,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=That presses them and learns them first to bear,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Making them women of good carriage:
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=This is she--
Dialogue#ROMEO=                  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Dialogue#ROMEO=Thou talk'st of nothing.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=True, I talk of dreams,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Which are the children of an idle brain,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Which is as thin of substance as the air
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Dialogue#ROMEO=I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
Dialogue#ROMEO=Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Dialogue#ROMEO=Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
Dialogue#ROMEO=With this night's revels and expire the term
Dialogue#ROMEO=Of a despised life closed in my breast
Dialogue#ROMEO=By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
Dialogue#ROMEO=But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.

Dialogue#ROMEO=She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?

Dialogue#ROMEO=Having some business, do entreat her eyes
Dialogue#ROMEO=To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
Dialogue#ROMEO=What if her eyes were there, they in her head?

Dialogue#ROMEO=By a name
Dialogue#ROMEO=I know not how to tell thee who I am:
Dialogue#ROMEO=My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Because it is an enemy to thee;
Dialogue#ROMEO=Had I it written, I would tear the word.
Dialogue#JULIET=My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Dialogue#JULIET=Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Dialogue#JULIET=Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
Dialogue#JULIET=How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
Dialogue#JULIET=The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
Dialogue#JULIET=And the place death, considering who thou art,
Dialogue#JULIET=If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
Dialogue#ROMEO=With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
Dialogue#ROMEO=For stony limits cannot hold love out,
Dialogue#ROMEO=And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Dialogue#ROMEO=Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
Dialogue#JULIET=If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Dialogue#ROMEO=Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
Dialogue#ROMEO=And I am proof against their enmity.
Dialogue#JULIET=I would not for the world they saw thee here.
Dialogue#ROMEO=I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
Dialogue#ROMEO=And but thou love me, let them find me here:
Dialogue#ROMEO=My life were better ended by their hate,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Dialogue#JULIET=By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
Dialogue#ROMEO=By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
Dialogue#ROMEO=He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
Dialogue#ROMEO=I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far

Dialogue#JULIET=Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Dialogue#JULIET=Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
Dialogue#JULIET=If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Dialogue#JULIET=Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
Dialogue#JULIET=I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
Dialogue#JULIET=So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
Dialogue#JULIET=In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
Dialogue#JULIET=And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:

Dialogue#JULIET=That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Dialogue#JULIET=Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Dialogue#ROMEO=What shall I swear by?
Dialogue#JULIET=Do not swear at all;
Dialogue#JULIET=Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Dialogue#JULIET=Which is the god of my idolatry,
Dialogue#JULIET=And I'll believe thee.
Dialogue#ROMEO=If my heart's dear love--
Dialogue#JULIET=Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,

Dialogue#ROMEO=O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Dialogue#JULIET=What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Dialogue#ROMEO=The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Dialogue#JULIET=I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
Dialogue#JULIET=And yet I would it were to give again.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
Dialogue#JULIET=But to be frank, and give it thee again.
Dialogue#JULIET=And yet I wish but for the thing I have:

Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=encounter Tybalt?
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Why, what is Tybalt?
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk

Dialogue#ROMEO=Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=was I with you there for the goose?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast

Dialogue#MERCUTIO=inch narrow to an ell broad!
Dialogue#ROMEO=I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
Dialogue#ROMEO=to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:

Dialogue#Nurse=a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
Dialogue#Nurse=kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
Dialogue#Nurse=is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double

Dialogue#Nurse=Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Dialogue#JULIET=How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
Dialogue#JULIET=To say to me that thou art out of breath?
Dialogue#JULIET=The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Dialogue#JULIET=Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Dialogue#JULIET=Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Dialogue#JULIET=Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
Dialogue#JULIET=Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
Dialogue#Nurse=Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
Dialogue#Nurse=how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
Dialogue#Nurse=face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
Dialogue#Nurse=all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Dialogue#Nurse=though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
Dialogue#Nurse=past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,

Dialogue#Nurse=Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!

Dialogue#Nurse=To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
Dialogue#JULIET=I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Dialogue#JULIET=Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Dialogue#Nurse=Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
Dialogue#Nurse=courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
Dialogue#Nurse=warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Dialogue#JULIET=Where is my mother! why, she is within;
Dialogue#JULIET=Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
Dialogue#JULIET='Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Dialogue#JULIET=Where is your mother?'
Dialogue#Nurse=O God's lady dear!
Dialogue#Nurse=Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
Dialogue#Nurse=Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Dialogue#Nurse=Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Dialogue#JULIET=Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
Dialogue#Nurse=Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
Dialogue#JULIET=I have.
Dialogue#Nurse=Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
Dialogue#Nurse=There stays a husband to make you a wife:
Dialogue#Nurse=Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
Dialogue#Nurse=They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Dialogue#Nurse=Hie you to church; I must another way,
Dialogue#Nurse=To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
Dialogue#Nurse=Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
Dialogue#Nurse=I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
Dialogue#Nurse=But you shall bear the burden soon at night.

Dialogue#ROMEO=That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Dialogue#ROMEO=Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
Dialogue#ROMEO=It is enough I may but call her mine.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=These violent delights have violent ends
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Is loathsome in his own deliciousness

Dialogue#ROMEO=Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Dialogue#ROMEO=Receive in either by this dear encounter.
Dialogue#JULIET=Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Dialogue#JULIET=Brags of his substance, not of ornament:

Dialogue#JULIET=I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

Dialogue#MERCUTIO=upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws

Dialogue#MERCUTIO=soon moody to be moved.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=And what to?
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=man for coughing in the street, because he hath
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
Dialogue#MERCUTIO=his new doublet before Easter? with another, for

Dialogue#MERCUTIO=wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

Dialogue#MERCUTIO=Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
Dialogue#TYBALT=Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
Dialogue#TYBALT=No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Dialogue#ROMEO=Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
Dialogue#ROMEO=To such a greeting: villain am I none;
Dialogue#ROMEO=Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
Dialogue#TYBALT=Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
Dialogue#TYBALT=That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
Dialogue#ROMEO=I do protest, I never injured thee,

Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=O cousin, cousin!
Dialogue#PRINCE=Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Your high displeasure: all this uttered
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Cold death aside, and with the other sends
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO='Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=his tongue,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
Dialogue#BENVOLIO=This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=And all those twenty could but kill one life.
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
Dialogue#PRINCE=Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
Dialogue#PRINCE=Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=His fault concludes but what the law should end,
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=The life of Tybalt.
Dialogue#PRINCE=And for that offence
Dialogue#PRINCE=Immediately we do exile him hence:
Dialogue#PRINCE=I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
Dialogue#PRINCE=My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
Dialogue#PRINCE=But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
Dialogue#PRINCE=That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
Dialogue#PRINCE=I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Dialogue#PRINCE=Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
Dialogue#PRINCE=Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
Dialogue#PRINCE=Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
Dialogue#PRINCE=Bear hence this body and attend our will:
Dialogue#PRINCE=Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

Dialogue#JULIET=Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
Dialogue#JULIET=By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,

Dialogue#JULIET=Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,

Dialogue#JULIET=Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Dialogue#JULIET=Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,

Dialogue#JULIET=And he will make the face of heaven so fine
Dialogue#JULIET=That all the world will be in love with night
Dialogue#JULIET=And pay no worship to the garish sun.
Dialogue#JULIET=O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
Dialogue#JULIET=But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Dialogue#JULIET=Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
Dialogue#JULIET=As is the night before some festival

Dialogue#Nurse=Romeo can,
Dialogue#Nurse=Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
Dialogue#Nurse=Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
Dialogue#JULIET=What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
Dialogue#JULIET=This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
Dialogue#JULIET=Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
Dialogue#JULIET=And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Dialogue#JULIET=Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
Dialogue#JULIET=I am not I, if there be such an I;
Dialogue#JULIET=Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
Dialogue#JULIET=If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
Dialogue#JULIET=Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
Dialogue#Nurse=I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
Dialogue#Nurse=God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
Dialogue#Nurse=A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Dialogue#Nurse=Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
Dialogue#Nurse=All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
Dialogue#JULIET=O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
Dialogue#JULIET=To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Dialogue#JULIET=Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
Dialogue#JULIET=And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
Dialogue#Nurse=O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
Dialogue#Nurse=O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
Dialogue#Nurse=That ever I should live to see thee dead!
Dialogue#JULIET=What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Dialogue#JULIET=Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
Dialogue#JULIET=My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
Dialogue#JULIET=Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
Dialogue#JULIET=For who is living, if those two are gone?
Dialogue#Nurse=Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;

Dialogue#Nurse=These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Dialogue#Nurse=Shame come to Romeo!
Dialogue#JULIET=Blister'd be thy tongue
Dialogue#JULIET=For such a wish! he was not born to shame:

Dialogue#JULIET=Sole monarch of the universal earth.
Dialogue#JULIET=O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

Dialogue#JULIET=Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
Dialogue#JULIET=When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
Dialogue#JULIET=But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
Dialogue#JULIET=That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
Dialogue#JULIET=Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;

Dialogue#JULIET=Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
Dialogue#JULIET=My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
Dialogue#JULIET=And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
Dialogue#JULIET=All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Dialogue#JULIET=Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
Dialogue#JULIET=That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
Dialogue#JULIET=But, O, it presses to my memory,
Dialogue#JULIET=Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
Dialogue#JULIET='Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
Dialogue#JULIET=That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
Dialogue#JULIET=Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Dialogue#JULIET=Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Dialogue#JULIET=Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
Dialogue#JULIET=And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Dialogue#JULIET=Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Dialogue#JULIET=Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Dialogue#JULIET=Which modern lamentations might have moved?
Dialogue#JULIET=But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
Dialogue#JULIET='Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,

Dialogue#Nurse=Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
Dialogue#JULIET=Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
Dialogue#JULIET=When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
Dialogue#JULIET=Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Dialogue#JULIET=Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:

Dialogue#JULIET=But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Dialogue#JULIET=Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
Dialogue#JULIET=And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
Dialogue#Nurse=Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo

Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And thou art wedded to calamity.
Notice#Enter ROMEO
Dialogue#ROMEO=Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
Dialogue#ROMEO=What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
Dialogue#ROMEO=That I yet know not?
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Too familiar
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Is my dear son with such sour company:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
Dialogue#ROMEO=What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Not body's death, but body's banishment.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
Dialogue#ROMEO=For exile hath more terror in his look,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Hence from Verona art thou banished:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Dialogue#ROMEO=There is no world without Verona walls,
Dialogue#ROMEO=But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
Dialogue#ROMEO=And world's exile is death: then banished,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
Dialogue#ROMEO=And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
Dialogue#ROMEO='Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
Dialogue#ROMEO=And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Live here in heaven and may look on her;
Dialogue#ROMEO=But Romeo may not: more validity,
Dialogue#ROMEO=More honourable state, more courtship lives
Dialogue#ROMEO=In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
Dialogue#ROMEO=On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
Dialogue#ROMEO=And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
Dialogue#ROMEO=But Romeo may not; he is banished:
Dialogue#ROMEO=Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
Dialogue#ROMEO=They are free men, but I am banished.
Dialogue#ROMEO=And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
Dialogue#ROMEO=No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
Dialogue#ROMEO=But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
Dialogue#ROMEO=O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
Dialogue#ROMEO=Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
Dialogue#ROMEO=A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
Dialogue#ROMEO=To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
Dialogue#ROMEO=O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Dialogue#ROMEO=Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
Dialogue#ROMEO=It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
Dialogue#ROMEO=How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
Dialogue#ROMEO=Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
Dialogue#ROMEO=An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Doting like me and like me banished,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
Dialogue#ROMEO=And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
Notice#Knocking within

Dialogue#Nurse=Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
Dialogue#Nurse=O, he is even in my mistress' case,
Dialogue#Nurse=Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
Dialogue#Nurse=Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Dialogue#Nurse=Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Dialogue#Nurse=Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
Dialogue#Nurse=For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
Dialogue#Nurse=Why should you fall into so deep an O?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Nurse!
Dialogue#Nurse=Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Doth she not think me an old murderer,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
Dialogue#ROMEO=With blood removed but little from her own?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
Dialogue#ROMEO=My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
Dialogue#Nurse=O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
Dialogue#Nurse=And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
Dialogue#Nurse=And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
Dialogue#Nurse=And then down falls again.
Dialogue#ROMEO=As if that name,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
Dialogue#ROMEO=Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
Dialogue#ROMEO=In what vile part of this anatomy
Dialogue#ROMEO=Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
Dialogue#ROMEO=The hateful mansion.
Notice#Drawing his sword
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Hold thy desperate hand:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=The unreasonable fury of a beast:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And usest none in that true use indeed
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Digressing from the valour of a man;
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Happiness courts thee in her best array;
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Romeo is coming.
Dialogue#Nurse=O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
Dialogue#Nurse=To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
Dialogue#Nurse=My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Either be gone before the watch be set,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And he shall signify from time to time
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Every good hap to you that chances here:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.

Dialogue#CAPULET=And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
Dialogue#CAPULET='Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:

Dialogue#CAPULET=Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender

Dialogue#CAPULET=O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
Dialogue#CAPULET=She shall be married to this noble earl.
Dialogue#CAPULET=Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
Dialogue#CAPULET=We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
Dialogue#CAPULET=For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
Dialogue#CAPULET=It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Dialogue#CAPULET=Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
Dialogue#CAPULET=Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,

Dialogue#JULIET=That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Dialogue#JULIET=Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
Dialogue#JULIET=Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
Dialogue#ROMEO=It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
Dialogue#ROMEO=No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
Dialogue#ROMEO=Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
Dialogue#ROMEO=Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Dialogue#ROMEO=Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
Dialogue#ROMEO=I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Dialogue#JULIET=Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
Dialogue#JULIET=It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
Dialogue#JULIET=To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
Dialogue#JULIET=And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
Dialogue#JULIET=Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
Dialogue#ROMEO=I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
Dialogue#ROMEO=I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
Dialogue#ROMEO='Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
Dialogue#ROMEO=Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
Dialogue#ROMEO=The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:

Dialogue#ROMEO=Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
Dialogue#ROMEO=How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
Dialogue#JULIET=It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
Dialogue#JULIET=It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Dialogue#JULIET=Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Dialogue#JULIET=Some say the lark makes sweet division;
Dialogue#JULIET=This doth not so, for she divideth us:
Dialogue#JULIET=Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
Dialogue#JULIET=O, now I would they had changed voices too!
Dialogue#JULIET=Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Dialogue#JULIET=Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,

Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
Dialogue#JULIET=Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Which you weep for.
Dialogue#JULIET=Feeling so the loss,
Dialogue#JULIET=Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
Dialogue#LADY CAPULET=Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,

Dialogue#JULIET=[Aside]  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
Dialogue#JULIET=God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;

Dialogue#JULIET=He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
Dialogue#JULIET=I wonder at this haste; that I must wed

Dialogue#JULIET=I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
Dialogue#JULIET=I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
Dialogue#JULIET=It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,

Dialogue#Nurse=Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Dialogue#Nurse=Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
Dialogue#Nurse=I think it best you married with the county.
Dialogue#Nurse=O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Dialogue#Nurse=Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Dialogue#Nurse=Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
Dialogue#Nurse=As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
Dialogue#Nurse=I think you are happy in this second match,
Dialogue#Nurse=For it excels your first: or if it did not,

Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
Dialogue#PARIS=My father Capulet will have it so;
Dialogue#PARIS=And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=You say you do not know the lady's mind:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Uneven is the course, I like it not.
Dialogue#PARIS=Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
Dialogue#PARIS=And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
Dialogue#PARIS=For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Dialogue#PARIS=Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
Dialogue#PARIS=That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
Dialogue#PARIS=And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
Dialogue#PARIS=To stop the inundation of her tears;
Dialogue#PARIS=Which, too much minded by herself alone,
Dialogue#PARIS=May be put from her by society:
Dialogue#PARIS=Now do you know the reason of this haste.

Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=That's a certain text.
Dialogue#PARIS=Come you to make confession to this father?
Dialogue#JULIET=To answer that, I should confess to you.
Dialogue#PARIS=Do not deny to him that you love me.
Dialogue#JULIET=I will confess to you that I love him.
Dialogue#PARIS=So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
Dialogue#JULIET=If I do so, it will be of more price,
Dialogue#JULIET=Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
Dialogue#PARIS=Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
Dialogue#JULIET=The tears have got small victory by that;
Dialogue#JULIET=For it was bad enough before their spite.
Dialogue#PARIS=Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
Dialogue#JULIET=That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
Dialogue#JULIET=And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
Dialogue#PARIS=Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
Dialogue#JULIET=It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Dialogue#JULIET=Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Dialogue#JULIET=Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
Dialogue#PARIS=God shield I should disturb devotion!
Dialogue#PARIS=Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
Dialogue#PARIS=Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#JULIET=O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
Dialogue#JULIET=Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=It strains me past the compass of my wits:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=On Thursday next be married to this county.
Dialogue#JULIET=Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Dialogue#JULIET=Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
Dialogue#JULIET=If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Dialogue#JULIET=Do thou but call my resolution wise,
Dialogue#JULIET=And with this knife I'll help it presently.
Dialogue#JULIET=God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
Dialogue#JULIET=And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Dialogue#JULIET=Shall be the label to another deed,
Dialogue#JULIET=Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Dialogue#JULIET=Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
Dialogue#JULIET=Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
Dialogue#JULIET=Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
Dialogue#JULIET='Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Dialogue#JULIET=Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
Dialogue#JULIET=Which the commission of thy years and art
Dialogue#JULIET=Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Dialogue#JULIET=Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
Dialogue#JULIET=If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Which craves as desperate an execution.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=As that is desperate which we would prevent.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=If, rather than to marry County Paris,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=A thing like death to chide away this shame,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=That copest with death himself to scape from it:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
Dialogue#JULIET=O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
Dialogue#JULIET=From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Dialogue#JULIET=Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Dialogue#JULIET=Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Dialogue#JULIET=Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
Dialogue#JULIET=O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
Dialogue#JULIET=With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
Dialogue#JULIET=Or bid me go into a new-made grave
Dialogue#JULIET=And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Dialogue#JULIET=Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
Dialogue#JULIET=And I will do it without fear or doubt,
Dialogue#JULIET=To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=When presently through all thy veins shall run
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Each part, deprived of supple government,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Then, as the manner of our country is,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And hither shall he come: and he and I
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=And this shall free thee from this present shame;
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Abate thy valour in the acting it.
Dialogue#JULIET=Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
Dialogue#FRIAR LAURENCE=To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

Dialogue#ROMEO=My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
Dialogue#ROMEO=My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
Dialogue#ROMEO=And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
Dialogue#ROMEO=Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
Dialogue#ROMEO=I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
Dialogue#ROMEO=Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
Dialogue#ROMEO=to think!--
Dialogue#ROMEO=And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
Dialogue#ROMEO=That I revived, and was an emperor.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
Dialogue#ROMEO=When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!

Dialogue#ROMEO=Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
Dialogue#ROMEO=How doth my lady? Is my father well?
Dialogue#ROMEO=How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
Dialogue#ROMEO=For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
Dialogue#BALTHASAR=Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
Dialogue#BALTHASAR=Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
Dialogue#BALTHASAR=And her immortal part with angels lives.
Dialogue#BALTHASAR=I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
Dialogue#BALTHASAR=And presently took post to tell it you:
Dialogue#BALTHASAR=O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Dialogue#BALTHASAR=Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Dialogue#ROMEO=Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
Dialogue#ROMEO=And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
Dialogue#BALTHASAR=I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
Dialogue#BALTHASAR=Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
Dialogue#BALTHASAR=Some misadventure.
Dialogue#ROMEO=                  Tush, thou art deceived:
Dialogue#ROMEO=Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
Dialogue#BALTHASAR=No, my good lord.

Notice#Exit BALTHASAR
Dialogue#ROMEO=Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
Dialogue#ROMEO=To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
Dialogue#ROMEO=I do remember an apothecary,--
Dialogue#ROMEO=And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
Dialogue#ROMEO=In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
Dialogue#ROMEO=And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
Dialogue#ROMEO=An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
Dialogue#ROMEO=Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
Dialogue#ROMEO=A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Noting this penury, to myself I said
Dialogue#ROMEO='An if a man did need a poison now,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
Dialogue#ROMEO=O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
Dialogue#ROMEO=And this same needy man must sell it me.
Dialogue#ROMEO=As I remember, this should be the house.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
Dialogue#ROMEO=What, ho! apothecary!

Dialogue#Apothecary=Who calls so loud?
Dialogue#ROMEO=Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
Dialogue#ROMEO=Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
Dialogue#ROMEO=A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
Dialogue#ROMEO=As will disperse itself through all the veins
Dialogue#ROMEO=That the life-weary taker may fall dead
Dialogue#ROMEO=And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
Dialogue#ROMEO=As violently as hasty powder fired
Dialogue#ROMEO=Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
Dialogue#Apothecary=Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Dialogue#Apothecary=Is death to any he that utters them.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
Dialogue#ROMEO=And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
Dialogue#ROMEO=The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
Dialogue#ROMEO=The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Dialogue#ROMEO=Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Dialogue#Apothecary=My poverty, but not my will, consents.
Dialogue#ROMEO=I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Dialogue#Apothecary=Put this in any liquid thing you will,
Dialogue#Apothecary=And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
Dialogue#Apothecary=Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
Dialogue#ROMEO=There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
Dialogue#ROMEO=I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
Dialogue#ROMEO=To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

Dialogue#ROMEO=Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
Dialogue#ROMEO=And do not interrupt me in my course.
Dialogue#ROMEO=Why I descend into this bed of death,
Dialogue#ROMEO=Is partly to behold my lady's face;
Dialogue#ROMEO=But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
Dialogue#ROMEO=A precious ring, a ring that I must use
Dialogue#ROMEO=In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:

Dialogue#ROMEO=In what I further shall intend to do,

Dialogue#PRINCE=Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
Dialogue#PAGE=He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
Dialogue#PAGE=And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
Dialogue#PAGE=Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
Dialogue#PAGE=And by and by my master drew on him;
Dialogue#PAGE=And then I ran away to call the watch.
Dialogue#PRINCE=This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Dialogue#PRINCE=Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
Dialogue#PRINCE=And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Dialogue#PRINCE=Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Dialogue#PRINCE=Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Dialogue#PRINCE=Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
Dialogue#PRINCE=See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
Dialogue#PRINCE=That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
Dialogue#PRINCE=And I for winking at your discords too
Dialogue#PRINCE=Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
Dialogue#CAPULET=O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
Dialogue#CAPULET=This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
Dialogue#CAPULET=Can I demand.
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=                  But I can give thee more:
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=That while Verona by that name is known,
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=There shall no figure at such rate be set
Dialogue#MONTAGUE=As that of true and faithful Juliet.
Dialogue#CAPULET=As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Dialogue#CAPULET=Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
Dialogue#PRINCE=A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
Dialogue#PRINCE=The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
Dialogue#PRINCE=Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Dialogue#PRINCE=Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
Dialogue#PRINCE=For never was a story of more woe
Dialogue#PRINCE=Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
