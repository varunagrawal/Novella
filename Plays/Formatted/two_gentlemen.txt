Notice#Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Were't not affection chains thy tender days
Dialogue#VALENTINE=To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=I rather would entreat thy company
Dialogue#VALENTINE=To see the wonders of the world abroad,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Even as I would when I to love begin.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Wish me partaker in thy happiness
Dialogue#PROTEUS=When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=If ever danger do environ thee,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=And on a love-book pray for my success?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=That's on some shallow story of deep love:
Dialogue#VALENTINE=How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=That's a deep story of a deeper love:
Dialogue#PROTEUS=For he was more than over shoes in love.
Dialogue#VALENTINE='Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=What?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
Dialogue#VALENTINE=With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
Dialogue#VALENTINE=If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=However, but a folly bought with wit,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
Dialogue#PROTEUS='Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Love is your master, for he masters you:
Dialogue#VALENTINE=And he that is so yoked by a fool,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
Dialogue#PROTEUS=The eating canker dwells, so eating love
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=And writers say, as the most forward bud
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Even so by love the young and tender wit
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Losing his verdure even in the prime
Dialogue#VALENTINE=And all the fair effects of future hopes.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=That art a votary to fond desire?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Once more adieu! my father at the road
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Of thy success in love, and what news else
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=And likewise will visit thee with mine.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
Dialogue#VALENTINE=As much to you at home! and so, farewell.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#PROTEUS=He after honour hunts, I after love:
Dialogue#PROTEUS=He leaves his friends to dignify them more,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
Notice#Enter SPEED
Dialogue#SPEED=Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.
Dialogue#SPEED=Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
Dialogue#SPEED=And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=An if the shepherd be a while away.
Dialogue#SPEED=You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,
Dialogue#SPEED=and I a sheep?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=I do.
Dialogue#SPEED=Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.
Dialogue#SPEED=This proves me still a sheep.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=True; and thy master a shepherd.
Dialogue#SPEED=Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
Dialogue#SPEED=The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
Dialogue#SPEED=shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks
Dialogue#SPEED=not me: therefore I am no sheep.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the
Dialogue#PROTEUS=shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
Dialogue#PROTEUS=wages followest thy master; thy master for wages
Dialogue#PROTEUS=follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
Dialogue#SPEED=Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
Dialogue#PROTEUS=But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?
Dialogue#SPEED=Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,
Dialogue#SPEED=a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a
Dialogue#SPEED=lost mutton, nothing for my labour.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
Dialogue#SPEED=If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.
Dialogue#SPEED=Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
Dialogue#SPEED=carrying your letter.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.
Dialogue#SPEED=From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
Dialogue#SPEED='Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
Dialogue#SPEED=your lover.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=But what said she?
Dialogue#SPEED=[First nodding]  Ay.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.
Dialogue#SPEED=You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask
Dialogue#SPEED=me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And that set together is noddy.
Dialogue#SPEED=Now you have taken the pains to set it together,
Dialogue#SPEED=take it for your pains.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
Dialogue#SPEED=Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Why sir, how do you bear with me?
Dialogue#SPEED=Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing
Dialogue#SPEED=but the word 'noddy' for my pains.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
Dialogue#SPEED=And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?
Dialogue#SPEED=Open your purse, that the money and the matter may
Dialogue#SPEED=be both at once delivered.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
Dialogue#SPEED=Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
Dialogue#SPEED=Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,
Dialogue#SPEED=not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
Dialogue#SPEED=and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I
Dialogue#SPEED=fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
Dialogue#SPEED=mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as
Dialogue#SPEED=hard as steel.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=What said she? nothing?
Dialogue#SPEED=No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To
Dialogue#SPEED=testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned
Dialogue#SPEED=me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your
Dialogue#SPEED=letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Being destined to a drier death on shore.
Notice#Exit SPEED
Dialogue#PROTEUS=I must go send some better messenger:
Dialogue#PROTEUS=I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Receiving them from such a worthless post.

Notice#Enter JULlA and LUCETTA
Dialogue#JULIA=But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
Dialogue#JULIA=Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.
Dialogue#JULIA=Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
Dialogue#JULIA=That every day with parle encounter me,
Dialogue#JULIA=In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
Dialogue#LUCETTA=According to my shallow simple skill.
Dialogue#JULIA=What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;
Dialogue#LUCETTA=But, were I you, he never should be mine.
Dialogue#JULIA=What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
Dialogue#JULIA=What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
Dialogue#JULIA=How now! what means this passion at his name?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame
Dialogue#LUCETTA=That I, unworthy body as I am,
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
Dialogue#JULIA=Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Then thus: of many good I think him best.
Dialogue#JULIA=Your reason?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=I have no other, but a woman's reason;
Dialogue#LUCETTA=I think him so because I think him so.
Dialogue#JULIA=And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
Dialogue#JULIA=Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
Dialogue#JULIA=His little speaking shows his love but small.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
Dialogue#JULIA=They do not love that do not show their love.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=O, they love least that let men know their love.
Dialogue#JULIA=I would I knew his mind.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Peruse this paper, madam.
Dialogue#JULIA='To Julia.' Say, from whom?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=That the contents will show.
Dialogue#JULIA=Say, say, who gave it thee?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Did in your name receive it: pardon the
Dialogue#LUCETTA=fault I pray.
Dialogue#JULIA=Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
Dialogue#JULIA=Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
Dialogue#JULIA=To whisper and conspire against my youth?
Dialogue#JULIA=Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
Dialogue#JULIA=And you an officer fit for the place.
Dialogue#JULIA=Or else return no more into my sight.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
Dialogue#JULIA=Will ye be gone?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=                  That you may ruminate.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#JULIA=And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter:
Dialogue#JULIA=It were a shame to call her back again
Dialogue#JULIA=And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
Dialogue#JULIA=What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
Dialogue#JULIA=And would not force the letter to my view!
Dialogue#JULIA=Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that
Dialogue#JULIA=Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
Dialogue#JULIA=Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
Dialogue#JULIA=That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
Dialogue#JULIA=And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
Dialogue#JULIA=How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
Dialogue#JULIA=When willingly I would have had her here!
Dialogue#JULIA=How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
Dialogue#JULIA=When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
Dialogue#JULIA=My penance is to call Lucetta back
Dialogue#JULIA=And ask remission for my folly past.
Dialogue#JULIA=What ho! Lucetta!
Notice#Re-enter LUCETTA
Dialogue#LUCETTA=                  What would your ladyship?
Dialogue#JULIA=Is't near dinner-time?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=I would it were,
Dialogue#LUCETTA=That you might kill your stomach on your meat
Dialogue#LUCETTA=And not upon your maid.
Dialogue#JULIA=What is't that you took up so gingerly?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Nothing.
Dialogue#JULIA=Why didst thou stoop, then?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=To take a paper up that I let fall.
Dialogue#JULIA=And is that paper nothing?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Nothing concerning me.
Dialogue#JULIA=Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Unless it have a false interpeter.
Dialogue#JULIA=Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
Dialogue#JULIA=As little by such toys as may be possible.
Dialogue#JULIA=Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'
Dialogue#LUCETTA=It is too heavy for so light a tune.
Dialogue#JULIA=Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.
Dialogue#JULIA=And why not you?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=                  I cannot reach so high.
Dialogue#JULIA=Let's see your song. How now, minion!
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
Dialogue#LUCETTA=And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
Dialogue#JULIA=You do not?
Dialogue#LUCETTA=          No, madam; it is too sharp.
Dialogue#JULIA=You, minion, are too saucy.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Nay, now you are too flat
Dialogue#LUCETTA=And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
Dialogue#LUCETTA=There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
Dialogue#JULIA=The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
Dialogue#JULIA=This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
Dialogue#JULIA=Here is a coil with protestation!
Notice#Tears the letter
Dialogue#JULIA=Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:
Dialogue#JULIA=You would be fingering them, to anger me.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
Dialogue#LUCETTA=To be so anger'd with another letter.
Notice#Exit
Dialogue#JULIA= Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
Dialogue#JULIA=O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
Dialogue#JULIA=Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
Dialogue#JULIA=And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
Dialogue#JULIA=I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
Dialogue#JULIA=Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!
Dialogue#JULIA=As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
Dialogue#JULIA=I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
Dialogue#JULIA=Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
Dialogue#JULIA=And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
Dialogue#JULIA=Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
Dialogue#JULIA=Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;
Dialogue#JULIA=And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
Dialogue#JULIA=But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
Dialogue#JULIA=Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
Dialogue#JULIA=Till I have found each letter in the letter,
Dialogue#JULIA=Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
Dialogue#JULIA=Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
Dialogue#JULIA=And throw it thence into the raging sea!
Dialogue#JULIA=Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
Dialogue#JULIA='Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
Dialogue#JULIA=To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
Dialogue#JULIA=And yet I will not, sith so prettily

Dialogue#JULIA=If you respect them, best to take them up.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.
Dialogue#JULIA=I see you have a month's mind to them.

Notice#Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
Dialogue#PANTHINO='Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Why, what of him?
Dialogue#PANTHINO=                  He wonder'd that your lordship
Dialogue#PANTHINO=Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
Dialogue#PANTHINO=While other men, of slender reputation,
Dialogue#PANTHINO=Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
Dialogue#PANTHINO=Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
Dialogue#PANTHINO=Some to discover islands far away;
Dialogue#PANTHINO=Some to the studious universities.
Dialogue#PANTHINO=For any or for all these exercises,
Dialogue#PANTHINO=He said that Proteus your son was meet,
Dialogue#PANTHINO=And did request me to importune you
Dialogue#PANTHINO=To let him spend his time no more at home,
Dialogue#PANTHINO=Which would be great impeachment to his age,
Dialogue#PANTHINO=In having known no travel in his youth.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Whereon this month I have been hammering.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I have consider'd well his loss of time
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And how he cannot be a perfect man,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Experience is by industry achieved
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And perfected by the swift course of time.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?
Dialogue#PANTHINO=I think your lordship is not ignorant
Dialogue#PANTHINO=How his companion, youthful Valentine,
Dialogue#PANTHINO=Attends the emperor in his royal court.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I know it well.
Dialogue#PANTHINO='Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
Dialogue#PANTHINO=There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,
Dialogue#PANTHINO=Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.
Dialogue#PANTHINO=And be in eye of every exercise
Dialogue#PANTHINO=Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=The execution of it shall make known.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Even with the speediest expedition
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.
Dialogue#PANTHINO=To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,
Dialogue#PANTHINO=With other gentlemen of good esteem,
Dialogue#PANTHINO=Are journeying to salute the emperor
Dialogue#PANTHINO=And to commend their service to his will.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Good company; with them shall Proteus go:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And, in good time! now will we break with him.
Notice#Enter PROTEUS
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=To seal our happiness with their consents!
Dialogue#PROTEUS=O heavenly Julia!
Dialogue#ANTONIO=How now! what letter are you reading there?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Of commendations sent from Valentine,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=There is no news, my lord, but that he writes
Dialogue#PROTEUS=How happily he lives, how well beloved
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And daily graced by the emperor;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=And how stand you affected to his wish?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=As one relying on your lordship's will
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And not depending on his friendly wish.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=My will is something sorted with his wish.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;
Dialogue#ANTONIO=For what I will, I will, and there an end.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
Dialogue#ANTONIO=With Valentinus in the emperor's court:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=What maintenance he from his friends receives,
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=To-morrow be in readiness to go:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Please you, deliberate a day or two.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:
Dialogue#ANTONIO=No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.
Dialogue#ANTONIO=Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd
Dialogue#ANTONIO=To hasten on his expedition.
Notice#Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO

Dialogue#PROTEUS=Lest he should take exceptions to my love;

Dialogue#PROTEUS=O, how this spring of love resembleth

Dialogue#SPEED=Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Ah, Silvia, Silvia!
Dialogue#SPEED=Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
Dialogue#VALENTINE=How now, sirrah?
Dialogue#SPEED=She is not within hearing, sir.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Why, sir, who bade you call her?
Dialogue#SPEED=Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Well, you'll still be too forward.
Dialogue#SPEED=And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
Dialogue#SPEED=She that your worship loves?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Why, how know you that I am in love?
Dialogue#SPEED=Marry, by these special marks: first, you have
Dialogue#SPEED=learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,
Dialogue#SPEED=like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a
Dialogue#SPEED=robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had
Dialogue#SPEED=the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had
Dialogue#SPEED=lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had
Dialogue#SPEED=buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes
Dialogue#SPEED=diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to
Dialogue#SPEED=speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were
Dialogue#SPEED=wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you
Dialogue#SPEED=walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you
Dialogue#SPEED=fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you
Dialogue#SPEED=looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you
Dialogue#SPEED=are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look
Dialogue#SPEED=on you, I can hardly think you my master.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Are all these things perceived in me?
Dialogue#SPEED=They are all perceived without ye.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Without me? they cannot.
Dialogue#SPEED=Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you
Dialogue#SPEED=were so simple, none else would: but you are so
Dialogue#SPEED=without these follies, that these follies are within
Dialogue#SPEED=you and shine through you like the water in an
Dialogue#SPEED=urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a
Dialogue#SPEED=physician to comment on your malady.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
Dialogue#SPEED=She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.
Dialogue#SPEED=Why, sir, I know her not.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet
Dialogue#VALENTINE=knowest her not?
Dialogue#SPEED=Is she not hard-favoured, sir?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.
Dialogue#SPEED=Sir, I know that well enough.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=What dost thou know?
Dialogue#SPEED=That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.
Dialogue#SPEED=That's because the one is painted and the other out
Dialogue#SPEED=of all count.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=How painted? and how out of count?
Dialogue#SPEED=Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no
Dialogue#SPEED=man counts of her beauty.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.
Dialogue#SPEED=You never saw her since she was deformed.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=How long hath she been deformed?
Dialogue#SPEED=Ever since you loved her.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I
Dialogue#VALENTINE=see her beautiful.
Dialogue#SPEED=If you love her, you cannot see her.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Why?
Dialogue#SPEED=Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;
Dialogue#SPEED=or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
Dialogue#SPEED=have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
Dialogue#SPEED=ungartered!
Dialogue#VALENTINE=What should I see then?
Dialogue#SPEED=Your own present folly and her passing deformity:
Dialogue#SPEED=for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
Dialogue#SPEED=hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last
Dialogue#VALENTINE=morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
Dialogue#SPEED=True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,
Dialogue#SPEED=you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
Dialogue#SPEED=bolder to chide you for yours.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=In conclusion, I stand affected to her.

Dialogue#VALENTINE=But for my duty to your ladyship.
Dialogue#SILVIA=I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=For being ignorant to whom it goes
Dialogue#VALENTINE=I writ at random, very doubtfully.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Perchance you think too much of so much pains?

Dialogue#SILVIA=Nay, take them.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Madam, they are for you.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;

Dialogue#SPEED=Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;

Dialogue#VALENTINE=Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
Dialogue#VALENTINE=With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=For in revenge of my contempt of love,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
Dialogue#VALENTINE=And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=There is no woe to his correction,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Now no discourse, except it be of love;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Upon the very naked name of love.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Was this the idol that you worship so?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=No; but she is an earthly paragon.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Call her divine.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=                  I will not flatter her.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And I must minister the like to you.

Dialogue#VALENTINE=To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=She is alone.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=                  Then let her alone.

Dialogue#PROTEUS=Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--
Dialogue#PROTEUS=That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,

Dialogue#PROTEUS=And that's the reason I love him so little.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=How shall I dote on her with more advice,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=That thus without advice begin to love her!
Dialogue#PROTEUS='Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And that hath dazzled my reason's light;

Dialogue#PROTEUS=I to myself am dearer than a friend,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=For love is still most precious in itself;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=I will forget that Julia is alive,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Remembering that my love to her is dead;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=I cannot now prove constant to myself,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Without some treachery used to Valentine.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
Dialogue#PROTEUS=To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Myself in counsel, his competitor.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Now presently I'll give her father notice
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Of their disguising and pretended flight;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross
Dialogue#PROTEUS=By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!

Notice#Enter JULIA and LUCETTA
Dialogue#JULIA=Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
Dialogue#JULIA=And even in kind love I do conjure thee,
Dialogue#JULIA=Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
Dialogue#JULIA=Are visibly character'd and engraved,
Dialogue#JULIA=To lesson me and tell me some good mean
Dialogue#JULIA=How, with my honour, I may undertake
Dialogue#JULIA=A journey to my loving Proteus.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
Dialogue#JULIA=A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
Dialogue#JULIA=To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
Dialogue#JULIA=Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
Dialogue#JULIA=And when the flight is made to one so dear,
Dialogue#JULIA=Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Better forbear till Proteus make return.
Dialogue#JULIA=O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
Dialogue#JULIA=Pity the dearth that I have pined in,
Dialogue#JULIA=By longing for that food so long a time.
Dialogue#JULIA=Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
Dialogue#JULIA=Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
Dialogue#JULIA=As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
Dialogue#LUCETTA=But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
Dialogue#JULIA=The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
Dialogue#JULIA=The current that with gentle murmur glides,
Dialogue#JULIA=Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
Dialogue#JULIA=But when his fair course is not hindered,
Dialogue#JULIA=He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,
Dialogue#JULIA=Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
Dialogue#JULIA=He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,
Dialogue#JULIA=And so by many winding nooks he strays
Dialogue#JULIA=With willing sport to the wild ocean.
Dialogue#JULIA=Then let me go and hinder not my course
Dialogue#JULIA=I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
Dialogue#JULIA=And make a pastime of each weary step,
Dialogue#JULIA=Till the last step have brought me to my love;
Dialogue#JULIA=And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil
Dialogue#JULIA=A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=But in what habit will you go along?
Dialogue#JULIA=Not like a woman; for I would prevent
Dialogue#JULIA=The loose encounters of lascivious men:
Dialogue#JULIA=Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
Dialogue#JULIA=As may beseem some well-reputed page.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
Dialogue#JULIA=No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
Dialogue#JULIA=With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
Dialogue#JULIA=To be fantastic may become a youth
Dialogue#JULIA=Of greater time than I shall show to be.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?
Dialogue#JULIA=That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
Dialogue#JULIA=What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
Dialogue#JULIA=Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
Dialogue#JULIA=Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.
Dialogue#JULIA=Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have
Dialogue#JULIA=What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
Dialogue#JULIA=But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
Dialogue#JULIA=For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
Dialogue#JULIA=I fear me, it will make me scandalized.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
Dialogue#JULIA=Nay, that I will not.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Then never dream on infamy, but go.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=If Proteus like your journey when you come,
Dialogue#LUCETTA=No matter who's displeased when you are gone:
Dialogue#LUCETTA=I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.
Dialogue#JULIA=That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
Dialogue#JULIA=A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears
Dialogue#JULIA=And instances of infinite of love
Dialogue#JULIA=Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=All these are servants to deceitful men.
Dialogue#JULIA=Base men, that use them to so base effect!
Dialogue#JULIA=But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth
Dialogue#JULIA=His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
Dialogue#JULIA=His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
Dialogue#JULIA=His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
Dialogue#JULIA=His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.
Dialogue#LUCETTA=Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!
Dialogue#JULIA=Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong
Dialogue#JULIA=To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
Dialogue#JULIA=Only deserve my love by loving him;
Dialogue#JULIA=And presently go with me to my chamber,
Dialogue#JULIA=To take a note of what I stand in need of,
Dialogue#JULIA=To furnish me upon my longing journey.
Dialogue#JULIA=All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
Dialogue#JULIA=My goods, my lands, my reputation;
Dialogue#JULIA=Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
Dialogue#JULIA=Come, answer not, but to it presently!
Dialogue#JULIA=I am impatient of my tarriance.

Notice#Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS
Dialogue#DUKE=Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;
Dialogue#DUKE=We have some secrets to confer about.
Notice#Exit THURIO
Dialogue#DUKE=Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=My gracious lord, that which I would discover
Dialogue#PROTEUS=The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=But when I call to mind your gracious favours
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Done to me, undeserving as I am,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=My duty pricks me on to utter that
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=This night intends to steal away your daughter:
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Myself am one made privy to the plot.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=I know you have determined to bestow her
Dialogue#PROTEUS=On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And should she thus be stol'n away from you,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=It would be much vexation to your age.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
Dialogue#PROTEUS=To cross my friend in his intended drift
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
Dialogue#PROTEUS=A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.
Dialogue#DUKE=Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
Dialogue#DUKE=Which to requite, command me while I live.
Dialogue#DUKE=This love of theirs myself have often seen,
Dialogue#DUKE=Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
Dialogue#DUKE=And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
Dialogue#DUKE=Sir Valentine her company and my court:
Dialogue#DUKE=But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
Dialogue#DUKE=And so unworthily disgrace the man,
Dialogue#DUKE=A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
Dialogue#DUKE=I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
Dialogue#DUKE=That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
Dialogue#DUKE=And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
Dialogue#DUKE=Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
Dialogue#DUKE=I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
Dialogue#DUKE=The key whereof myself have ever kept;
Dialogue#DUKE=And thence she cannot be convey'd away.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
Dialogue#PROTEUS=How he her chamber-window will ascend
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=For which the youthful lover now is gone
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And this way comes he with it presently;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly
Dialogue#PROTEUS=That my discovery be not aimed at;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Hath made me publisher of this pretence.
Dialogue#DUKE=Upon mine honour, he shall never know
Dialogue#DUKE=That I had any light from thee of this.

Dialogue#DUKE=Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Please it your grace, there is a messenger
Dialogue#VALENTINE=That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=And I am going to deliver them.
Dialogue#DUKE=Be they of much import?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=The tenor of them doth but signify
Dialogue#VALENTINE=My health and happy being at your court.
Dialogue#DUKE=Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
Dialogue#DUKE=I am to break with thee of some affairs
Dialogue#DUKE=That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
Dialogue#DUKE='Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
Dialogue#DUKE=To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
Dialogue#DUKE=No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
Dialogue#DUKE=Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
Dialogue#DUKE=Neither regarding that she is my child
Dialogue#DUKE=Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
Dialogue#DUKE=And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
Dialogue#DUKE=Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
Dialogue#DUKE=And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
Dialogue#DUKE=Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,
Dialogue#DUKE=I now am full resolved to take a wife
Dialogue#DUKE=And turn her out to who will take her in:
Dialogue#DUKE=Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
Dialogue#DUKE=For me and my possessions she esteems not.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=What would your Grace have me to do in this?
Dialogue#DUKE=There is a lady in Verona here
Dialogue#DUKE=Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy
Dialogue#DUKE=And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
Dialogue#DUKE=Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--
Dialogue#DUKE=For long agone I have forgot to court;
Dialogue#DUKE=Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--
Dialogue#DUKE=How and which way I may bestow myself
Dialogue#DUKE=To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
Dialogue#VALENTINE=More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
Dialogue#DUKE=But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Send her another; never give her o'er;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=But rather to beget more love in you:
Dialogue#VALENTINE=If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
Dialogue#DUKE=But she I mean is promised by her friends
Dialogue#DUKE=Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
Dialogue#DUKE=And kept severely from resort of men,
Dialogue#DUKE=That no man hath access by day to her.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Why, then, I would resort to her by night.
Dialogue#DUKE=Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
Dialogue#DUKE=That no man hath recourse to her by night.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=What lets but one may enter at her window?
Dialogue#DUKE=Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
Dialogue#DUKE=And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
Dialogue#DUKE=Without apparent hazard of his life.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=So bold Leander would adventure it.
Dialogue#DUKE=Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
Dialogue#DUKE=Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.
Dialogue#DUKE=This very night; for Love is like a child,
Dialogue#DUKE=That longs for every thing that he can come by.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
Dialogue#DUKE=But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:
Dialogue#DUKE=How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Under a cloak that is of any length.
Dialogue#DUKE=A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Ay, my good lord.
Dialogue#DUKE=                  Then let me see thy cloak:
Dialogue#DUKE=I'll get me one of such another length.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
Dialogue#DUKE=How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
Dialogue#DUKE=I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.

Dialogue#DUKE=While I, their king, that hither them importune,

Dialogue#DUKE=Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
Dialogue#DUKE=Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
Dialogue#DUKE=Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,

Dialogue#DUKE=Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
Dialogue#DUKE=But if thou linger in my territories
Dialogue#DUKE=Longer than swiftest expedition
Dialogue#DUKE=Will give thee time to leave our royal court,

Dialogue#SPEED='Item: She can knit.'
Dialogue#LAUNCE=What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when

Dialogue#LAUNCE=Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can
Dialogue#LAUNCE=spin for her living.
Dialogue#SPEED='Item: She hath many nameless virtues.'

Dialogue#SPEED='Item: She doth talk in her sleep.'
Dialogue#LAUNCE=It's no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.
Dialogue#SPEED='Item: She is slow in words.'
Dialogue#LAUNCE=O villain, that set this down among her vices! To
Dialogue#LAUNCE=be slow in words is a woman's only virtue: I pray
Dialogue#LAUNCE=thee, out with't, and place it for her chief virtue.
Dialogue#SPEED='Item: She is proud.'
Dialogue#LAUNCE=Out with that too; it was Eve's legacy, and cannot
Dialogue#LAUNCE=be ta'en from her.
Dialogue#SPEED='Item: She hath no teeth.'
Dialogue#LAUNCE=I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.
Dialogue#SPEED='Item: She is curst.'
Dialogue#LAUNCE=Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.
Dialogue#SPEED='Item: She will often praise her liquor.'
Dialogue#LAUNCE=If her liquor be good, she shall: if she will not, I
Dialogue#LAUNCE=will; for good things should be praised.
Dialogue#SPEED='Item: She is too liberal.'
Dialogue#LAUNCE=Of her tongue she cannot, for that's writ down she
Dialogue#LAUNCE=is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that
Dialogue#LAUNCE=I'll keep shut: now, of another thing she may, and
Dialogue#LAUNCE=that cannot I help. Well, proceed.
Dialogue#SPEED='Item: She hath more hair than wit, and more faults
Dialogue#SPEED=than hairs, and more wealth than faults.'
Dialogue#LAUNCE=Stop there; I'll have her: she was mine, and not
Dialogue#LAUNCE=mine, twice or thrice in that last article.
Dialogue#LAUNCE=Rehearse that once more.
Dialogue#SPEED='Item: She hath more hair than wit,'--

Dialogue#LAUNCE=That's monstrous: O, that that were out!
Dialogue#SPEED='And more wealth than faults.'
Dialogue#LAUNCE=Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well,

Dialogue#LAUNCE=impossible,--
Dialogue#SPEED=What then?
Dialogue#LAUNCE=Why, then will I tell thee--that thy master stays
Dialogue#LAUNCE=for thee at the North-gate.
Dialogue#SPEED=For me?
Dialogue#LAUNCE=For thee! ay, who art thou? he hath stayed for a
Dialogue#LAUNCE=better man than thee.
Dialogue#SPEED=And must I go to him?

Notice#Enter DUKE and THURIO
Dialogue#DUKE=Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,
Dialogue#DUKE=Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.
Dialogue#THURIO=Since his exile she hath despised me most,
Dialogue#THURIO=Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,
Dialogue#THURIO=That I am desperate of obtaining her.
Dialogue#DUKE=This weak impress of love is as a figure
Dialogue#DUKE=Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
Dialogue#DUKE=Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
Dialogue#DUKE=A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
Dialogue#DUKE=And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
Notice#Enter PROTEUS
Dialogue#DUKE=How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman
Dialogue#DUKE=According to our proclamation gone?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Gone, my good lord.
Dialogue#DUKE=My daughter takes his going grievously.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.
Dialogue#DUKE=So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
Dialogue#DUKE=Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--
Dialogue#DUKE=For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--
Dialogue#DUKE=Makes me the better to confer with thee.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Longer than I prove loyal to your grace
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Let me not live to look upon your grace.
Dialogue#DUKE=Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
Dialogue#DUKE=The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=I do, my lord.
Dialogue#DUKE=And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
Dialogue#DUKE=How she opposes her against my will
Dialogue#PROTEUS=She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
Dialogue#DUKE=Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
Dialogue#DUKE=What might we do to make the girl forget
Dialogue#DUKE=The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=The best way is to slander Valentine
Dialogue#PROTEUS=With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Three things that women highly hold in hate.
Dialogue#DUKE=Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Ay, if his enemy deliver it:
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
Dialogue#PROTEUS=By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
Dialogue#DUKE=Then you must undertake to slander him.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:
Dialogue#PROTEUS='Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Especially against his very friend.
Dialogue#DUKE=Where your good word cannot advantage him,
Dialogue#DUKE=Your slander never can endamage him;
Dialogue#DUKE=Therefore the office is indifferent,
Dialogue#DUKE=Being entreated to it by your friend.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it
Dialogue#PROTEUS=By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=She shall not long continue love to him.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=But say this weed her love from Valentine,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
Dialogue#THURIO=Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
Dialogue#THURIO=Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
Dialogue#THURIO=You must provide to bottom it on me;
Dialogue#THURIO=Which must be done by praising me as much
Dialogue#THURIO=As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
Dialogue#DUKE=And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
Dialogue#DUKE=Because we know, on Valentine's report,
Dialogue#DUKE=You are already Love's firm votary
Dialogue#DUKE=And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
Dialogue#DUKE=Upon this warrant shall you have access
Dialogue#DUKE=Where you with Silvia may confer at large;
Dialogue#DUKE=For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
Dialogue#DUKE=And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;
Dialogue#DUKE=Where you may temper her by your persuasion
Dialogue#DUKE=To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=As much as I can do, I will effect:
Dialogue#PROTEUS=But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=You must lay lime to tangle her desires
Dialogue#PROTEUS=By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
Dialogue#DUKE=Ay,
Dialogue#DUKE=Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Say that upon the altar of her beauty
Dialogue#PROTEUS=You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
Dialogue#PROTEUS=That may discover such integrity:
Dialogue#PROTEUS=For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=After your dire-lamenting elegies,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
Dialogue#PROTEUS=With some sweet concert; to their instruments
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=This, or else nothing, will inherit her.
Dialogue#DUKE=This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
Dialogue#THURIO=And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.
Dialogue#THURIO=Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
Dialogue#THURIO=Let us into the city presently
Dialogue#THURIO=To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
Dialogue#THURIO=I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
Dialogue#THURIO=To give the onset to thy good advice.
Dialogue#DUKE=About it, gentlemen!
Dialogue#PROTEUS=We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And afterward determine our proceedings.
Dialogue#DUKE=Even now about it! I will pardon you.

Dialogue#VALENTINE=My friends,--
Dialogue#First Outlaw=That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.
Dialogue#Second Outlaw=Peace! we'll hear him.
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Then know that I have little wealth to lose:
Dialogue#VALENTINE=A man I am cross'd with adversity;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=My riches are these poor habiliments,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Of which if you should here disfurnish me,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=You take the sum and substance that I have.
Dialogue#Second Outlaw=Whither travel you?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=To Verona.
Dialogue#First Outlaw=Whence came you?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=From Milan.
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=Have you long sojourned there?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.
Dialogue#First Outlaw=What, were you banish'd thence?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=I was.
Dialogue#Second Outlaw=For what offence?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=For that which now torments me to rehearse:
Dialogue#VALENTINE=I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Bu t yet I slew him manfully in fight,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Without false vantage or base treachery.
Dialogue#First Outlaw=Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
Dialogue#First Outlaw=But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=I was, and held me glad of such a doom.
Dialogue#Second Outlaw=Have you the tongues?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=My youthful travel therein made me happy,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Or else I often had been miserable.
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=This fellow were a king for our wild faction!
Dialogue#First Outlaw=We'll have him. Sirs, a word.
Dialogue#SPEED=Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind of thievery.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Peace, villain!
Dialogue#Second Outlaw=Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Nothing but my fortune.
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=Thrust from the company of awful men:
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=Myself was from Verona banished
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=For practising to steal away a lady,
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=An heir, and near allied unto the duke.
Dialogue#Second Outlaw=And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,
Dialogue#Second Outlaw=Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.
Dialogue#First Outlaw=And I for such like petty crimes as these,
Dialogue#First Outlaw=But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,
Dialogue#First Outlaw=That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;
Dialogue#First Outlaw=And partly, seeing you are beautified
Dialogue#First Outlaw=With goodly shape and by your own report
Dialogue#First Outlaw=A linguist and a man of such perfection
Dialogue#First Outlaw=As we do in our quality much want--
Dialogue#Second Outlaw=Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
Dialogue#Second Outlaw=Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:
Dialogue#Second Outlaw=Are you content to be our general?
Dialogue#Second Outlaw=To make a virtue of necessity
Dialogue#Second Outlaw=And live, as we do, in this wilderness?
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=Say ay, and be the captain of us all:
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=Love thee as our commander and our king.
Dialogue#First Outlaw=But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.
Dialogue#Second Outlaw=Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=I take your offer and will live with you,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Provided that you do no outrages
Dialogue#VALENTINE=On silly women or poor passengers.
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=No, we detest such vile base practises.
Dialogue#Third Outlaw=Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,

Dialogue#PROTEUS=To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=When I protest true loyalty to her,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=When to her beauty I commend my vows,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=She bids me think how I have been forsworn
Dialogue#PROTEUS=In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,

Dialogue#Host=Is she kind as she is fair?
Dialogue#Host=For beauty lives with kindness.
Dialogue#Host=Love doth to her eyes repair,

Dialogue#Host=And, being help'd, inhabits there.
Dialogue#Host=Then to Silvia let us sing,
Dialogue#Host=That Silvia is excelling;
Dialogue#Host=She excels each mortal thing

Dialogue#Host=Why, my pretty youth?
Dialogue#JULIA=He plays false, father.
Dialogue#Host=How? out of tune on the strings?
Dialogue#JULIA=Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very
Dialogue#JULIA=heart-strings.
Dialogue#Host=You have a quick ear.
Dialogue#JULIA=Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.
Dialogue#Host=I perceive you delight not in music.
Dialogue#JULIA=Not a whit, when it jars so.
Dialogue#Host=Hark, what fine change is in the music!
Dialogue#JULIA=Ay, that change is the spite.

Dialogue#SILVIA=Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!
Dialogue#SILVIA=Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
Dialogue#SILVIA=To be seduced by thy flattery,

Dialogue#PROTEUS=For since the substance of your perfect self

Dialogue#JULIA=[Aside]  If 'twere a substance, you would, sure,

Dialogue#LAUNCE=I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
Dialogue#LAUNCE='thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver
Dialogue#LAUNCE=him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;
Dialogue#LAUNCE=and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
Dialogue#LAUNCE=steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:
Dialogue#LAUNCE=O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
Dialogue#LAUNCE=in all companies! I would have, as one should say,
Dialogue#LAUNCE=one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,
Dialogue#LAUNCE=as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had
Dialogue#LAUNCE=more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,
Dialogue#LAUNCE=I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I
Dialogue#LAUNCE=live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He
Dialogue#LAUNCE=thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
Dialogue#LAUNCE=gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had
Dialogue#LAUNCE=not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but
Dialogue#LAUNCE=all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
Dialogue#LAUNCE=one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
Dialogue#LAUNCE=out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
Dialogue#LAUNCE=I, having been acquainted with the smell before,
Dialogue#LAUNCE=knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
Dialogue#LAUNCE=whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip
Dialogue#LAUNCE=the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him
Dialogue#LAUNCE=the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you
Dialogue#LAUNCE=wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out
Dialogue#LAUNCE=of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
Dialogue#LAUNCE=his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the
Dialogue#LAUNCE=stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had
Dialogue#LAUNCE=been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese
Dialogue#LAUNCE=he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.
Dialogue#LAUNCE=Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the
Dialogue#LAUNCE=trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
Dialogue#LAUNCE=Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I

Dialogue#LAUNCE=currish thanks is good enough for such a present.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=But she received my dog?
Dialogue#LAUNCE=No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him
Dialogue#LAUNCE=back again.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=What, didst thou offer her this from me?
Dialogue#LAUNCE=Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by
Dialogue#LAUNCE=the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
Dialogue#LAUNCE=offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of
Dialogue#LAUNCE=yours, and therefore the gift the greater.

Dialogue#JULIA=She is dead, belike?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Not so; I think she lives.
Dialogue#JULIA=Alas!
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Why dost thou cry 'alas'?
Dialogue#JULIA=I cannot choose
Dialogue#JULIA=But pity her.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=                  Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
Dialogue#JULIA=Because methinks that she loved you as well
Dialogue#JULIA=As you do love your lady Silvia:
Dialogue#JULIA=She dreams of him that has forgot her love;
Dialogue#JULIA=You dote on her that cares not for your love.
Dialogue#JULIA='Tis pity love should be so contrary;
Dialogue#JULIA=And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Well, give her that ring and therewithal
Dialogue#PROTEUS=This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
Dialogue#PROTEUS=I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.

Dialogue#JULIA=How many women would do such a message?
Dialogue#JULIA=Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd
Dialogue#JULIA=A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
Dialogue#JULIA=Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
Dialogue#JULIA=That with his very heart despiseth me?
Dialogue#JULIA=Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
Dialogue#JULIA=Because I love him I must pity him.
Dialogue#JULIA=This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
Dialogue#JULIA=To bind him to remember my good will;
Dialogue#JULIA=And now am I, unhappy messenger,
Dialogue#JULIA=To plead for that which I would not obtain,
Dialogue#JULIA=To carry that which I would have refused,
Dialogue#JULIA=To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
Dialogue#JULIA=I am my master's true-confirmed love;
Dialogue#JULIA=But cannot be true servant to my master,
Dialogue#JULIA=Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
Dialogue#JULIA=Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
Dialogue#JULIA=As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
Notice#Enter SILVIA, attended
Dialogue#JULIA=Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean
Dialogue#JULIA=To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
Dialogue#SILVIA=What would you with her, if that I be she?
Dialogue#JULIA=If you be she, I do entreat your patience
Dialogue#JULIA=To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
Dialogue#SILVIA=From whom?
Dialogue#JULIA=From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
Dialogue#SILVIA=O, he sends you for a picture.
Dialogue#JULIA=Ay, madam.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Ursula, bring my picture here.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Go give your master this: tell him from me,
Dialogue#SILVIA=One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
Dialogue#SILVIA=Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
Dialogue#JULIA=Madam, please you peruse this letter.--
Dialogue#JULIA=Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised
Dialogue#JULIA=Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
Dialogue#JULIA=This is the letter to your ladyship.
Dialogue#SILVIA=I pray thee, let me look on that again.
Dialogue#JULIA=It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
Dialogue#SILVIA=There, hold!
Dialogue#SILVIA=I will not look upon your master's lines:
Dialogue#SILVIA=I know they are stuff'd with protestations
Dialogue#SILVIA=And full of new-found oaths; which he will break
Dialogue#SILVIA=As easily as I do tear his paper.
Dialogue#JULIA=Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
Dialogue#SILVIA=The more shame for him that he sends it me;
Dialogue#SILVIA=For I have heard him say a thousand times
Dialogue#SILVIA=His Julia gave it him at his departure.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
Dialogue#SILVIA=Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
Dialogue#JULIA=She thanks you.
Dialogue#SILVIA=What say'st thou?
Dialogue#JULIA=I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
Dialogue#JULIA=Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Dost thou know her?
Dialogue#JULIA=Almost as well as I do know myself:
Dialogue#JULIA=To think upon her woes I do protest
Dialogue#JULIA=That I have wept a hundred several times.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
Dialogue#JULIA=I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Is she not passing fair?
Dialogue#JULIA=She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:
Dialogue#JULIA=When she did think my master loved her well,
Dialogue#JULIA=She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:
Dialogue#JULIA=But since she did neglect her looking-glass
Dialogue#JULIA=And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
Dialogue#JULIA=The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
Dialogue#JULIA=And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
Dialogue#JULIA=That now she is become as black as I.
Dialogue#SILVIA=How tall was she?
Dialogue#JULIA=About my stature; for at Pentecost,
Dialogue#JULIA=When all our pageants of delight were play'd,
Dialogue#JULIA=Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
Dialogue#JULIA=And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,
Dialogue#JULIA=Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,
Dialogue#JULIA=As if the garment had been made for me:
Dialogue#JULIA=Therefore I know she is about my height.
Dialogue#JULIA=And at that time I made her weep agood,
Dialogue#JULIA=For I did play a lamentable part:
Dialogue#JULIA=Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
Dialogue#JULIA=For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
Dialogue#JULIA=Which I so lively acted with my tears
Dialogue#JULIA=That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
Dialogue#JULIA=Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
Dialogue#JULIA=If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
Dialogue#SILVIA=She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
Dialogue#SILVIA=I weep myself to think upon thy words.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this
Dialogue#SILVIA=For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Farewell.
Notice#Exit SILVIA, with attendants
Dialogue#JULIA=And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
Dialogue#JULIA=A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful
Dialogue#JULIA=I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
Dialogue#JULIA=Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
Dialogue#JULIA=Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
Dialogue#JULIA=Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
Dialogue#JULIA=If I had such a tire, this face of mine
Dialogue#JULIA=Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
Dialogue#JULIA=And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
Dialogue#JULIA=Unless I flatter with myself too much.
Dialogue#JULIA=Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:
Dialogue#JULIA=If that be all the difference in his love,
Dialogue#JULIA=I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
Dialogue#JULIA=Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
Dialogue#JULIA=Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.
Dialogue#JULIA=What should it be that he respects in her
Dialogue#JULIA=But I can make respective in myself,
Dialogue#JULIA=If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
Dialogue#JULIA=Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,
Dialogue#JULIA=For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,
Dialogue#JULIA=Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!
Dialogue#JULIA=And, were there sense in his idolatry,
Dialogue#JULIA=My substance should be statue in thy stead.
Dialogue#JULIA=I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
Dialogue#JULIA=That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,
Dialogue#JULIA=I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
Dialogue#JULIA=To make my master out of love with thee!

Dialogue#THURIO=Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
Dialogue#THURIO=What, that my leg is too long?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=No; that it is too little.
Dialogue#THURIO=I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.
Dialogue#JULIA=[Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what
Dialogue#JULIA=it loathes.
Dialogue#THURIO=What says she to my face?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=She says it is a fair one.
Dialogue#THURIO=Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.
Dialogue#JULIA=[Aside]  'Tis true; such pearls as put out
Dialogue#JULIA=ladies' eyes;
Dialogue#JULIA=For I had rather wink than look on them.
Dialogue#THURIO=How likes she my discourse?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Ill, when you talk of war.
Dialogue#THURIO=But well, when I discourse of love and peace?
Dialogue#JULIA=[Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
Dialogue#THURIO=What says she to my valour?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
Dialogue#JULIA=[Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
Dialogue#THURIO=What says she to my birth?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=That you are well derived.
Dialogue#JULIA=[Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.
Dialogue#THURIO=Considers she my possessions?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=O, ay; and pities them.
Dialogue#THURIO=Wherefore?
Dialogue#JULIA=[Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=That they are out by lease.

Dialogue#DUKE=How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!

Dialogue#THURIO=Not I.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=     Nor I.
Dialogue#DUKE=          Saw you my daughter?
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Neither.
Dialogue#DUKE=Why then,
Dialogue#DUKE=She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;
Dialogue#DUKE=And Eglamour is in her company.
Dialogue#DUKE='Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
Dialogue#DUKE=As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
Dialogue#DUKE=Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
Dialogue#DUKE=But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;
Dialogue#DUKE=Besides, she did intend confession
Dialogue#DUKE=At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
Dialogue#DUKE=These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
Dialogue#DUKE=Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
Dialogue#DUKE=But mount you presently and meet with me
Dialogue#DUKE=Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
Dialogue#DUKE=That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:
Dialogue#DUKE=Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.

Dialogue#THURIO=Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,

Dialogue#PROTEUS=And I will follow, more for Silvia's love

Dialogue#VALENTINE=O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
Dialogue#VALENTINE=And leave no memory of what it was!

Dialogue#PROTEUS=Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=[Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
Dialogue#SILVIA=O miserable, unhappy that I am!
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
Dialogue#PROTEUS=But by my coming I have made you happy.
Dialogue#SILVIA=By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.
Dialogue#JULIA=[Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
Dialogue#SILVIA=I would have been a breakfast to the beast,

Dialogue#SILVIA=O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
Dialogue#SILVIA=Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
Dialogue#SILVIA=And full as much, for more there cannot be,
Dialogue#SILVIA=I do detest false perjured Proteus.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Would I not undergo for one calm look!
Dialogue#PROTEUS=O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=When women cannot love where they're beloved!
Dialogue#SILVIA=When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
Dialogue#SILVIA=For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
Dialogue#SILVIA=Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
Dialogue#SILVIA=Descended into perjury, to love me.
Dialogue#SILVIA=Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;
Dialogue#SILVIA=And that's far worse than none; better have none
Dialogue#SILVIA=Than plural faith which is too much by one:
Dialogue#SILVIA=Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
Dialogue#PROTEUS=In love
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Who respects friend?
Dialogue#SILVIA=All men but Proteus.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Can no way change you to a milder form,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.
Dialogue#SILVIA=O heaven!
Dialogue#PROTEUS=        I'll force thee yield to my desire.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Thou friend of an ill fashion!
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Valentine!
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=For such is a friend now; treacherous man!
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
Dialogue#VALENTINE=I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
Dialogue#VALENTINE=But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,
Dialogue#VALENTINE='Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
Dialogue#PROTEUS=My shame and guilt confounds me.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
Dialogue#PROTEUS=I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer
Dialogue#PROTEUS=As e'er I did commit.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Then I am paid;
Dialogue#VALENTINE=And once again I do receive thee honest.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Who by repentance is not satisfied
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.
Dialogue#VALENTINE=By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:

Dialogue#JULIA=O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
Dialogue#JULIA=This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
Dialogue#PROTEUS=I gave this unto Julia.
Dialogue#JULIA=And Julia herself did give it me;
Dialogue#JULIA=And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=How! Julia!
Dialogue#JULIA=Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
Dialogue#JULIA=And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
Dialogue#JULIA=How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
Dialogue#JULIA=O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
Dialogue#JULIA=Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
Dialogue#JULIA=Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
Dialogue#JULIA=In a disguise of love:
Dialogue#JULIA=It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
Dialogue#JULIA=Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Than men their minds! 'tis true.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=O heaven! were man
Dialogue#PROTEUS=But constant, he were perfect. That one error
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
Dialogue#PROTEUS=Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
Dialogue#PROTEUS=What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
Dialogue#PROTEUS=More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Come, come, a hand from either:
Dialogue#VALENTINE=Let me be blest to make this happy close;
